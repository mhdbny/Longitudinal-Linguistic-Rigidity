 1 2007-05-20 Magic Illusions 

 
Opening Words
  
We are here 

on a mid-spring day, to worship, 

to remember with amazement 

that we are part of all that is, 

that we do not have to earn the right to be here,  

but only receive it with gladness. So we say: 

 
As we move through this year of transition and joy,
 we remember with 
gratitude the power of our living heritage, which m
oves through time 
like a clear running creek; 

refreshing us with the sweet draughts of courage, h
ope, justice-
making, peaceful living, ever deeper honesty, and m
ore truthful 
loving. And so we have kindled this light in thanks
giving. 
  
Sequence: 

 
Does the Japanese maple branch first say 

?Abracadabra? before its wine-colored leaves 

unfold and lift their fingers to the sun? 

 
Does dawn have to utter ?alakazaam? in order to rem
ove the purple 
covering of night and reveal the skillfully disappe
ared magician sun 
dressed in a cape of rose and pale yellow? 

 
Do the volunteer cooks making savory meals in our k
itchens to feed the 
homeless who gather at Faith Mission use wands to m
ake their magic? 
 
Do the volunteers who make coffee, or sell books, o
r staff tables, or usher 
our guests, 

or balance the microphone sound, or play the piano,
 or lift their voice, or 
water the plants, or change the light-bulbs, or lif
t stains off the carpet, or 
precisely place the chairs, or hang paintings on th
e wall, or bring roses to 
the sweetly arranged bright boxes, or read from the
 pulpit, or kindle a 

 2 fire–do they each wear pointy hats with stars and m
oons when they join 
together in the sleight-of-hand called Sunday Celeb
ration? 
 
Does the completely wordless silence that now gathe
rs around us like a 
wizard™s wide cape have little magic of its own? 

      
the great silence 
 
Does the sheer fact that we are here mean that we a
re isolated from all that 
live outside these beautiful walls?  Do not those w
e love and miss 
still knock at the door of our hearts?  Are not the
ir names, their memories, 
their stories alive 

inside us right now? Can the speaking of their name
s, the silent 
remembering of their faces, 

not make them appear right now? 

 naming 
 
Does the sorcery of the rising sun, the magic of ma
ples, the enchantment 
of roses, the magus of memory and the divination of
 hope not have their 
match in the spiritual alchemy of music? 

 
Readings: 

 
The First Reading 
comes from magician and illusionist David Blaine™s 
book Mysterious Stranger---  A Book of Magic, writt
en in 2002. If you 
want to see magicians David or Cris/Criss Angel lev
itate, type their name 
into Youtube, and you will find hundreds of example
s. 
 
In the 1800s, two women performers, Lulu Hurst and 
Annie Abbot 
performed feats of strength and resistance using th
e little known laws of 
inertia. Using that principle, you can successfully
 resist the combined 
strength of ten people. Stand facing a wall, with y
our arms fully extended 
and your palms flat against wall. Make sure your fi
ngers point upward.  
 
Then get ten volunteers and put them in size order,
 with the smallest one 
first in line. Have them stand in single file behin
d you, with each one™s 

 3 hands outstretched and placed on the back or should
ers of the person in 
front of them. On the count of three, have them pus
h with all their might, 
and try to pin you against the wall. Of course, the
y can™t, and  their own 
exertions will cause them to be thrown to the groun
d. 
 
Because of the laws of inertia, each person in line
 will absorb the pressure 
of the person directly behind. The combined force o
f all the people behind 
cannot be transferred to the people in front of the
m, so as long as you can 
withstand the force of the person whose immediately
 behind you (the 
smallest person in the group) you™ll be able to hol
d off the entire team. 
 
The Second Reading
 is the wondrous poem of the Pulitzer Prize winning
 
poet, Mary Oliver,  who read last year at General A
ssembly. 
 
The Ponds 

  

Every year 

the lilies 

are so perfect 

I can hardly believe 

  

their lapped light crowding 

the black, 

mid-summer ponds. 

Nobody could count all of them -- 

  

the muskrats swimming 

among the pads and the grasses 

can reach out 

their muscular arms and touch 

  

only so many, they are that 

rife and wild. 

But what in this world 

is perfect? 

  

I bend closer and see 

 4 how this one is clearly lopsided -- 

and that one wears an orange blight -- 

and this one is a glossy cheek 

  

half nibbled away -- 

and that one is a slumped purse 

full of its own 

unstoppable decay. 

  

Still, what I want in my life 

is to be willing 

to be dazzled -- 

to cast aside the weight of facts 

  

and maybe even 

to float a little 

above this difficult world.  

I want to believe I am looking 

  

into the white fire of a great mystery. 

I want to believe that the imperfections are nothin
g -- 
that the light is everything -- that it is more tha
n the sum of each flawed 
blossom rising and fading.   

And I do. 

  

Sermon  

 
I™ve been fascinated by magicians since I was in co
llege. This sweet guy 
named Steve and I worked together washing dishes in
 the cafeteria, and he 
performed a magic trick right in front of my eyes. 
He had told me he was 
studying magic, so naturally I asked him to show me
 a trick or two. He 
agreed to do so the next day. So at work that day h
e brings out three small 
metallic tumblers– you know, like for drinking wate
r. He takes a two-
inch wide ball and puts it under one of them, and t
hen rearranges the 
tumblers in the old shell-game trick, but slow enou
gh for me to figure out 
where the ball still was. I tapped the middle of th
e three confidently. I 

 5 knew it was there. He lifted it. Nothing. I said, ?
Hey, wait a minute. I 
followed that perfectly, it has to be in there.? 

 
He laughed as I lifted up the tumbler to look insid
e. He said, ?Here, I™ll do 
it again.? He put the ball underneath a tumbler, an
d this time in slow 
motion–and I mean REALLY slow motion–he moved the t
umblers 
about. Again, I knew I was right when I tapped the 
left tumbler. The ball 
simply HAD to be under it. 

 
It wasn™t. And Steve laughed at my very visible bef
uddlement. Then he 
said, to my surprise ?Here, I™ll show you how I tri
cked you, even though 
we™re not supposed to reveal our secrets. 

 
First he showed me that what I thought was a ball w
as actually a piece of 
foam rubber fluff. 

It appeared to be solid, but wasn™t, and it didn™t 
weigh more than a piece of 
eiderdown. Then he showed me how he could crush the
 ball small as a pea 
and utterly conceal it in the two smallest fingers 
of his hand, and slip the 
thing under any tumbler he wanted right before my e
yes without me seeing 
a thing. Underneath the tumbler it would immediatel
y spring back to its 
ordinary size. He showed me up close how it was don
e, and I watched, 
amazed at the skill it took to do such a thing with
 confidence right up 
close. But then he got an impish grin in his face, 
and he said: ?Of course, 
that doesn™t explain how THIS happens!?  And with t
hat, he lifted up one 
of the tumblers, and out came a ball three times th
e size of the little ball. I 
picked it up. It wasn™t made of soft material, but 
it was entirely hard rubber 
with no give whatsoever. And, the diameter of the b
all was clearly greater 
than the diameter of the mouth of the tumbler. I co
uldn™t fit the ball back 
into the tumbler because it simply did not fit. 

 
He giggled. I was mystified. Almost mad, because I 
realized that he had 
led me along by claiming to tell me how the trick w
as done, 
and then pulling the carpet out from underneath me 
by showing me a trick 
that reduced his revelation to a mere setup for a g
reater bewilderment. 
 
And that meeting with Steve was the beginning of my
 fascination with the 
skill of magicians. Whether it™s watching Chris Ang
el saw himself in half 

 6 without a box, entirely surrounded by people on a s
tage, or being mystified 
as he appears to read peoples minds; or watching Da
vid Blaine levitate six 
inches off the sidewalk in a Brooklyn neighborhood;
 or watching my old 
magician friend Jim Vetter disappear, just like tha
t, out of a sturdy wooden 
chest set on concrete against a solid brick corner 
in a basement–I simply 
love magic.  I know they™re all tricks, involving i
ntelligence, craft, skill 
and dexterity. Each of these magicians claim that t
hinking is behind their 
tricks, planning and practice, not supernatural age
ncy. None of them think 
they are channeling the forces of fate, or unknown 
and mysterious powers. 
They all admit, candidly, they do not believe that 
such powers or forces are 
anything but a kind of ?magical thinking,? or what 
is sometimes called 
?superstition,? that is, rational thought dressing 
up as a kind of wishing 
well.  Magical thinking is a desire for easy contro
l over the things of this 
world without having to do any of the work, or even
 asking whether 
having control over things is a good idea to begin 
with. 
 
Yes. Real magic is work. Effort. Magician Chris Ang
el says he worked 
ten 
years
 planning this ?sawing in half trick.? Others befor
e him had done 
such tricks using different methods, often involvin
g men who, through a 
terrible accident, had heads and torsos but no legs
. Chris cuts his own body 
in half, however. And he is not inside a box. And o
bviously, he has his 
legs, so his illusion, his magic trick, must be cre
ated differently from the 
earlier version. But however he does it, he creates
 the illusion with skill, 
thoughtfulness and the work of questions and reason
. He does not say a 
private ?abracadabra? and wait for mysterious power
s to descend. 
 
Magic as an art form, a craft, a technique for dazz
ling people, has been 
around from ancient times. Egyptians were famous fo
r their magicians.  
The Book of Exodus in the Torah speaks of them as h
aving similar 
abilities to Moses, able to turn water into blood, 
walking sticks into cobras, 
etc. The New Testament, too, is filled with referen
ces to magicians, like 
Simon, the magician who wanted to purchase the magi
c he ascribed to the 
followers of Jesus. The early catacombs often portr
ay Jesus walking 
around with a magician™s wand. The Gospel of Matthe
w even begins, as I 
said one Christmas Eve, with the story of a group o
f Magi, or Magi, from 
Persia, following a moving star to find Jesus. (The
 English word ?magic? 
comes from their name. This fanciful story about th
e traveling star would 

 7 have been a true horror story to people in the Roma
n era, since such an 
image called into question the dominant philosophy 
of the era. Many 
Romans believed that the stars were fixed to the cr
ystal dome of the sky, 
and represented Fate, or the absolute control of su
perior powers over our 
little human lives.  By saying that a star actually
 moved–not a planet 
mind you, but a true and immobile star– the Magi ta
le was saying that 
there were no mysterious forces or powers controlli
ng human lives, and 
that all human beings are both terribly free and co
mpletely responsible for 
creating their own lives by thinking and reasoning 
for themselves. 
 
But however fascinating its history, real magic req
uires skill and work. It 
requires thinking carefully, weighing everything, t
aking time. It requires 
living in this world. 

 
But ?magical thinking? does not. What is ?magical t
hinking?? ?Magical 
thinking? is an approach to life which acts as if m
agic is not work, but a 
real cause and effect governed by powers we simply 
don™t understand. 
?Magical thinking? is an attitude of conflict-avoid
ance, a belief that 
problems can be solved in some invisible, effortles
s way, without having 
to use the cool, rational craft of magician magic. 
Liberals, conservatives, 
the religious and non-religious all dabble in ?magi
cal thinking.? 
And when I say ?magical thinking,? please, I am not
 just talking about 
people claiming that aliens built the great pyramid
, or that the Nazca lines 
in Chile are runways just because some fool thinks 
they ?look? like 
runways. Those kinds of things are just the frayed 
edge of ?magical 
thinking.? 

 
I want instead to talk about the more ordinary and 
common kinds of 
?magical thinking.? Expecting someone to read your 
mind is a form of 
magical thinking.  Chris Angel only pretends to do 
it. Others actually think 
it™s a possibility. ?He should have known I don™t l
ike broccoli.?  How 
could he have known that unless you told him? No on
e can read minds, not 
even David Blaine or Chris Angel, although both of 
them use rational 
tricks to make you think that. And since I agree th
at no one can really read 
minds, I think the best examples of spiritual life 
in this world are not new 
forms of talking with God, or reading God™s mind, b
ut rather, all those 
times when we take seriously the fact that we have 
to talk with each other 

 8 instead. ?She called me at ten o clock in the eveni
ng. Can you believe that? 
I mean, she should know that™s too late.?  How can 
she know that unless 
you say something? No one can read minds. I think t
hat our spiritual work 
in this life is to live as if that is true. ?I wish
 he would stop being so 
forward. He™s always right up here close to my face
.?  How will 
boundaries be set unless you set them? I assure you
, no magician will 
come along to set them for us. 

 
?Miranda looks so much like my aunt Sophie, who I j
ust couldn™t stand. So 
I don™t even want to be in same room with Miranda b
ecause of that.?  But 
Miranda is not your aunt Sophie, any more than the 
Nazca lines are 
runways. She is Katherine. Her own person. Your spi
ritual work, it seems 
to me, is to not magically make one into the other,
 but to work hard 
refusing to associate your feelings for Sophie with
 your feelings for 
Katherine. It™s to let Katherine be Katherine. 

Don™t magically change her into someone else. 

 
?Magical thinking? has other common forms too.  I™v
e met people who 
ritually criticize themselves in advance, like sort
 of a preemptive strike, so 
that no one else will insult them or hurt them firs
t. Their self-
dumping–?Oh, I can™t sing worth a damn!? is like a 
magic spell to get 
people to say ?Oh, no, you™re a good singer.?   

I™ve met people who are ?worried? when things are g
oing really well in 
their life. So they unconsciously conspire to break
 a vase or knock over a 
glass as a way of magically making something negati
ve happen so that 
their good life might be maintained. When you are f
eeling guilty that 
everything is going right, that too is magical thin
king. I hear folks 
complain about how their religion makes them feel g
uilty, but I have 
observed that an awful lot of people seem to think 
that feeling guilty is 
rather a magic charm. They find it useful. If you f
eel guilty, then you are at 
least suffering a little bit and that should be suf
ficient to get folks off your 
back. 

 
The spiritual life for me is not about other worlds
, or other dimensions of 
reality. The spiritual life is about abandoning tho
se other worlds so I can 
live in this one. Speak to the people I have to spe
ak to.  Tell the truth to 
folks I have not told the truth to before. I have t
o ask others about what 

 9 they want, need, or fear. It can™t magically happen
 by mind-reading or 
worse, assuming they think just like me. They have 
to set their own 
boundaries with me, and I have to set my own bounda
ries with them. 
Neither Merlin nor David Blaine can speak for me. I
 have to speak for 
myself. Others have to speak for themselves, not as
k others to do it for 
them. ?Darlene, sweetheart, can you talk with Johan
na? You know her 
pretty well, don™t you? She always eats candy when 
we go to the movies 
with the most crinkly of wrappers. It™s so distract
ing. Can you get her to 
stop it??  This person does not want to talk with J
ohanna herself. She 
wants to avoid the reality of speaking up herself, 
and, turning her supposed 
friend Darlene into a sort of human magic wand, a m
ere prop famous 
magicians apparently use to make things happen with
out effort. 
 
Oh, we are still called to be the voices of those w
ho are disenfranchised in 
this world. The call to social justice is just that
–making the invisible 
visible, giving those literally scared speechless a
 real voice. But their 
voice, not ours.   

 
The freedom and responsibility suggested by the myt
hic moving star is still 
upon us. It cannot magically be whisked away by our
 fears about what 
people might think of us if we speak up to them. It
 cannot magically be 
defeated by the sheer number of our disappointments
 stacked against it as 
protection, or by any sense of entitlement that sti
ll dogs our tracks.   
 
David Blaine makes it clear in his reading that his
 kind of magic is NOT a 
form of magical thinking. He is not creating escape
s away from this world, 
but goes instead right into the middle of this worl
d, right to the basic 
physics of inertia. He applies the physics of inert
ia to work a wonder, 
knowing that many people don™t know that applicatio
n of inertia. And 
folks like Chris Angel deal with peoples fears abou
t death, decay and loss 
with their magic. He cuts himself in half, makes fo
lks disappear, and pulls 
threads out if his eyeball to address that almost u
niversal discomfort with 
the transience of all things. 

He even calls literalist biblical readings into que
stion by effortlessly 
walking across a swimming pool filled with people, 
a clear reference to the 
?walking on water? story preserved in the Gospels. 
Real magic is never 
about miracles, he is saying with blunt clarity. 

 10
  
And it seems to me that magicians like Blaine and A
ngel, even though 
they are clearly showmen like the great Universalis
t P.T. Barnum, are 
telling the truth about what it means to live an ho
nest spiritual life a lot 
better than those who try to convince me that this 
world is something to 
escape from, a place where I deserve to be ?left be
hind? in hellfire because 
I do not convince myself, like the late Jerry Falwe
ll did, that God speaks to 
me and tells me to dismiss most of humanity with a 
wave of my hand. 
 
What these modern magicians are telling me is that 
even though it is not 
perfect, deathless, and flawless, even thought it d
ecays and falls apart, this 
world is still the home of our spirits. They are no
t telling me I need to be 
?saved? 
from 
the world by denial, magical thinking, and escapism
. 
They are telling me the world is bright enough as i
t is. Dazzling enough 
even though it™s fragile, and tinged with decay and
 loss. In Mary Oliver™s 
lovely words: 

 
Still, what I want in my life 

is to be willing to be dazzled -- 

to cast aside the weight of facts 

  

and maybe even to float a little 

above this difficult world.  

I want to believe I am looking 

  

into the white fire of a great mystery. 

I want to believe that the imperfections are nothin
g --that the light is 
everything -- that it is more than the sum of each 
flawed blossom rising 
and fading. And I do. 

 
The mystery is here, she says, not somewhere else. 
It™s a matter of 
perspective, rising above the fears. The light IS e
verything, and it shines 
even from the flawed blossoms, and torn lily pads. 
You have only to look, 
or better, think–not magically, but honestly and cl
early and with 
gratitude. I don™t know where the sun comes from an
ymore than I know 
where that large ball which dropped out of Steve™s 
tumbler came from. 
The magic of great magicians just invites me to liv
e my own life, a life of 

 11
 joyful duty, in the here and now, doing the work, t
aking the time, thinking 
things through, paying attention the physical rules
, the inertia, the gravity, 
the honesty and the craft of living, all so that I 
can dazzle and be dazzled in 
that light.

Just like that! Poof! It™s spring! 

Were you watching closely? 

Were you fooled? 

The snowflakes changed into leaves. 

The bitter cold changed into soft green 

blades of grass, and ice changed into 

rubber-stemmed dandelions. It was a good trick, 

I think you™ll have to admit. 

Excellent craft on the part of the magician, 

whose name I suddenly have forgotten. 

Funny how that happens 

when the light gets into your eyes, 

and your amazement is so profound 

that nothing, even names, seems 

to find any room inside. 

Just like that! The service is ending! 

The ?We are here? is changing 

right before your eyes–abracadabra-- to 

a ?We are singing? and a ?We are leaving for a whil
e until poof! the choir 
appears and the concert begins. It will happen by m
agic. 
Just like that!
