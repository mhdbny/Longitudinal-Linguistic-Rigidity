  As the tide rises, the closed mollusc
  Opens a fraction to the ocean's food,
  Bathed in its riches. Do not ask
  What force would do, or if force could.
  
  A knife is of no use against a fortress.
  You might break it to pieces as gulls do.
  No, only the rising tide and its slow progress
  Opens the shell. Lovers, I tell you true.
  
  You who have held yourselves closed hard
  Against warm sun and wind, shelled up in fears
  And hostile to a touch or tender word -
  The ocean rises, salt as unshed tears.
  
  Now you are floated on this gentle flood 
  That cannot force or be forced, welcome food
  Salt as your tears, the rich ocean's blood,
  Eat, rest, be nourished on the tide of love.

  Heart of my heart, speak to me, 
  And I will turn to thee. 
  Say to me:
  Drop the rock.
  Unlatch the door.
  Loosen the knot.
  Release the robin.
  Cut the lock. 
  Tear the curtain.
  And I will listen and do so.
  
  Say to me:
  Feet on the ground.
  Eye on the horizon.
  Tear in the eye.
  Song in the mouth.
  Sun (rain) on the shoulders.
  Love in the word.
  And I will listen and do so.
  
  Say to me:
  Resist meanness still.
  Adore the springtime still.
  Live by honor still.
  Turn from hatred still.
  Run from winning and losing,
  and losing and winning,
  and be still, and be still,
  and I will, I say to thee, 
  and I will, and I will
  turn back, turn back, turn back 
  to the world and its promise of spring. amen
