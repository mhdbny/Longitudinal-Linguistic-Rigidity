 1 2007-4-22 EarthDay, 

Mark Belletini 

 
Opening 
  
We are here 

on a bright Sunday morning in spring 

to worship together;  

to reflect on our joys and struggles 

as common creatures on this blue-green earth, 

creatures related to all else, yet each unique. 

Mindful of this grace, we begin together: 

 
As we move through this year of transition and joy,
 we remember 
with gratitude the power of our living heritage, wh
ich moves 
through time like a clear running creek; refreshing
 us with the sweet 
draughts of courage, hope, justice-making, peaceful
 living, ever 
deeper honesty, and more truthful loving. And so we
 kindle this 
light in thanksgiving. 

 
Commissioning of the BREAD Team: A Litany: 
(preceded by a 
preface about  

what BREAD does and how. For the litany, apologies 
to William Safford 
for lifting a line from his perfect poem.) 

 
The world is beautiful, but its people suffer from 
systemic injustice. We 
therefore now commission you, our congregational BR
EAD Team, to 
help organize this congregation to work against the
se injustices; 
 
for it is important that awake people be awake
. 
 
There are many things which call to us in this worl
d, many obligations 
and duties, pleasures and relationships. Yet from t
ime to time, deeper 
calls make themselves known to us, and call us to a
n even sharper 
awareness, 

 
for it is important that awake people be awake
. 

 2  
Spirit of Life, sing in us as well as in those we c
ommission on our 
BREAD team, for we are all in this together. We are
 called to make any 
faithfulness to truth, love and compassion we claim
 for ourselves 
real, 
 through our ability to respond, to be responsible; 

 
for it is important that awake people be awake. 

Sequence 

 
A week of tears for many. 

Parents burying children. 

Children burying parents. 

Brutal violence once again, once again,  

tearing at the nation's heart. 

 
 The earth beneath our feet blossoms anyway, 

 squeezes alleluias, some green, some pink, 

 out of the long stretch of the branches, 

 thrusts up blue and yellow flowers just like that.
  Birds of many hues soar and dive. 

 Mosquitoes begin their spring ascension. 

 Bears brown and black lumber in the forests. 

 Bees connect everything by a slender thread 

 of golden pollen.  Frogs announce themselves. 

 But neither flower nor beast weeps for the   

 violence. 

 
Still, no one can say the earth does not weep 

because of the recent loss of life. No one can say 
the earth does not weep 
for losses in Virginia. In Baghdad. In the Vonnegut
 family. Or anyplace. 
 For this house too is the earth. 

 Its people no less a portion of the planet 

 than robins or brown bears. 

 Our tears, the very tears– of the earth. 

 Our awed silence before the alleluias of spring, 

 the very silence of the earth. 

 
 3  Silence 
 
Bowing to what joins us–love, struggle, boundaries,
 burdens, memory 
and hope, we name the men, women and children who h
ave 
deepened our lives, taught our hearts, healed our 

spirits or helped us discover who we are. Each name
 we say–in our 
heart, or aloud, is also an alleluia. 

 
 Naming 

 
Alleluia. Alhamdulila. Laudamus. Amen. 

 
 
 
 
 
Readings 

 
The First Reading comes from an essay by Nina Simon
s, who, with her 
husband, runs the Bioneers Institute, which promote
s practical 
environmental solutions and social strategies. 

(This comes from a Spring 2005 issue of Earth Light
, a magazine lent 
me by Wanda Hambrick) 

 
I want to speak with you about what lies at the hea
rt of the tough issues 
that we face, both as a culture and as a species. T
he root source of our 
gravest challenges---both socially and environmenta
lly---is a crisis of 
relationship. 

We have got to learn how to be in relationship in a
 way that is both 
enduring, and can help us heal our personal and soc
ietal wounds. 
 
How then can we enhance and accelerate our learning
 about conscious 
kinship? Because, for many centuries, the value of 
relationship has been 
vastly underrated, even scorned. It's been relegate
d to the disrespected 
world of intuition or sentimentality. Our ways of k
nowing through our 
heart have become weakened from disuse, as we™ve be
come distracted 
by an emphasis on getting more stuff. In the Cherok
ee language, there is 

 4 no word for the love of an inanimate thing–love is 
only possible 
between two sentient beings. Anyone who loves a thi
ng is considered 
insane, since such a person values belongings more 
than belonging. 
 
Fortunately, there are some encouraging signs of ch
ange on a societal 
level. The European Union is an inspiring example o
f healing 
relationships on an immense scale between peoples w
ho not so long ago 
fought the bloodiest wars in the history of our pla
net. Currently with 25 
member nations, with a population 50% larger than t
he US on a land 
mass only half the size, the E.U. is now the world'
s largest economy, 
with far less wealth inequality between rich and po
or than we have in the 
U.S.  In terms of their quality of life, 

they have more physicians per capita, longer averag
e life-spans, lower 
crime and FAR fewer 

prisoners and less violence than we do. Their annua
l vacation is more 
than double what ours is here. 

 
The two cultures have diametrically opposed ideas a
bout freedom and 
security. For Americans, freedom is associated with
 autonomy and 
independence. For many young Europeans, however, fr
eedom is now 
found in embeddedness, in having access to many int
erdependent 
relationships. The more communities one has access 
to, they believe, the 
more options one has for a full and meaningful life
. 
 
In the U.S.A. with a history of relations that have
 reinforced hierarchy, 
domination and disrespect as the norm, we have a lo
t of unlearning to 
do. But, I believe our biological orientation towar
d relationship 
strengthens our likelihood of success. So, as the L
akota people say, in 
ending every prayer, O Mitakuye Oyasin–to all our r
elations. 
 
 
 
 
The Second Reading is a short poem by the poet Fran
cisco Alarcon, 
known for his elegant relationship to the native Am
erican culture which 
roots him. It's called Home Spirit and it comes fro
m his wonderful book 
Snake Poems.

Sermon 

 
It's Earth Day today, but since, as the proverb has
 it, ?we don't see things 
the way they are, we see things the way we are,? th
ere is no way to enter 
into this talk this morning without first talking a
bout my trip to Berlin. 
For the person giving this sermon this morning, bes
ides having yet 
another fool cough from sitting on a sneeze-packed 
plane for 81/2 hours, 
is still deeply resonating in his heart with his ex
periences there. 
 
My sermon went over well for the European Unitarian
 Universalists, and 
my long lecture last Saturday on the future of the 
Unitarian Universalist 
Association during the next 50-75 years was both so
mething I am proud 
of, and something, thankfully, received very well i
ndeed. Having 
worked with these wonderful people from all over Eu
rope four times 
now, I have watched their children grow over the la
st 11 years, and find 
this repeating weekend a deep privilege of growing 
relationship in my 
life.  

 
But I also got to spend time with my best friend, R
ichard, from San 
Francisco, who used to live in Berlin back in the e
arly 80™s. He has 

 6 cultivated many friends there. We had wanted to spe
nd some quality 
time together.  So, knowing that I was going over t
o Berlin to preach, he 
wondered if we might not spend a few days together 
on either side of the 
retreat. Naturally, I thought it a wonderful idea. 

 
Berlin is an excellent example of everything Nina S
imons expressed in 
the reading you just heard. 

I traveled all over this golden, beautiful city, fr
om north to south, from 
east to west, from edge to edge, suburb to suburb, 
and never did I find 
the kind of economic neighborhood contrast (boarded
-up slum vs. 
elegant estates) that you can find in any North Ame
rican city. There 
were just–neighborhoods. In all of their variety. P
overty exists of 
course in the E.U.–it's not a utopia–but it does no
t appear to exist in 
the way it so painfully does here in our urban cent
ers. Crime and prison 
life are different in Europe too, Simons says–so I 
checked out her 
assertion. Here are the sobering facts: in the E.U.
, which has a far greater 
population than the U.S.A., the number of persons i
mprisoned per 
100,000 people is 87. In the U.S.A., it's almost 70
0 per 100,000.  And 
there are over three hundred million of us. When yo
u do the math, it 
hurts to look at the actual number of incarcerated 
Americans. This 
business about crime and prisons is a vast and dist
urbingly strange 
difference, by my lights. Chilling to the bone. Wha
t makes our cultures 
so different? 

 
Of course, in Berlin, the public transportation is 
out of sight. Subways, 
elevated trains, street cars, light-rails, trams, d
ouble-decker glass -walled 
busses–and plenty of them. And please, not just in 
the center city, all 
the way out to the farthest suburb. I never once wa
ited more than two 
minutes for a train or bus. Even at midnight. It™s 
the best transit system 
I™ve ever seen in the E.U. or anywhere else for tha
t matter, New York 
City included. Both buses and subways were unbeliev
ably quiet too, for 
reasons that were never clear to me. Very little no
ise pollution.  
Furthermore, everyone of the wide sidewalks they ha
ve there in that 
spacious city had a bike lane, which was heavily us
ed. 
 
The sense of 
embeddedness
, of deep relationships, contrasted with our 
own U.S.A. propensity for independence, which Simon
s talks about in 

 7 her essay, was also abundantly clear to me. Over se
veral nights, sitting at 
an Italian sidewalk café in Charlottenberg, a Berli
n neighborhood, or 
eating Tibetan 
momo
 in a courtyard in Schoneberg, I was captured by 
the stories of many embedded communities with deep 
roots and complex 
relations going back thirty years. A Spaniard from 
Galicia, a Mexican 
from Chiapas, a black Brazilian ex-dancer and Cando
mblé priest, a 
young urban planner from the island in the North Se
a, a retired city 
policeman, a Mexican student, a gay Kurdish Muslim,
 a Ukrainian 
father, a psychotherapist of fiery passion–all conn
ected, all, all 
Berliners, inviting me as Richard™s friend into the
ir circle of deep 
belonging and relationship. 

 
We spoke of our cultures. They admired and were sli
ghtly baffled by the 
volunteerism and do-it-yourself attitude of the U.S
.A., which springs 
from our clear understanding of freedom as ?indepen
dence and 
autonomy.?  You know, the ?We™ll do it ourselves? a
ttitude.  German 
Village, for example, here in Columbus, was largely
 refurbished and 
redone by the folks who live there. It wasn™t a hug
e imposed government 
project. Whereas the fifth floor walk-up where I st
ayed in Berlin was 
entirely redone by the German government. Its occup
ants were housed 
temporarily in another flat, and the government off
ered them designers, 
planners and psychologists to help smooth their tra
nsition. And now 
their place is retrofitted, and redesigned, and the
y had nothing much to 
do with it except to gracefully step aside and let 
it all happen. This, I 
don™t have to tell you, will not happen in the Stat
es. Ever. 
 
As they noted our do-it-yourself attitude, Richard 
and I, of course, noted 
their admirable health coverage, their total citywi
de recycling 
consciousness, their lavish vacation schedule and t
heir transportation 
system. In short, the conversations on those nights
 really underscored 
the whole gist of Nina Simons article describing a 
very significant 
cultural distinction between the U.S.A. and the E.U
. 
 
Furthermore, the sense of persons coming first, thi
ngs coming last was 
very evident to me, at least among the Berliners I 
so luckily met. 
Like the Cherokee, who have no word for the love of
 things, I had every 
sense that there was nothing on earth these Berline
rs would trade for 

 8 what they have in their belonging, their deep netwo
rk of satisfying 
relationships.  

 
Now you may understandably be wondering what the ch
ildren™s story 
about dancing bears in Ute territory could possibly
 have to do with a trip 
to Europe. Well, here I have to do a little sleight
 of hand. You see, 
Berlin, the actual word, has a meaning. It refers t
o an animal. Just as 
Columbus, besides referring to an infamous sailor, 
is also the Romance 
word for ?dove,? so Berlin is the Teutonic word for
 ?little bear.? 
 
The great forests around Berlin were once filled wi
th bears and other 
wildlife. In ancient times, these bears figured as 
much in the 
mythologies and symbol-systems of the early people 
there as they did in 
the mythologies of the native peoples here. The Eur
opeans even saw 
bears in the sky, and to this day we have Ursa Majo
r and Ursa Minor in 
the sky, although here we have come to call them th
e Big and Little 
Dipper instead of Big Bear and Little Bear. The Nat
ives here, of many 
nations, also related spiritually to the bear, espe
cially as a symbol of 
dreams, since bears are famous for their long winte
r naps, their 
hibernation, as in the story this morning. 

 
Many of the Europeans are interested in their old n
ative religions and 
myths just as many modern North Americans are inter
ested in the stories 
and symbols that originated here. The Finns, Lithua
nians and the 
Estonians in particular have re-created ancient rel
igious practices and 
rituals, sometimes based as much on bear lore or ot
her animal lore as the 
Natives here. 

 
Certainly the Natives of this land had a rich relig
ious life. It was quite 
varied from nation to nation, and the religion of t
he Hopi has as much to 
do with the religion of the Cherokee as Quakerism h
as to do with 
Brazilian Candomblé, 
at least on the surface.
 They were very different 
in ritual and imagery, those spiritualities.  

 
As I have affirmed before, I find that these native
 religious practices and 
theologies are often misunderstood, and worse, misr
epresented, and 
lifted up on days like Earth Day as forms of simple
 earth-centered 

 9 devotion. They are lifted up as a collection of sor
t of pre-ecological 
spiritualities.  

 
This is something of a romantic distortion, and ver
y unfair to the dignity 
of the Natives, whose religions were complex, deepl
y theological and 
very rich. This distortion is typical, I have to ad
d, as it™s hard to find, in 
all of American history, an example of a single tre
aty; made by the 
natives with the colonists, which was kept by the c
olonists. Treating the 
Natives with contempt has been a blot on the Americ
an spirit for 
centuries.  

 
As I understand it, the Natives, of whatever nation
, did not reverence the 
earth as a medieval European might reverence a sain
t or the Virgin. The 
bears and wolves were not reverenced as angels of a
 different order, but 
rather, they proclaimed that all living creatures w
ere our relations, our 
sisters and brothers. Thus, though the religious fo
rms were diverse, there 
was a single theme that tied the religious expressi
ons of peoples as 
diverse as the Hopi and the Cherokee. This was the 
affirmation of reality 
as entirely relational. All beings are our relative
s. We are all one whole, 
entirely interdependent, not independent. The Nativ
e world was filled 
not just with sisters and brothers, but mothers and
 fathers too. Even the 
great Mystery which bound all creatures together as
 one–.
orenda
 in one 
language, 
wakan tanka
 in another, 
manitou
 in a third,– was often 
addressed with a relational title,-"grandfather.?  
(Never ?grandmother? 
as far as I can tell. Remember, the Natives were ju
st as patriarchal in 
practice as the European colonists were. In this th
ey shared much in 
common with the people who invaded their lands. )  

 
Now please. This idea of the relationality of all t
hings, the familyhood of 
all creatures, was 
not
 absent from Western Religion, although there are 
some who would like us to accept that statement on 
faith. I admit this 
stance was often suppressed, but it was there. Some
 of you know that the 
earliest poem ever written in a modern romance lang
uage, namely local 
Italian, as opposed to the universal Latin, was wri
tten by the great 
Christian revolutionary Giovanni Bernardone, whom w
e call by his 
nickname ?Frenchy? (Francesco, or Francis, of Assis
i). He called even 
the sun and moon ?brother and sister,? and he preac
hed to the birds and 

 10
 the wolves as creatures worthy of hearing a message
 of love. He 
understood his ancient religion in a most relationa
l way, in a way quite 
parallel to the Natives on this continent. 

 
This idea that all creatures are members of our fam
ily, or that all of us 
together are the earth, is economically expressed i
n Francisco Alarcon™s 
sweet, sharp poem.  

 
you lock  

windows,  

doors-- 

But I'm  

inside you;  

am
 you.
  
 
What is it that announces that it is inside me? The
 earth. I am the earth. 
You are the earth. The earth is not ?nature,? as if
 nature was only green 
things and wilderness, and Berlin and Columbus are 
no longer part of 
nature. Everything on earth is nature. Even this bu
ilding we have built 
with sharp edges and clear glass rarely found in th
e wilderness. The 
earth 
is
 the beams above our head, the woven carpet, the fo
undation, the 
plants, the painting, the words in the air between 
us, the hearts beating 
within us. All of this, right now, is part of the b
lue green hills of earth. 
All one whole. No one is any more of the earth than
 anyone–or 
anything–else. 

 
But what are the doors we lock, according to Alarco
n? The windows we 
slam shut? 

 
To say that belonging is not as important as belong
ing slams the door. 
To insist that one person is worthy, and another pe
rson is not, shuts the 
window. The cruel, nasty words we have invented to 
damn each other by 
race, color, religion, gender, orientation, culture
 etc. are slammed 
windows and shut doors. The death of all those peop
le in Virginia 
weighs heavily on me. I can™t help but think of par
ents burying children, 
the hardest thought to ever hold in the heart. But 
at the same time, I was 
so haunted by reading about this sad young Korean A
merican man who 

 11
 killed so many at Virginia Tech. How when this fell
ow had some 
problems speaking in a classroom one day, his class
mates shouted at 
him with a mocking laugh,?Go back to China!?   

 
Door slammed. Window locked. 

 
Mental illness and crime are far more rampant in th
e U.S.A. than in the 
E.U. Why? Can it be that such easy phrases as 
Go back to China
, or the 
damnable language of that radio fool Don Imus, are 
routinely defended 
as ?freedom of expression"? A freedom that, as Nina
 Simons says, is 
more about autonomy and independence than belonging
, or 
relationality? ?I can say what I want. Don™t you ta
ke away my freedom!? 
 
Don™t get me wrong. Just as I don™t want to romanti
cize the Native 
theologies around the earth, I don™t want to romant
icize the idea of 
Native theologies around relationship– O Mitakuye O
yasin–to all our 
relations, in Lakota. Because, just as we have diff
erent relationships with 
members of our family, so we will have different re
lationships with 
members of our larger earth family. Berlin was goin
g crazy, when I was 
there, about this polar bear, Knut, which had been 
born at the zoo there. 
Cute as can be, that little white bear. Could melt 
your heart with one 
glance. But not all bears are the same, even if all
 of them are our 
relatives. Best not to coo and melt, for example, w
hen a hungry grizzly 
is in your path. You could be a goner just like tha
t. 
 
So, yes, even when all things are related, you have
 to use some sense, set 
boundaries, relate honestly, not in a fool-hearted 
way. But you know, 
bears have a strange reputation among most modern c
ity dwellers. They 
can kill you, yes, but almost never do. Folks seem 
to think of them as 
fierce beasts–you know, ?lions and tigers and bears
, oh my!? from the 
Wizard of Oz. But in truth, they™re loners, and thi
nk human beings smell 
bad, and run away from us. Except in National Parks
, when the bad 
smell of humans is merely a sign that good-smelling
 garbage is near by. 
And you are 90,000 times, according to one statisti
c I read in a book 
about bears, more likely to be killed by a fellow h
uman being than by a 
bear. 

 
 12
 I am glad to be back home. I love Columbus and this
 congregation and 
the family I have created here. But I have to say, 
I felt very much at 
home in Berlin too. And maybe, finally, that is wha
t is going to have to 
happen if the human race is to survive the mess we 
have made of the 
earth–learn to see all creatures as our relatives. 
Learn to see all places 
as our home, our only home, our holy home, the blue
 green hills of 
earth. 

 
Earth Prayer 

 
 I am part of you, great planet 

 Along with each blade of grass, 

 each garden snake, each robin, each iris. 

 I am part of you, along with dancing bears 

 in a children™s story, or a deep conversation 

 in a foreign land. I am part of you. You are 

 in me. And in everyone. And we are the earth, 

 and for the earth, we sing.
