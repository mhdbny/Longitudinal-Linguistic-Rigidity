Opening Words
 
 
We are here
,
 
as a community seventy years in the making
,
 
to worship, to tend the roots that nourish us,
 
that we might blossom in due season
,
 
with greater love, justice and faithfu
lness.
 
 
And so, we pledge to journey together along the ways of truth and 
affection, as best as we can name them now, or may learn them in 
days to come; that we and our children may be fulfilled, and that we 
may speak to our world in words and lives of pea
ce, justice and 
goodwill.

is itself a sacred icon in time,

bright even now when the days are shorter, reflecting back to us the light of our 
astonishment.

The First Reading
 
is taken from a recent email I received from Rev. Joel Miller. Joel 
grew up in this church, and is now the minister at our Buffalo congregation. He was also 
one of my best interns at my former congregation in Hayward California. So I have 
known Joel a lon

history, so I asked him to write it out for me.
 
 
I can't remember who we had make that first chalice. It was thrown of clay, glazed to 
look
 
bronze to coordinate with the other decoration
s in the Sanctuary at the time. What I 
do recal
l is the meeting that previous w
inter when I first asked to light the chalice.
 
 

but
 
this had not happened ever in the S
unday morning adult worship. I had asked a 
Sunday School teacher about it once, and he explained that the adults didn't light a 
chalice because Unitarians didn't have "dogmas".... I was 10 years old, and I wondered 
what dogs had to
 
do wi
th lighting anythin
g on fire.  Twelve
 
years later, after I had 
become the Chair of the Worship Committee, I proposed to the Worship
 
Committee that 
we light a chalice at the beginning of worship. I remember one man telling me that he 
thought that lighting a
 


 
I remember looking at him in utter 
confusion. I had no clue what that little bag of perfumed flowers my mother had in
 
her guest bathroom had to do with lighting a chalice. 
 

to do with lighting a chalice, the man began
 

would do. I was confused since I thought he was
 
telling me that Catholics also lit a 
Flaming Chalice, while the rest of the committee was having a great laugh. By the end of 
all that
 
confusion, the committee vote
d to try the chalice lighting for a while.
 
 
There were so
me strong comments that Sunday m
orning, and I had several intense 
conversations in which I explained that lighting a chalice was
 
something I wanted to do 
and that I had sought the approval of the Wor
ship Committee. I can't remember the name 
of the one guy who seemed
 
most upset by it, but since no one could give me a rational 
reason 
--
or really, even an irrational reason 
--
 
why having symbol was a bad
 
thing, I kept 
on lobbying for what I wanted. I lit 
the chalice on a few following Sundays, and so did 
Nancy Lee. After that, I don't recall hearing much more about it.
 
 
I also bought the bell rung at the beginning of the service. The Worship Committee asked 
me to during my first year at Starr King School. 
I went to San Francisco and found it in a 
Buddhist bookstore and mailed it back to Columbus. I heard that the letter I wrote that 
accompanied it was read aloud at its first ringing.
 

 
The Second Reading
 
consists of a few lines from An Atlas of the Difficult 
World, a much 
longer poem, by the great American poet, Adrienne Rich
.
 
 
Here is a map of our country:
 
This is the desert where missiles are planted  
 
This is the breadbasket of foreclosed farms
 
This is the birthplace of the rockabilly boy
 
This is the cemete
ry of the poor
 
who died for democracy     
 
This is a battlefield

Sermon
 
 
When I fi
rst moved here to Columbus, it was a different city. There are many new 
highway inter
-
changes now, more lanes down 315, fresh crystal buildings like the 
Courthouse; and my loft building is now just one of many such buildings downtown. Our 

-
cr
eam is famous around the country; our zoo and our libraries and our 

you can now find restaurants serving the foods of Zanzibar, Senegal, Ghana, Bali, 
Vietnam, Ecuador, Somali
a and Thailand; and at least ten new Asian Markets, and shops 
that sell Halal meats. The Short North, once a neighborhood of terror and toughness, is 
now a destination
.
 
 

e 
to get around, charming with brick streets and domestic neighborhoods shaded with trees;
 
a safer center for diverse sexualities, an urban haven for artists and dancers, a culture 
anchored by the many universities, colleges and even seminaries that thicke
n on the 
landscape. There are still no trains connecting us to other great Ohio cities. There is no 

 
light
-
rail and no signs of any light
-
rail coming. But, fool that I am, I have hopes that 
some day even 
that
 
will change. 
 
 
Things in Columbus have changed d
rastically. 
 
Faster, or slower. But clearly. 
 
However, 
other factors cannot so much be said to have changed drastically, as deepened, or become 
more layered, and nuanced.
 
 
Columbus has changed over the last seventy years a lot more than in the last decade.
 
The
 

street car tracks were taken up and replaced by busses. The city has weathered loss of 
industry, the economic effect of horrific and often controversial wars in Europe and
 
Asia 
and the Middle East. City and state government centers have sponsored hundreds of 
elections in the last seventy years too, with contrasting results, welcomed by either 
despondency or smugness. The single skyscraper in 1940, the LeVeque tower, is now 
just 
a gnarled old tree in a forest of sleeker young growth.  
 
 
Somehow, despite all of these changes, it

s been Columbus Ohio and its surrounding 
suburbs the whole time. 
 
 
And remember, Columbus and its suburbs has been a city 
in America
 
for 70 years. 
Adr
ienne Rich tells us something about that larger context too: 
Here is a map of our 
country
, she writes: 
 
 
This is the desert where missiles are planted  
 
This is the breadbasket of foreclosed farms
 
This is the cemetery of the poor
 
who died for democracy    
 
 

 
hourly wages and no shares
 
There are other battlefields  Centralia Detroit
 
here are the forests primeval  
 
the copper the silver lodes
 

 
 

 
of them in recent newspapers, 

foreclosure, missiles, the poor, hourly wages and no shares.
 
What I am 
trying to say is that this congregation exists in time as well as in space. Space is signed by 
differing buildings. But our church exists al
so in time; and not just in time, but in 
the 
times
; in other words, it is set in the various larger cultural movements weaving through 
its own seven decades.

this congregation has changed.
 
From the 30 or so who gathered in the house to the 400 or 

 
 

than Rod Serling for example, even tho
ugh he was just as much a member here as many 
of you. Rod Serling was a member of this congregation in the days when Jack Hayward 
was minister. Back then, there was no flaming chalice lit at the beginning of the service. 

ey hymnbook nor the blue hymnbook had been created 
yet. Ministers wore dark suits or black gowns. Colorful stoles had yet to be incorporated 
into our style. And though the sermons in those days dealt with love and justice just as 
our present ones do, the s
ermons intersected with the culture of 
those
 
days, not ours. For 
example, in the words of Rod Serling we read this morning at the time of the Affirmation, 
he writes of 
young and old
 
joining hands to 
build bridges. Why? 
Because of the college 
student protes
ts and their disgusted, disgruntled parents, a event that dominated the 
sixties when he wrote. He also wrote the following amazing words:
 


Those words directly refer to 
a the
ological movement in the sixties
,
 
touted by Gabriel Vahanian, William Hamilton and 
Thomas Altizer. Time Magazine ran a very famous cover story titled 
Is God Dead?
 
addressing this theological movement just a short time before Serling wrote those words. 
So S
erling was, in short, a man of his time. He was pre
-
kindle, pre
-
computer, pre
-
cell 
phone, pre
-
Fox News and MSNBC. And yet, he was part of this church, and after this 
church, a member of three other Unitarian Universalist congregations on the co
asts where 
h
e filmed his TV show
s or wrote his famous teleplays. 
 
 
Yet just ten years before he joined this particular congregation, the whole idea of a 
teleplay or a television show was unheard of. No one thought there would vast networks, 
or imagined weekly animatio
n like Flintstones. Yet they came, those networks; we saw, 
and they conquered. And in 1940, when our church was first gathered, when Woody 
Guthrie wrote 
This Land is Your Land,
 
and Dr. Seuss wrote 
Horton Hatches an Egg
, no 
one was thinking about atomic bom
bs, either, or moon landings, or same
-
gender 
marriage. And no one back then thought that the word 
man
 
meant anything less than all 
humankind, no matter what gender. And our hymnbooks were packed to the edge with 
male pronouns only.
 
 
When Joel Miller was gr
owing up in this church,
 
he grew up in the older part of the 
building. This new Center was not built when he was a child.
 
And when he was very 


used until the late sixties, early seventies, and not until the mid
-
eighties in many places. There was resistance to it.
 
After all, it was new. I under
stand 
that.
 
 
The symbol had a remarkable history, but no one knew it, and no one taught it.
 
 
Still, the k
ids thought that worship always began with such an act; and Joel, when he 
grew up, wanted to introduce this simple ritual to the adults.
 
 

 
His story, as you heard it in the first reading
 
is a little masterpiece of misunderstandings,
 
a series of innocent con
fusions. He thinks that dogma has to do with do
gs and is 
confused. He thinks that Catholics have a ritual of lighting a chalice and is confused by 

potpourri,
 
and Joel
 
expresses honest bewilderment that a bowl of dried flower petals has 
anything to do with any of this. All of these misunderstandings served the cause of 
laughter, and laughter o
ften lightens the load, so the W
orship 
C
ommittee g
a
ve Joel their 
blessing to l
ight the chalice, and so it has been ever since.
 
 
Now I would hope that at least some of you may be surprised that someone who was a 

first coined in the violent days of Elizabe
th
 
I
 
of England, and which gained popular
ity 
during the age of James I and the Guy Faw
kes rebellion. But remember, a congregation is 
not an island separated out from the world, but a place where the members have to 
deliberately work hard 
not
 
to be tainted 
and distorted by the biases of the larger society. 
Arthur Schlesinger Sr. who taught at OSU (and whose son Arthur Schlesinger
,
 
Jr
.
 
was 
not only a Unitarian, but the great historian 
of Liberalism in the 1960
s)
,
 
once famously 

istory of the American people is anti
-

and much of that is actually rooted in the upbringing of English colonists raised in 
Jacobean times. 
 
 

all,
 
signing the membership book at a Unitarian Universalist congregation is not a magic 
trick that turns us, presto
-
change
-
o, into perfected saints. No, claiming to be Unitarian 
Universalist means you are committing yourself to walking a path toward deeper 
aw
areness of self and world. You are promising to struggle to be faithful to our ideals 
proclaiming the inherent worth of every single person. To be a Unitarian Universalist is 
to struggle to make sure those ideals are not inadvertently tainted with the crue
lties and 
corruptions of a world where unconscious bias, systems of oppression, entitled greed and 
free ridicule have risen to high honor in many places, as many of the recent election ads 
made clear to me at least. As Adrienne Rich warns us in her poem: I

great mural of American l

baskets, the forest primeval, 
the copper and riches, as well as the joblessness, the wars, Centralia, where a burning 
mine scorched the earth around i
t, Detroit, where a city burn
ed 
(and I was a witness to 

,
 
the mural of America I have offered you, she says, 

,
 
and not so good
,
 
images of our nation and its 
eras. But, she adds, the real question is
: 
 
where do 
we
 
s
ee it from?   
 
 
Are we seeing it from the vantage of pessimism and hopelessness? Do we see through 

  


of patriotic love? Are we cynical or even bitter? Critical of people 
who are cynical and 
bitter? Are our eyes veined with fear? How do we see the present era? And do we think 
we are seeing these things entirely differently fro
m Americans alive during the 40
s?
 
 
The 
70s? 
 
The 90s? 
 
 

 
Same thing holds true for our seven
 
decades
 
of congregational history. As I see it, things 
have changed a lot in buildings, in size, in music,
 
in rituals, in metaphors, language
,
 
and 
in organization. Those things, however, are incidentals compared to our faithfulness to 
core principles. When I look
 
at our history, I think we have remained pretty steady in our 
faithfulness to principle. As faithful as Horton in our story this morning. I 
think that when 
the man on the Worship C
ommittee was saying what he did, however reactionary, he was 
trying, clumsi
ly, to make sure we were not just toying around with religion by borrowing 
without thinking, or doing rituals by habit
,
 
instead of with thoughtfulness.
  
He wanted to 

  
Ralph Waldo 
Emerson lef
t the Unitarian ministry for that principle; so although I admit that the word 


 
 
In fact, asking that question is central to our 
practice. It

s one of our main taproots. But 
it

s not more central to our chosen way of life than 
questioning ourselves, questioning 
ourselves
 
about how much we are just echoing, mindlessly, the culture around us
,
 
for 
good or ill. 
 
Faithfulnes
s to ideals i
s not the only tap
root. Without this second practice of 
working to 
undo 
the negative effects of bad culture on our spirits over the last seventy 

only 
sitting in the rubble of 
our own making.
 
 

,
 
by our faithfulness, and by our self
-
questioning, we might, 
like Horton in the story this morning, hatch something new that the world has never seen 
before. By being 100% faithful both to self
-
questioning, 
a
nd
 
to our great ideals of reason, 

a tree of life the world has never seen before. A tree offering shelter in storms, beauty to 
the eye, the fruit of many cultures a
nd classes for the nourishment of our spirits and for 
the healing of self and the world. 
 
 

Columbus. And its nation and its world. Roots, hold me close. May all that grow
s out of 
you, and up from you
,
 
serve to make us deeper and wiser and more whole through the 
years to come.
 
 
Offering
 
 
No community exists without gifts. What gift can we bring? Our presence. Our humility. 
Our teachableness. Our self
-
questioning. Our riskin
g. Our hope. Our ideals. Our 
conversations. Our faithfulness. Our financial support, either given in more modern ways 
behind the scenes, or offered in this more ancient way as an integral part of our 
celebration. The ushers are invited forward.
 
 
Meditation
 
adapted from the Jain tradition of Chitrabhanu
 
 
Let there be deep wisdom
 
Let there be deep patience
 

 
May we learn from the trees
,
 
which shed their leaves each fall
,
 
a catharsis, a fasting, a cleansing
,
 
making room for the inevitable new life.
 
the new life 
that radiates up from the roots,
 
alive with life and heat
,
 
 
even when the ground is cold.
 
Let there be a fall in every season of our lives.
 
Let thoughts that no longer serve life
 
drop away like dry leaves.
 
May we be open, receptive, expectant.
 
Let there be
 
deep wisdom.
 
Let there be deep patience.
