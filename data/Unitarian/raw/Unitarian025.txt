"On Prayer"

  You ask me how to pray to someone who is not.
  All I know is that prayer constructs a velvet bridge
  And walking it, we are aloft, as on a springboard, above landscapes the color
  of bright gold transformed by a magic stopping of the sun.
  That bridge leads to the shore of Reversal
  where everything is just the opposite and the word is unveils a meaning we
  hardly envisioned.
  Notice: I say we; there, everyone, separately,
  Feels compassion for others entangled in the flesh and knows that if there
  is no other shore
  we will walk that aerial bridge all the same.

"Of Prayer"

  Straining the dark for some answer,
  calling the strange dancer with our formal prayers, hoping for a private
  sign, a secret world of grace.
  We never meet your face, Prince of the Imagination;
  Not to our prayers have you been merciful.
  Always the human faces open their eyes behind our lids and all our questions
  become human questions.
  So when we seek we do not find you.
  And you offer no suggestions.
  
  But in that hour least expected
  when we are most ourselves and not deflected
  even by remembrance of your name,
  we stream down the paths of grace -
  Hour of the poem, or that hour
  when two people war to the bone
  and meet each other's skeleton.
  Here desire is a tremendous flower;
  Petals have steel in their growing,
  Balance-in-power as the pillar
  that supports arched leaves of stone.
  
  It is a mistake, perhaps, to believe
  that religion concerns you at all;
  that is our own invention,
  longing for formal acceptance
  to a formal invitation.
  But yours is to be the anarchist,
  the thrust of growth,
  and to be present only in the
  prayer that is creation,
  in the life that is lived. Prayer is
  love planted deeper than emotion,
  Pure Idea that cannot break apart,
  Creator of children, or the work of art.
