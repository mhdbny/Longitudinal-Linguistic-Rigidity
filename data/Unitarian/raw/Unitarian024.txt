  Of a young Boy looking out the classroom window, the Teacher asked:
  "And what do you see out there?"
  Jerked abruptly out of his reverie, all the Boy could think was to say
  "The Horizon."
  Instead of scolding the Boy for daydreaming, the Teacher asked:
  "Have you ever walked up to the Horizon?"
  The Boy thought for a moment, and then said:
  "No, I am too young."
  "Well, someday you will," the Teacher assured her pupil.
  At once the boy was interested, and he asked, "And when I get there, what
  will I find?
  "When you get there, you will discover another horizon?far beyond."
  Then the Boy said, "And if I walk again?"
  "If you walk again," the Teacher said, "you will know that the second Horizon
  is merely a starting place toward the third.
  Disappointed and disenchanted, the Boy asked, "Will my life then be one of
  always losing Horizons?"
  "No," said the Teacher, "of always finding them."

Reasons to Meditate

  to practice noticing
  to understand simple things
  to give myself clarity
  to face inevitable difficulties
  to make a conscious choice
  to welcome my feelings
  to know pain
  to experience the bliss of effort
  to take gentle possession of my mind
  to free my mind
  to be aware of my sensitivities
  to dip below superficiality
  to brighten my eyes
  to forget how I look
  to stop moving
  to let myself be how I am
  to love deeply
  to risk being myself
  to sit upright, like a pyramid
  to stay still
  to breathe in the air
  to encourage a positive habit
  to behave in the manner of one who woke up
  to pursue freedom
  to touch the ground
  to learn without words
  to unlock my heart
  to go beyond
