Opening
  
We are here 

to celebrate life with freedom, 

and to wrestle with the truths of our world 

that we might grow wiser,  

and dare to struggle for peace exactly as much 

as we imagine it. And so, we begin our worship: 

 
As we move through this year of transition and joy,
 we remember 
with gratitude the power of our living heritage, wh
ich moves 
through time like a clear running creek; 

refreshing us with the sweet draughts of courage, h
ope, justice-
making, peaceful living, ever deeper honesty, and m
ore truthful 
loving. And so we kindle this light in thanksgiving
. 
 The
 Sequence
  
Let™s play a game for a while, you and I. 

Let™s close our eyes, and imagine what the world ar
ound us would look 
like if war stopped 

and peace began. 

Not just that war overseas, but the wars here too, 

wars between those who know they are right 

and smirk,  

and those who know they are right 

and roll their eyes. 

 
I didn™t tell you it would be an easy game, 

now, did I? 

 
If war really stopped, 

a lot of other things would probably  

have to stop too–
 not only wouldn™t we see so many funerals 

 2 for young men and women, 

with all the wailing and red, red eyes, 

circling in mothers and fathers and friends, 

but we wouldn™t see hungry people in line  

at Faith Mission anymore, or people begging 

not just for spare change, but just for a chance to
 be visible. 
We would give up a lot, I suppose; 

some pride, sure; 

but also the joy of being cynical,  

or the strategy of hiding under a security blanket 
of mere shame or 
denial. 

We would have to live out in the open a lot more, u
nlocking the doors to 
our most 

vulnerable heart.  

We™d probably have to give up cringing  

for good. 

The words ?them? and ?us? might have to go on vacat
ion for a while (at 
least when they occur in the same sentence).  

And we might have to make friendships,  

not because we share a common enemy,  

but because we actually want to get to know people 
who are actually 
different from us. 

 
It™s a tough game, imagining the end of war, isn™t 
it? Yet it™s one of the 
best games I know. 

And now the silence is almost here,  

so the game™s over for a time.  

But, I pray, just a short time–.         silence 

 
Peace to all in our lives. Those we love, those 

we find hard to love, those we miss, those we 

long for. We say their names in peace, aloud or qui
etly inside us, so that 
the peace with which we would embrace them has a re
al beginning–
  
naming 

 
 3 Music is the joyous game which silence plays with s
ound, which heart 
plays with word. It too is difficult; but like most
 things difficult, it is also 
beautiful.  

 
The First Reading is in two parts. The first part c
omes from the Scroll of 
Sh™muel, called the Books of Samuel in the English 
Bible. These tales, 
although based on saga, both oral and written that 
go back centuries, 
were finally put down in the written, form we have,
 around the same 
time as the Torah, namely, about 500 years before t
he beginning of our 
era. 

 
All of the elders of Israel came together at Ramah,
 and there they said to 
the prophet Sh™muel, ?You are very old now, and you
r children are not 
following your path. So we want you to appoint a ki
ng for us, a king just 
like all the other nations have.? 

 
This request irked Sh™muel. So, after going to the 
Eternal in prayer, he 
warned them against their request in this way: ?So,
 you want a king. Let 
me tell you how kings do business. First, they take
 away your sons to be 
warriors and charioteers. Some he will make into of
ficers over fifty or a 
thousand. Others he will use to farm 
his 
fields, reap 
his
 harvest, and 
make weapons and other equipment for 
his
 battles. Then, the king will 
take your daughters for cooks and bakers, and to de
sign perfumes for his 
concubines. Then he will tax you to get ten-per cen
t of your choicest 
fields, which he will give to those who flatter him
. He will take a tenth 
part of your wine and grain, and hand it all over t
o those who court his 
good will. He will take your servants away from you
 and make them his 
own. In other words, I am telling you that a day is
 going to come when 
you will cry out in pain because of this king you h
ave elected, and on 
that day, the Eternal is not going to care one whit
, because you brought 
it on yourselves.? 

 
But the people would not listen to Sh™muel™s warnin
g. ?No,? they said, 
?we want a king over us, so we can be just like the
 other nations. Let our 
king rule over us, and lead us into his battles.?  

 
 4 And the second part of the first reading comes from
 the Gospel of 
Matthew (c. 85), a short phrase which no peer-revie
wed scholar doubts 
actually goes back to the historical Jesus himself,
 thus the Latin 
technical phrase Ipsissima Verba Iesu. 

 
Love your enemies
. 
 
 
The Second Reading comes from the book 

Continuities in Cultural Evolution
 (1964) written by the famed 
anthropologist, Margaret Mead. 

 
Our human situation no longer permits us to make ar
med dichotomies 
between those who are good and those who are evil, 
those who are right, 
and those who are wrong. The first blow dealt to ou
r enemies™ children 
will sign the death warrant of our own. 

 
 
 
Sermon
  
One of my roommates in seminary, Roger, was raised 
in a Unitarian 
Universalist congregation. He was given a good reli
gious education, 
certainly, but reading the Bible from cover to cove
r was not part of that 
education. Oh, he knew about Noah and Jesus and Mos
es, but just the 
big stories–the ark, the manger, the plagues. 

 
I, on the other hand, was not raised in a Unitarian
 Universalist 
congregation. So I had a very different kind of rel
igious education. I had 
to read the whole Bible from cover to cover several
 times–every begat, 
every psalm, every word in the gospels and the lett
ers of Paul. 
 
So one day, close to the beginning of the semester,
 Roger came back to 
our apartment to tell me about this class he was ta
king with the great 
Robert Bellah over at the University of California,
 with which we had 
cross-registration. 

 
 5  ?It's a course in Western Classics. We are going  
 to read Dante™s 
Inferno
, Augustine™s 
Confessions,
 the 
Canterbury Tales
 of Chaucer, and 
the 
Gospel of Matthew.?
  
 ?We had to read all those things in high school,? 
I said. ?But I would 
have to read them over again, 'cause I don™t rememb
er much about them. 
But, since I heard the gospel of Matthew over and o
ver again in church, 
I practically have that memorized. I wouldn't have 
to re-read that again 
at all.? 

 
 ?I've never read it,? said Roger, plainly. 

 
 ?Really??  I was genuinely surprised. ?Well,? I sa
id, ?I know a lot about 
it, so if you get confused about what you are readi
ng, I might be able to 
help you figure it out.? 

 
 ?Deal,? said Roger. 

 
 Later that month, Roger was in his room studying. 
Steady, serene 
Roger, a very good student. Suddenly I heard him cr
y out ?I didn't know 
he said that!?  And then, ?I can't believe it! How 
can it be that I never 
heard that he said that?? 

 
 I was surprised to hear Roger expressing himself d
ramatically, since 
that was usually my department. 

 
 ?Roger, what's going on? Are you having a nervous 
breakdown or 
something?? 

 
 ?No, I am just surprised that Jesus said all this 
stuff. I mean, it's pure 
Gandhi. Non-violence, anti-war and all that. 'Love 
your enemies!' he 
said. I am just astounded.? 

 
 Roger, you see, had been a conscientious objector 
during the Vietnam 
War era. He had received a very high number during 
the first draft 
lottery (remember that awful day?) and really didn'
t ?have? to pursue 
CO status. But he insisted on getting it anyway, be
cause for him, this 

 6 refusing to kill approach wasn't just a matter of l
uck, a mere lottery–it 
was a matter of deep religious principle. He simply
 did not believe in 
killing other human beings. For any reason. And eve
n though the 
Unitarian Universalist Association is not one of th
e historic Peace 
Churches under U.S. Law, like the Society of Friend
s, or Quakers, and 
the Mennonites, he was granted CO status partially 
because he was so 
articulate about how he had made Gandhi's spiritual
 philosophy and A.J. 
Muste's pacifist philosophy his own.  And Roger alw
ays demonstrated 
that he took this non-violent way of life seriously
. I mean, he was tested 
many, many times. And he always passed the tests wi
th flying colors. 
Roger wouldn™t ever claim to be the new Gandhi, but
 he would certainly 
tell you how much living by Gandhi™s principles mad
e a difference to 
him. 

 
Roger was raised Unitarian Universalist. William Ho
ward Taft, both 
President of the United States and a Supreme Court 
Justice, was also 
raised Unitarian, before, that is, the 1963 consoli
dation of the Unitarians 
and Universalists. He was active in his home congre
gation in Cincinnati, 
Ohio when he was a young man. Very active. And he w
as active later, 
when he returned to Cincinnati to be a circuit cour
t judge after living in 
Washington D.C. for a while. In D.C., he attended A
ll Souls Unitarian 
Church, which is still a very influential congregat
ion in that august city. 
When he was President, and also a Supreme Court Jud
ge, he attended 
church there regularly. It was the minister at All 
Souls who eventually 
did his funeral. (During his election process, by t
he way, he got a lot of 
flack for being a Unitarian, from the religious rig
ht of his day.) 
 
When what we call the First World War was brewing a
nd beginning, 
President Wilson was all for American participation
 in that war. So was 
William Howard Taft, even though Wilson had soundly
 defeated him in 
the last election. At the time, Taft was the Modera
tor of the American 
Unitarian Association, what we might call today ?th
e Board Chair.? He 
was also a very articulate Unitarian, theologically
. He totally supported 
the war, and based that support on his understandin
g of Unitarian 
principles. He proposed a resolution at the General
 Conference (what we 
now call a General Assembly). In it, he asked Unita
rians nationwide to 
support President Wilson's war efforts. 

 7  
The Rev. John Haynes Holmes was minister at Communi
ty Church 
(Church of the Messiah, it was called back then) in
 New York City, 
which was a Unitarian Church. Holmes was also artic
ulate theologically. 
He was very focused on social justice, and during h
is ministry he helped 
to found the ACLU (the American Civil Liberties Uni
on), the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (
NAACP) and the 
Fellowship of Reconciliation. His understanding of 
Unitarian principles 
led him to a pacifist position about that first Gre
at War and yes, any war 
for any reason whatsoever. He wanted to have the Ge
neral Conference 
where Taft was Moderator pass a resolution for reco
nciliation and peace. 
He was soundly defeated, and Taft™s resolution won 
the day handily.  
 
Holmes was discouraged, and resigned his membership
 in the Unitarian 
Ministers' Association, and even wanted to stop cal
ling his church a 
Unitarian church. Holmes™ congregation was loyal to
 him and supported 
him in his decision to leave the Unitarian minister
ial association. Sadly, 
almost all the other pacifist Unitarian ministers w
ho shared Holmes™ 
convictions were let go by their congregations, who
 all tended to be in 
support of the war. Holmes would eventually allow h
imself to be listed 
as a Unitarian minister again, but he never regrett
ed that he resigned his 
membership for a goodly number of years. 

 
Some years later, during the Vietnam War, many of o
ur ministers came 
out against that war. John Evans, who served both t
his church and my 
former congregation during that era, was soundly ag
ainst that war from 
the very beginning. But things had changed among Un
itarians, and now, 
the Unitarian Universalists. Many congregations wer
e filled with people 
who criticized the Vietnam war without ceasing, lea
ding marches and 
attending protests. But there were still many among
 us who felt that the 
ministers and congregations went too far, and who r
esigned their 
membership just over this issue.  

 
The present war in Iraq has been largely condemned 
by what seems to 
me to be the majority of Unitarian Universalists ac
ross the nation, 
including those who have grown children serving in 
that war. But even 
though that™s true, there are still folks who feel 
that there might be some 

 8 moral good that could come out of it yet, and who a
re uncomfortable 
with the basic anti-war sentiment found in our cong
regations. 
 
So this morning I want to explore the religious gro
undings of such vastly 
different attitudes. I did a lot of reading this we
ek on this subject, and 
believe me, I am convinced that the whole history o
f religion™s 
association with both war and peace 
throughout the world
 and 
throughout all of human history
 has always been simply a larger version 
of the Unitarian conflict I described between Taft 
and Holmes. 
 
The Qu™ran, the holy book of the Muslims, talks abo
ut 
jihad
, a word 
which means 
striving
, and 
yes, war-like people interpret the word 
striving
 as 
warfare
; but peace-
loving Muslims, like the Sufis and the Mazziyariya 
community, 
interpreted the very same passages in a pacifist wa
y. 
 
The New Testament records the authentic words of Je
sus as ?Love your 
enemies.?  Inspired by this very clear ethic, the e
arliest Christians were 
strict pacifists, and were thrown to the lions for 
that more than anything 
else, to wit, refusing to go to war at the behest o
f Caesar. That all 
changed once the church married the state in the da
ys of Constantine. 
Still, even though this church/state union was a ca
lamity, many were the 
Christian bodies which resisted the tide of church 
blest warfare. The 
Mennonites, the Amish, our own ancestors, the Socin
ians of Poland and 
Lithuania, the Quakers and many Catholics and Prote
stants have taken 
this seriously and preached against war utterly as 
un-Christian. Yet 
others, like Gratian and Thomas Aquinas crafted ?ju
st war? theories of 
great sophistication, and popes like Innocent the T
hird and Protestant 
leaders like Zwingli, and Anabaptist firebrands lik
e Thomas Muntzer 
believed that war and Christianity could walk hand 
in hand without 
embarrassment no matter what Jesus said. And yet, e
ven today, after all 
the bloody Christian vs Christian wars in Europe (a
nd the undeclared 
Christian war against the Native religions here), I
 can see, in this very 
parking lot, the wonderfully pacifist bumper sticke
r, ?When Jesus said 
‚Love your enemies, I think at the very least he mu
st have meant ‚Don™t 
kill them.™? 

 
 9 The Hebrew scriptures contain anti-war passages of 
stunning clarity, like 
Psalm 46, for example: 

?From the end to end of the whole earth, God 

stamps out war, breaking the bows, snapping the spe
ars, casting all 
shields into the flames.? 

Or you have the amazing story you heard this mornin
g from the scroll of 
Samuel, which, in a surprising anarchistic way, con
demns the whole 
idea of state leadership under a single sovereign a
s a pattern that leads 
inevitably to war, taxes, slavery and the whole sub
jection of a national 
economy to the whims of the powerful and self-servi
ng.  
 
But, at the same time, you will find passages where
 God is called ?a 
warrior,? who ?shatters the enemy,? (Exodus/Shemoth
 15),  and you will 
hear narratives of God commanding the Hebrews to mu
rder civilian 
populations. Because of the prevalence of anti-Jewi
sh thought in 
Christian cultures, most folks are aware of these m
urderous passages, 
and unaware of the pacifist passages, which outnumb
er the former. So 
please be very, very careful in your utterance, and
 avoid saying things to 
me like ?The Old Testament God is cruel and brutal 
and warlike, 
whereas the New Testament God is all sweetness and 
light.? It™s simply 
not true, and is a form of systemic Christian anti-
Jewishness which even 
Unitarian Universalists can be prone to. 

 
Still, the dichotomies among the Jews are just as r
eal as for the 
Christians.  For example, the later Talmudic rabbis
 maintained that 
?Whoever sheds blood diminishes the presence of God
 in the world.? 
(Gen. Rabbah 34:14) But, despite this clear opinion
, others continued to 
support the idea of 
milchamet chovah
, or obligatory war. 
 
How about the African religions in all their variet
y? War is often 
accepted as part of life, but many religious groups
 isolate the warrior 
who has killed for a period of time to purify him. 
Others have an 
important religious leader wash the bodies of the s
oldiers, and sacrifice 
an ox to 

remove the ghosts of their victims from their prese
nce. War is both seen 
as necessary and unfortunate, that is, 
an unfortunate need and curse
, 
never a ?blessing and a curse.? 

 10
  
Over the centuries, the various Hindus have produce
d scriptures that are 
actually set in the midst of wars, like the Bhagava
d-Gita. And wars have 
indeed pocked India™s long history. Yet this religi
ous tradition also lifted 
up the word ahimsa, or non-violence, as a central f
ocus, a focus which 
burned molten hot in the heart of Gandhi and many o
thers. I find it 
interesting though that even Gandhi referred to his
 non-violent 
demonstrations using military terms, and believed t
hat conflict was 
never to be avoided, but always faced, and that eve
n violence was better 
than cowardice. 

 
The Buddhists are perhaps the most clearly peaceful
 religious people on 
the planet.  

Although there are not many scriptures that actuall
y talk much about 
social issues in the modern sense of the word, ther
e is a clear teaching 
against all war, per se, in the 
Brahmajala Sutra
, where it is clearly 
taught that it is a sin, an error, even 
to watch
 a battle, which would make 
most American television watchers 

sinners all, since violence and battles are as comm
onplace on television 
as shells are on a beach. Still, in north Asia, Bud
dhist monks disregarded 
such teachings in great numbers, joining the secula
r military on 
expeditions that in no way could be considered just
. And some 
Buddhists have justified killing because according 
to the Buddhist 
teaching, no human being has an 
atta
, or an atman, or an eternal self. 
Therefore, since there is no self, there is no one 
who is really being 
killed. A strange circular argument, I™ll admit, bu
t one that enabled 
members of this most peaceful of religions to nonet
heless enter the 
throes of war.  These remain exceptions to the rule
, however. Ashoka of 
India, one of the greatest world leaders in the who
le history of humanity, 
was so converted by the peaceful teachings of Buddh
ism that his 
imperialist violent youth gave way entirely to a wi
se eldership that 
peacefully transformed the whole of South Asia for 
centuries. He raised 
stone tablets to confess and describe his remorse f
or his past wars all 
over India. 

 
The Shintos of Japan were a military religion from 
the beginning, 
without either scripture or prophet, a religion bas
ed on nature™s 

 11
 monuments,like mountains and streams,  and the maje
sty of the seasons. 
Yet among the Shinto, there too developed pacifist 
sects like Konko-
Kyo.  And in China, among both the Daoists and the 
Confucianists, you 
have a variety of opinions, ranging from warrior ha
ndbooks to 
denouncements of all force. 

 
In short, no matter where you go in human history, 
you will find people 
who claim for themselves a religion or philosophy w
ith principles or 
practices or beliefs and cultures. Some of these, w
ho for a variety of 
cultural, familial and even biological reasons, are
 prone to violence, read 
violence into their scriptures or customs. Those pr
one to peace for other 
reasons read peace in the self-same scriptures, or 
find peace supported 
by the self-same customs. This nearly universal fac
t tells me why 
Buddhism, although it has produced some warriors in
 its history, has 
produced so few by comparison to other religious or
 secular ideologies. 
Because, you see, Buddhism teaches the cultivation 
of personal 
selflessness, and a balanced inner peace, first and
 foremost. Going 
inward to ferret out the tendencies, or even possib
ilities of, violence 
within, is an everyday practice for sincere Buddhis
ts. If you do that first, 
even if you read a scripture which sounds violent, 
you will turn the page 
until you find a scripture or practice that express
es your own inner 
peace.  

After all, scripture does not interpret me. I have 
to interpret scripture. 
 
Me, personally, I am a Unitarian Universalist. I wa
sn™t raised one like 
my friend Roger, but I trust that my 38 years withi
n this tradition has 
grounded me more and more in reason as a religious 
approach, and 
tolerance as an initial and necessary practice for 
any spiritual deepening. 
So while everyone else is free to come to their own
 principled 
conclusions about war and peace, so am I. And Marga
ret Mead 
expresses my consistent reasoning these last 38 yea
rs very well. ?The 
first blow dealt to our enemies™ children,? she wri
tes, ?will sign the 
death warrant of our own.? In other words, 

if you make war on me for ANY reason, and kill my c
hild, my friend, 
my mother, my uncle, my second cousin twice removed
–I am going to 
probably want very much to declare war on you. 

And kill you and yours, since the foolishness of 

 12
 revenge has only rarely been successfully fought of
f in the last ten 
thousand years of human history. And then, when I h
ave wiped out those 
whom you love,  you would have to declare war again
st me. And so it 
will go on for another ten thousand years, mutual m
urder to no end. 
Until someone decides to stop it. (And here I have 
to remind everyone 
that in the country of the present war, 50% of the 
population is under 15 
years of age. In other words, it™s a nation of chil
dren.) 
 
People always bring up the Second World War when I 
say this. Yes, I 
understand. It was terrible. Hitler was a monster i
n the literal meaning of 
that term. I do not question that in the least. He 
certainly needed to be 
stopped. And they bring up the murder of the Jews, 
Gypsies, Gays, and 
non-cooperative Catholics, Protestants and Communis
ts, in death camps. 
?We HAD to go over there and stop all that murder.?
 But you know, 
these very same Jews were not welcomed at our door 
steps here in the 
States. We knew what the danger was. We sent many s
hips away, back 
to Germany and death. Our immigration folks certain
ly didn™t care much 
about those refugees we were supposedly fighting fo
r. And we never 
bombed the railway lines to Auschwitz, Bergen Belse
n et al, which 
wouldn™t have killed anyone™s child or mother, just
 twisted some metal. 
And that twisted metal would probably have saved a 
million lives. But 
we DID bomb places like Dresden into molten slag in
 which almost 
40,000 mostly civilians burned to ash. So, I™m sorr
y, even when people 
bring up the justice of a war, I find I will contin
ue to remain cautious. 
Even in a war for which a case might be made to cal
l it just, or at least 
necessary, there is much injustice. 

 
I am not Mahatma Gandhi. Not even close. But 

I still have to think that his approach to conflict
 merits more meditation. Or that we could meditate o
n a thousand other 
approaches that don™t end up with charred children.
 I am not convinced 
war has ever changed anyone™s mind any more than bu
rning someone at 
the stake changes his or her mind. It just kills th
em, not their heresy. 
And in the same way, killing children doesn™t chang
e anyone™s politics, 
but plants the seeds for the next war.  

 
Well, I™ve gone on and on. But I hope you get at le
ast this. If you want 

 13
 external authority to support violence and war, you
 can always find it. 
If you want external authority to wage peace, you c
an find it in a 
thousand holy books. But why not, I ask today, like
 my friend Roger, 
find an 
internal source of 
authority to make the practice of peace your 
own?

Lullaby
 ?When They Sleep? by Rolf Jacobsen 
a Norwegian poet. 

 
All people are children when they sleep. 

There is no war in them then. 

They open their hands and breath 

In that quiet rhythm heaven has given them. 

 
They pucker their lips like small children 

and open their hands halfway, 

soldiers and state leaders, servants and masters. 

The stars  stand guard, and a haze veils the sky 

during those few hours  

when no one does any harm. 

 
If only we could speak to one another then, 

when our hearts are half open flowers. 

Words like golden bees would drift in. 

O God, teach me the language of sleep.
