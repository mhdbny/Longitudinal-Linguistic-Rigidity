 To  Take  Life  Whole

Opening  

We are here, 

at  the  dawn  of  Autumn,  during  the  Days  of  
Awe,   
amid  cool  nights  and  the  first  fall  rains.  

We  gather  to  celebrate  the  possibilities  stil
l  before  us,   
and  garner  the  courage  among  this  community  
of  care,  
to  repair  what  is  ours  to  repair,  and  begin
  again  anew  in  a  spirit  of  love.   
And  so:  Grounded  in  gratitude  for  the  cosmos
  that  is  our  home,  claiming  
deepening  wisdom  as  our  authority,  and  daring
  to  engage  joy,  burden,  loss  and  
insight  in  a  deliberate  community  of  many  wa
ys  and  ages,  the  flame  summons  
us  to  
awaken
:  to  listen  with  our  whole  lives,  to  open, 
 to  serve.

A  look  at  the  calendar  will  only  confirm  wh
at  last  night™s  low  temperature  made  
clear:  it  is  summer  no  longer.  Let  us  rise,
  as  we  are  willing  or  able,  as  we  
welcome  autumn  with  the  first  verse  of  hymn

  v.  1   
Religion  and  Justice
  by  William  Schulz   
Religion  and  Justice  are  borne  on  each  other
™s  wings.  What  makes  them  
soulmates?   

Every  single  one  of  us  knows  what  it  is  li
ke  to  bleed.  Every one  of  us  has  
experienced  pain.   

If  that  were  not  a  fact  of  human  existence,
  we  might  not  notice  the  suffering  
of  the  world.   

Because  it  is,  we  do.   

 Every  single  one  of  us  knows  what  it  is  li
ke  to  bleed.  In  one  respect  pain  is  
a  gift  because  it  cultivates  our  imagination.
  Without  it,  we  would  be  far  less  
likely  to  rail  at  deprivation,  or  shrink  fro
m  cruelty.   
In  the  heart  of  every  stranger  lurks  a  refl
ection  of  our  own.   
Sequence   
As  the  center  of  our  time  together  approache
s,  let  us  enter  together  into  a  
time,  marked  by  the  toll  of  our  temple  bell
,  of  stillness,  imperfect  silence,  and  
reflection.   
May  these  words  now  move  us  forward  together
  into  such  a  time.   
In  the  heart  of  every  stranger  lurks  a  refl
ection  of  our  own.   
This  is  the  time  of  year  our  Jewish  cousins
  call  the  ?Days  of  Awe.?  The  
period  between  the  Jewish  New  Year  of  Rosh  
Hashanah  and  Yom  Kippur.  In  
the  Jewish  tradition,  this  is  a  time  to  loo
k,  with  as  much  unflinching  honesty  as  
we  can  muster,  at  the  way  in  which  we™ve  l
ived  since  the  previous  new  year.  
This  is  a  time  of  taking  stock,  and  making 
 amends  so  that  we  are  free  to  enter  
into  the  new  year,  with  as  clean  a  slate  a
s  possible.  These days are  not  lightly  
called  the ?Days  of  Awe.?   
In  the  heart  of  every  stranger  lurks  a  refl
ection  of  our  own.   
Friends  of  mine  love  the  HBO  series  
Game  of  Thrones
.  While  I™ve  never  seen  
the  show,  I™ve  read  enough  of  the  books  to 
 know  what  the  saying  from  the  
story,  
Winter  is  Coming
,  means.  When  the  cold  comes  we  won™t  do  s
o  well  on  
our own.  Winter  is  a  time  when  family  and  f
riends  are  most  needed.  We  need  
one another  for  warmth  and  support.  We  may  b
e  able  to  get  by  alone  when  the  
nights  are  warm,  but  winter  nights  are  anoth
er  matter  entirely.   
Though  winter  is  coming,  it  is  not  here  yet
.  Autumn  is  a  time  for  preparation.  
These  ?Days  of  Awe?  are  a  time  to  do  what 
 needs  to  be  done  to  be  able  to  
start  afresh.   
A  new  season  is  at  hand,  beaconing  like  the
  sound  of  this  bell.  Are  there  
things  in  your  life  that  deserve  a  fresh  st
art?  If  so,  how  can  you  bring  those  
possibilities  to  life?   
bell   
We  carry  with  us  into  each  new  day  those  w
ho  have  helped  make  us  who  we  
are.  Into  the  stillness  now  let  us  bring  to
  mind  the  names  of  those  we  love,  
those  who  challenge  us  in  old  familiar  or  b
rand  new  ways,  those  we  miss,  
those  we  long  to  see  again  soon.  We  name  t
hem  now,  either  softly  into  this  
shared  space,  or  silently  in  the  embrace  of 
 our  hearts.   
naming   

 From  stillness  and  whispers,  the  space  in  wh
ich  we  gather  calls  for  more. Listen.  
?Fill  me,?  cry  these  surrounding  walls.  ?We  
have  endured  the  first  strong  winds  
of  autumn.  Fill  this  space  with  music.  Let  
there  be  song.?   
Readings   

Our  first  reading  this  morning  is  an  excerpt
  from  Joan Didion™s  book  
Blue  Nights
.  
Her  previous  book,  
A  Year  of  Magical  Thinking
,  was  a  memoir  of  her  grief  in  
the  aftermath  of  her  husband™s  death.  
Blue  Nights
  is  about  her  response  to  the  
death  of  their  adopted  daughter.  This  selecti
on  is  about  her  own  health.  It  will  
be  helpful  to  know  that Didion  has  lived  for
  the  last  many  years  in  Manhattan.   
?I see a  new  neurologist.  The  new  neurologist 
 has  answers:  all  new  neurologists  
have  answers,  usually  wishful.  New  neurologist
s  remain  the  last  believers  in  the  
power  of  wishful  thinking.  The  answers  offere
d  by  the  particular  new  neurologist  
are  for  me  to  gain  weight  and  devote  a  min
imum  of  three  hours  a  week  to  
physical  therapy.   
I have  been  through  this  catechism  before.   

I happen  to  have  been  a  remarkably  small  chi
ld.  I  say  remarkably  for  a  
reason:  something  about  my  size  was  such  tha
t  perfect  strangers  could  be  relied  
to  remark  upon  it.  ‚You™re  not  very  thick,™ 
 I  recall  a  doctor  saying  when  I  went  
to  see  him  for  an antibiotic  prescription.   
The  new  neurologist  offers,  in  addition  to  g
aining  weight  and  doing  physical  
therapy,  a  third,  although  equally  wishful,  a
nswer:  the  diagnosis  I  received  in  my  
late  twenties  notwithstanding,  I  do  not  have 
 multiple  sclerosis.  Magnetic  
Resonance  Imaging,  a  technique  not  yet  availa
ble  when  I  was  in  my  twenties,  
conclusively  demonstrates  that  I  do  not  have 
 multiple  sclerosis.   
In  that  case,  I  ask,  what  is  it  that  I  do
  have?   
I have  neuritis,  a  neuropathy,  a  neurological 
 inflammation.   
I  ask  what  caused  this  neuritis,  this  neurop
athy,  this  neurological  inflammation.   
Not weighing enough,  he  answers.  It  does  not  
escape  me  that  the  consensus  
on  what  is  wrong  with  me  has  once  again  in
sinuated  the  ball  into  my  court.   
I  am  referred to  a  dietitian  on  this  matter 
 of  gaining  weight.   
The  dietitian  makes  (the  inevitable)  protein  
shakes,  brings  me  freshly  laid  eggs  
(better)  from  a  farm  in  New  Jersey  and  perf
ect  vanilla  ice  cream  (better  still)  
from  Maison  du  Chocolat.   

I drink the  protein  shakes.   

I  eat  the  freshly  laid  eggs  from  the  farm  
in  New  Jersey  and  the  perfect  vanilla  
ice  cream  from  Maison  du  Chocolat.   

 Nonetheless.   

I do not gain weight.   

I  find,  on  the  other  hand,  somewhat  to  my  
surprise,  that  I  actively  like  the  
physical  therapy.  I  keep  regular  appointments 
 at  the  sports  medicine  facility  at  
Sixtieth  and  Madison.  I  am  impressed  by  the 
 strength  and  general  tone  of  the  
other  patients  who  turn  up  during  the  same  
hour.  I  study  their  balance,  their  
proficiency  with  the  various  devices  recommend
ed  by  the  therapist.  The  more  I  
watch,  the  more  encouraged  I  am:  this  stuff 
 really  works,  I  tell  myself.  The 
thought  makes  me  cheerful,  optimistic.  I  wond
er  how  many  appointments  it  will  
take  to  reach  the  apparently  effortless  contr
ol  already  achieved  by  my  fellow  
patients.  Only  during  my  third  week  of  physi
cal  therapy  do  I  learn  that  these  
particular  fellow  patients  are  in  fact  the  N
ew  York  Yankees,  loosening  up  
between  game  days.? 

For  our  second  reading  today,  I  turn  again  
to  the  succinct  clarity  of  John  
Berger,  English  born  critic  of  art,  society  
and  politics.   
?Between  the  experience  of  living  a  normal  l
ife  at  this  moment  on  the  planet  
and  the  public  narratives  being  offered  to  g
ive  a  sense  of  that  life,  the  empty  
space,  the  gap,  is  enormous.   

Every  day,  all  over  the  world,  media  network
s  replace reality  with  lies.   
All  the  lies  converge  into  one  colossal  fals
ehood:  the  supposition  that  life  itself  
is  a  commodity  and  that  those  who  can  affor
d  to  buy  it  are,  by  definition,  those  
who  deserve  it.?   

Sermon   

You  might  think  that  by  now,  I  would  have  
learned  to  be  careful  about  what  I  
choose  to  preach  about.   

Especially  now  that  I  don™t  preach  as  often 
 as  I  used  to  earlier  in  my  career,  
when  I  was  a  solo  minister,  it  seems  as  if
  every  time  I  put  a  topic  out  there,  
life  provides  ever  more  material  for  subject 
 matter.  Sometimes I™m grateful  for  
that.  But  there  are  other  times  when  I™d  pu
t  a  cap  on  it  if  I  could.  Today,  as  
you  will  have  guessed,  is  one  of  those  latt
er  times.   
The  phrase 
to  take  life  whole
 comes  from  a  reading  I  often  share  towards 
 the  
close  of  memorial  services.  I™ve  said  the  wo
rds  often  enough  that  even  if  I  don™t  
use  them  in a given  memorial,  they  still  retu
rn  as  part  of  my  reflection.  As  we  
had  a  number  of  those  late  last  month,  the 
 phrase  was  on  my  mind  once  
again.     

Here  is  the  passage,  adapted  slightly  from  m
y  colleague,  the  Rev. Kendyl 
Gibbons:   

 ?There  is,  finally,  only  one  thing  required  
of  us; that  is,  to  take  life  whole,  the  
bright  and  dark  together; to  live  the  life  t
hat  is  given  us  with  courage and  humor  
and  truth.   

We  have  such  a  little  moment,  out  of  the  v
astness  of  time, for  all  our  wondering  
and  loving.  Therefore,  let  there  be  no  half-
heartedness; rather, let [our  souls]  be  
ardent  Š in  [facing  grief],  in  yearning,  [and
  in  offering]  praise.  Then  may  peace  
enfold  our  days, and  [grace]  shall  not  fade  
from  our  lives.?   
 
What  I  like  about  those  words  is  that  they 
 seem honest  and  hopeful  at  the  
same  time.  They remind me to  keep  perspective. 
 How  many  times  has  it  helped  
to  remember  that  I™m  only  one  piece  of  a  m
uch  larger  puzzle,  and  that  to  let  
myself  be  overwhelmed by the scope  of  it  all  
takes  my  focus  away  from  what  I  
can  do,  what  I  can  be?   
to  take  life  whole,  the  bright  and  dark  tog
ether;   
to  live  the  life  that  is  given  us   
with  courage  and  humor  and  truth. 
These  words  came  back  to  me  two  weeks  ago, 
 when  I  was  playing  nursemaid  
for  my  girlfriend  Ann, after  she  had  surgery 
 on  each  eye  to  slow  the  progression  
of  glaucoma.   

Now, what  you  need  to  know  about  Ann  is  tha
t, besides  being  an  absolute  
delight,  Ann  is  a  tough  cookie.  She  worked  
at  Grant  Hospital  with  families  
whose  loved  ones  had  been  declared  brain  dea
d,  talking  with  them  about  the  
possibility  of  organ  donation,  of  giving  the 
 gift  of  life  to  others.     
The  other  thing  you  need  to  know  about  Ann,
  and  it  relates  to  her  being  a  
tough  cookie,  is  that  she  has  a  tolerance  f
or  pain  that  is  off  the  charts.  I  won™t  
go  into  details,  but  I  will  say  this:  if  I
  had  to  experience  the  levels  of  pain  she  
has  lived  with  for  years  now  I  would  not  b
e  standing  here.  I  would  be  a  puddle  
somewhere,  making  my  way  slowly  to  the  Ohio 
 River.   
When  she  told  me  after  the  procedure  on  eac
h  of  her  eyes,  ?That  was  hard,?  I  
knew  that  her  doctor  had  seriously  miscalcula
ted  when  she  told  Ann  that  she  
would  be  able  to  drive  herself  home.   

We were doing  so  well  with  the  eye  drops.  On
ly there wasn™t  just  one  set  of  
drops.  While  we  were  good  about  the  medicina
l  drops,  we  had  both  forgotten  
about  the  drops  to  help  keep  her  eyes  prope
rly  lubricated.  The surgeries  were  
on  Wednesday  and  Thursday  two  weeks  ago.  Whi
le  she  couldn™t  look  at  her 
computer  screen  long,  she  did  a  little  work 
 that  Friday.  But  by  Sunday  afternoon  
the  pain  was  too  great  to  ignore.  She  went 
 to  bed  at  3:00pm and  didn™t  get  up  
until  the  next  morning.   

Do  you  know  how  many  doctors  answer  their  p
hones  on  Sunday evening?  Not 
enough.   

 It™s  a  terrible  feeling  not  to  be  able  to  
make  things  better  for  someone  you  love.   
But,  as  I  have  seen  her  do  before,  Ann  ral
lied  the  next  day.   
We  finally  got  in  touch  with  her  doctor,  wh
o reminded  us  about  the  other  drops  
we  had  forgotten  all  about.  Insert  a  heavy  
dose  of  self-recrimination, and a small  
helping  of  frustration  with  one™s  partner  her
e.   
The  new  drops  did  the  trick,  and  by  all  ac
counts  Ann™s  eyes  are  in  much  better  
shape  now  than  they  were  before.   
to  take  life  whole,  the  bright  and  dark  tog
ether;   
to  live  the  life  that  is  given  us   
with  courage  and  humor  and  truth. 
It  can  be  exhausting,  this  business  of  life,
  especially  when  we  open  ourselves  to  
living  it  as  fully  as  possible.  Exhausting, b
ut also enlivening.   
Joan  Didion™s  account  of  medical  catechisms,  
useless  protein  shakes,  and  
working  out  with  the  New  York  Yankees  highli
ghts  how  perfectly  absurd  life  can  
be.  What  she  doesn™t  tell  us  is  how  long  s
he  continued  physical  therapy  after  
she  learned  she  was  training  with  professiona
l  athletes,  and  we  would  be  wise  
to  guess  that  it  wasn™t  long.   

But,  for  at  least  those  three  weeks, watching
  the  baseball  players  encouraged  
her.   

While  I  doubt  none  of  the  Yankees  was  born 
 into  a  body  as  slight  as  Joan  
Didion™s,  you  can  be  sure  they  didn™t  get  w
here  they  did  without  training  hard.   
The  more  I  think  about  it,  and  while  the  i
dea  threatens  to  devolve  into  a  bad  
late  night  TV  joke,  the  more  I  hope  Didion 
 continued  working  out  with  the  boys.  
The  irony  is  too  good  to  pass  up,  and  who 
 says  a  little  beefcake  isn™t  good  for  
the  soul,  anyway?   

Still  we  are  called  to  take  life  whole,  and
  there  is  more  to  life  than  Joan  
Didion™s  rye  humor  and  the  New  York  Yankees.
   
As  we  strive  to  live  ?the  life  that  is  giv
en  us  with  courage,?  we  learn  how  it  
works  for  us  to  go  solo,  and  how  it  works 
 for  us  to  be  part  of a larger  group.   
There  are  times  we  feel  so  pulled  by  all  o
ur  commitments  that  we  long  to  step  
aside  and  unplug  from  them.   

How  many  times  are  you  being  contacted  by  e
ither  or  all  of  the  political  parties  
asking  for  your  vote  and  a  donation?  Phone, 
email, FaceBook, Twitter:  they™ve  got  
them  all  covered.  It  wouldn™t  surprise  me  if
  Obama  won  the  election  when  he  
said  he  was  sick  and  tired  of  it  all,  too.
   

 As  much  as  we™re  stretched  as  thin  as  we  c
an imagine,  and  as  much  as  retreat  
looks  like  a  better  option  everyday,  we  do  
ourselves  a  disservice  when  we  
forget  that  there  are  ways  to  engage  that  g
ive  as  well  as  take,  and  we  fail  to  
do  our  share.   

I  want  to  return  now  to  the  story  Wendy  to
ld  earlier.  It™s a  simple  legend,  known  
across  the  world.  But  that  doesn™t  mean  it™s
  no  longer  instructive.   
Here  is  a  bundle  of  sticks.  Together  like  t
his,  they  give  their  strength  to  one  
another.  Can  you  break  it?  (Don™t try 
too
 hard.)   
What  happens  when  we  remove  one  of  them?   

One  more?  Two?  Three?   

Each  time  a  single  stick  is  removed,  the  ot
hers  take  on  more  of  the  burden.  
Under  continuing  pressure,  at  some  point  the 
 bundle  will  break.   
In  our  second  reading  earlier,  John  Berger  m
ay  have  sounded  strident  to  us.  
Folks  who  talk  about  the  powers  that  be  cla
iming  that  life  is  a  commodity  tend  
to  sound  that  way.   

But  it™s  hard  not  to  feel  treated  like  a  c
ommodity  when  insurance  companies  
control  our  access  to  health  care.   

Yet  life  is  not  a  commodity.  It  is  a  preci
ous,  vulnerable  gift.  One  we  are  called  
to  support  and  protect.   

We are stronger  together.  When  we  all  do  our 
 share  we  are  stronger  than  we  
might  imagine.  When we  give of  ourselves,  we  
receive  as  well.   
And  if  all  of  this  sounds  like  a  plug  for 
 this  afternoon™s  Justice  JAM  brought  to  
you  by  our  congregation™s  Justice  Action  Mini
stries,  you™d  be  right.   
So  after  you  get  your  coffee,  I  encourage  y
ou  to  go  up  to  someone  at  one  of  
the  tables  in  Fellowship  Hall.  They  will  be 
 more  than  happy  to  tell  you  about  a  
project  they  are  representing,  the  good  they 
 are  doing,  whether  that  be  in  
preparing  and  serving  meals  at  Faith  Mission 
 every  other  Friday,  helping  folks  
register  to  vote,  or  helping  take  a  stand  f
or  women™s  health  and  reproductive  
rights.  These  are  good  people,  doing  great  w
ork,  and  it  is  worth  your  time  to  
learn  about  what  they  are  doing,  just  so  th
at  you  can    thank  them  at least.  But  
also  ask  them  something  else.  Ask  the  folks 
 at  the  tables  how  what  they  do  
nourishes  them.  And  be  ready  to  engage  them 
 in  a  real  conversation  once  you  
see  their  eyes  light  up.   

Let  me  be  clear:  none  of  us  can  do  everyth
ing.  While we  are  capable,  we  are  
also  limited.  Together,  bound  by  intention  an
d  care,  we  give  our  strength  to  one  
another.  This  is  the  magic  that  makes  the  w
hole  greater  than  the  sum  of  its  
parts.   

 I  did  not  like  seeing  Ann  in  such  pain  tha
t  it  quite  literally  shut  her  down.  But  
there  was  no  place  else  I  would  rather  have
  been,  but  at  her  side.   
We  stand  by  those  we  love.   

The  harder  thing  is  remembering  that  
in  the  heart  of  every  stranger  lurks  a  
reflection  of  our  own.   

And  if  that  is  hard  for  us  to  do  separatel
y,  we  can  still  come  together  to  so  
alongside  one  another.  

The  challenge  is  remembering  that  standing  by
  family  isn™t  enough  when  the  
commons  are  being  paved  over  for  additional  
parking.  When  the  social  fabric  
isn™t  strong,  or  even  present,  it  doesn™t  ma
tter  how  rich  you  are,  there  won™t  be  
anything  there  to  hold  you  when  you  need  pr
opping  up.   
So  we  are  called  to  do  our  share.  We  can  
do  it  with  others  so  that  it  doesn™t  
become  too  much  of  a  burden.   
?There  is,  finally,  only  one  thing  required  
of  us; 
 that  is,  to  take  life  whole,  the  bright  an
d  dark  together; 
  to  live  the  life  that  is  given  us  with  c
ourage   
   and  humor  and  truth.  

We  have  such  a  little  moment,  out  of  the  v
astness  of  time, for  all  our  
wondering  and  loving. 

Therefore,  let  there  be  no  half-heartedness; 

 rather,  let  [our  souls]  be  ardent  Š in  [fac
ing  grief],  in  yearning,  [and  in  
offering]  praise. 

Then  may  peace  enfold  our  days,   

 and  [grace]  shall  not  fade  from  our  lives.?
   
 Together, my  friends,  together.   

Offering   

In  gratitude  for  all  that  went  into  making  
this  congregation  as  truly  vital  as  it  is,  
we  pause  now  for  a  moment  of  both  appreciat
ion  and  generosity.   
Together  we  support  such  a  community  as  best
  we  can,  in  many  ways,  through  
our  human  presence,  our  gifts  behind  the  sce
nes, and  through  this  ancient  and  
thoughtful  way  of  supporting  what  we  love.   

Our  ushers  will  now  come  forward.  The offerin
g  will  be  given  and  gratefully  
received. 

A  Mitzvah  for  Two  Voices  
  by  Rev.  Erika  Hewitt   
Reader  1   I  don™t  have  anything  to  say.   

 Reader  2   Well,  I  do Œ but  it  might  not  be 
  
 interesting  to  anyone.   

Reader  1   I  have  secrets  inside  of  me,  and 
  
 struggles,  and  I  don™t  know  if  I™m  ready   

 to  share  them.   

Reader  2   I  want  to  hear  what  you  have  to 
 say.   
Reader  1   I  want  to  speak  of  the  deepest  t
hings   
 together.   

Reader  2   I  want  to  hear  what  you  dream  ab
out,   
 what  you  hope  for.   

Reader  1   I  want  to  know  how  you  have  come
  to   
 arrive  at  this  resting  point  along  your   

 journey.   

Reader  2   What  if  I  speak,  and  you  don™t  u
nderstand  me?   
Reader  1   I  will  listen,  and  listen  again,  
until  my  | 
 hearing  becomes  understanding.   

Reader  2   What  if  I  can™t  find  the  words  t
o  share   
 the  world  inside  of  me?   

Reader  1   I  believe  that  wise  words  will  em
erge   
 from  you.   

Reader  2   How  can  I  trust  you  to  hold  my  
life™s   
 stories?  You, who I  may  not  even  know?   

Reader  1   By  knowing  that,  as  I  receive  par
t  of   
 your  story,  I  will  give  you  part  of  mine. 
  
Reader  2   How  will  this  work?  What will happe
n?   
 What awaits  us?   

Reader  1   We  can  find  out  anything  by  begin
ning.   
Reader  2   Let  us  begin  to  listen,  and  trust
,  and  to   
 know  one  another  more  deeply.   

Singing    #1037    
We  Begin Again  in  Love
   
For  remaining  silent  when  a  single  voice  wou
ld  have  made  a  difference–
   
For  each  time  that  our  fears  have  made  us  
rigid  and  inaccessible–
   

 For  each  time  we  have  struck  out  in  anger  
without  just  cause–
   
For  each  time  that  our  greed  has  blinded  us
  to  the  needs  of  others–
   
For  the  selfishness  that  set  us  apart  and  a
lone–
   
For  falling  short  of  the  admonitions  of  the 
 spirit–
   
For losing  sight  of  our  unity–
 For  those,  and  for  so  many  other  acts,  both
  evident  and  subtle, which  have  
fueled  the  illusion  of  separateness–
   
Benediction   

Too  often  we  find  ourselves  pining  for  a  ne
w  day,  a  brighter  day.  Well, you 
know  what?  You have it within you  to  say  that 
 day  begins...  Now.    
The new day is here.  Begin  it  with  conviction  
in  your  step,  joy  in  your  heart,  
courage  in  your  bearing  and  love,  always  lov
e,  in  your  hands.
