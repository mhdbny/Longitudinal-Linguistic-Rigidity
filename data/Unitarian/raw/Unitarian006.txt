  In 1896, Beatrix Potter came face-to-face with the first barrier for the
  symbiosis pioneers-ignorant prejudice. The soon-to-be-famous children's author
  and illustrator was hounded out of biology by the closed ranks and narrow
  minds of London's top scientific institutes. Their members, all male, refused
  to accept Potter's evidence that lichens, those curious (things) living on
  tree trunks, seashores, and walls, were made up of not one but two organisms
  in intimate alliance. Yet her insight was more far-reaching than either she
  or her contemporaries could ever have dreamed.
  
  Not only lichens, but also almost every tree, bush, and grass on Earth leads
  a double life-married to a fungus. While orchids and oak trees appear to
  be individuals, in reality they live in an inextricably interwoven liaison
  with a worldwide web of underground fungal foragers. A century after the
  stifling of Beatrix Potter's search for natural truths and her final retreat
  into voluntary exile, we can now celebrate her radically new view of life.
  Interconnectivity can be a strength rather than merely a source of potential
  conflict; a vital resource rather than a drain.

  I shall always call myself Unitarian because of my father and my mother,
  but for the Unitarians as a Dissenting body, as I know them in London, I
  have no respect. Their creed is apt to be a timid, illogical compromise,
  their forms of Service a badly performed imitation of the Church (of England).
  We are not Christians in the commonly accepted sense of the term. (I) Believe
  there is a great power silently working in all things for good. Behave yourself,
  and never mind the rest.
