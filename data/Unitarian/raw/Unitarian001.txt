I actually give copies away to people who find it worthy of further meditation.
is a poem by the prolific Linda Pastan. Because it is very subtle, I will
ask Caroline to read it twice.for R after the accidentMen are from Mars and women are from Venus. Oh, all Scorpios are like that. Oh, you know how emotional those Sicilians are! What do you expect from
an electrical engineer? "I shall forgive last the delicately wounded
who, having been slugged no harder than anyone else, never
got up again, neither to fight back,
nor to finger their jaws in painful admiration."O Love, let the summer sun outside me 
come inside me and warm my heart.
Open my soul like an August mum,
and let it hum with a palette of feelings
as wide and lovely as a garden of many flowers.
May the sweetness of the last days of summer
return me to the days when I was less hard on myself, and less hard on
others.
Let the tenderness of these last days of August
open me to the stream of life
flowing around me, and through me,
outside of my illusions of control. 
May I find myself more content
with my discontent, and dream no more
for any personal peace 
that resembles sleep more than any life. 
Let the four corners of my soul be lifted up, 
like a summer picnic blanket, 
that all the crumbs and scraps might fall to earth, 
and I might be made useful again for other joys and pleasures yet to come.
And now let me sing, as the proof of the power that is
summer, that is love, that is spirit, within me, without me, among
us. Amen.
