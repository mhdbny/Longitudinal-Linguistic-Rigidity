 12008-Sept1:Worry&Vision MLB 

 
Opening Words 

 
We are here 

to take up the example of summer roses 

by blossoming, by being ourselves fully. 

As diverse human beings in free community, 

may we see our worries and weariness 

through the clear, clear lens of Love. 

 
And so, though our ways of thinking and feeling abo
ut the meaning of our 
days may differ, we agree to journey together, side
 by side, face to face. 
Within this circle of strong spirit, mutual care, a
nd ethical vision, may we 
ourselves remain open to being transformed by a wel
coming heart and 
emerging justice.
  
Sequence 

 
The roses and dahlias blossom of themselves. 

It is their nature to grow, to blossom. 

In solemn dance with the sun and moon, 

which blossom in the sky. 

In solemn dance with the rain clouds, 

which blossom unbidden in the heavens. 

But gardeners blossom too. 

Their nature is to hoe, and mulch, 

and labor with pruning shears. 

And the nature of designers is to labor to draw the
 image of those shears.  
And factory workers labor to hinge their blades and
 sharpen them just so. It™s 
their nature. 

And miners labor at machines to pull the 

ore from the earth which can be poured 

into the molds that give us blades and hinges. 

It™s their nature. 

And the nature of farmers and grocers is to labor t
o feed the miners and factory 
workers and designers and gardeners with strength f
or their own work. 

 2And on this holiday weekend at summer™s end, 

the eyes of all those who labor now mirror the beau
ty of roses and dahlias back 
into the world, 

where the nature of everything is to grow, 

to blossom, to become more and more 

what they are.  And preachers labor too. They hoe a
nd mulch and prune this 
very moment with words, that silence too might blos
som, and become more 
and more what it is. 

 
silence 

 
The labor, the very nature, of those with human hea
rts, is to remember and love 
other human hearts, to greet them with our mutual h
umanity, 
both in person, and in the imaginative life 

of the heart. Now we bless the silence by 

remembering those who by their presence 

in our lives have enabled us to be the 

people we are becoming. These we name in 

silent or whispered thanksgiving. 

 
naming 

 
Like roses, like dahlias, the nature of musicians 

is to blossom and offer heartbreaking beauty. 

 
The First Reading
 this morning comes from Rebecca Parker, the ministe
r who 
serves as president of Starr King School for the Mi
nistry in Berkeley 
California. Our neighboring Unitarian Universalist 
minister Susan Ritchie, up 
in Lewis Center, is teaching there for a full semes
ter this fall–history and 
ministerial practice.  

 
Paulo Freire Œ (the late and much honored Brazilian
) educator Œ can assist us in 
defining the purpose of education.  For Paulo Freir
e, the purpose of education 
is humanization, ?the struggle to recover lost huma
nity.?  ?Dehumani-zation,? 
he writes, ?which marks not only those whose humani
ty has been stolen, but 
also those who have stolen it, is a distortion of t
he vocation of becoming more 
fully human.?  To be fully human ?is to be a subjec
t who acts upon and 

 3transforms–(the) world, and in so doing move(s) tow
ards ever new 
possibilities of fuller and richer life, individual
ly and collectively.  
 
Dehumanization, however, cuts us 
off
 from experiencing the world.  The 
dehumanized are submerged in the world, passively s
haped, controlled, 
determined, and used for the purposes of others Œ b
ut they are not active in the 
world. 

 
Education thus becomes ‚the practice of freedom,™ t
he means by which men 
and women deal critically, and creatively, with rea
lity, and discover how to 
participate in the transformation of their world.? 

 
Freire emphasizes that ?the pursuit of full humanit
y–cannot be carried out in 
isolation, but only in fellowship and solidarity– A
ttempting to be more human 
individualistically 
leads to
 having
 more 
egotistically
.  ?Radical trust in 
people,? Freire says, ?
is
 at the heart of revolutionary teaching.? 
 
The liberation of humanness is not simply a matter 
of casting off an oppressor.  
It involves re-collecting, re-discovering, and re-e
ngaging powers of the soul 
that have been silenced, suppressed, split off, or 
denied by dehumanizing social 
systems.  Such reparation can be the work of a life
time, an unfolding process of 
claiming and manifesting the power of life within o
neself. 
 
The Second Reading
 comes from David Richo™s most excellent book The Fi
ve 
Things You Cannot Change and the Happiness We Find 
By Embracing Them
.  
This is a longer reading. But don™t imagine that I 
expect you to take everything 
in. Just let what you notice and hold on to be some
thing you think about later. 
Different folks will respond to different ideas. 

 
 Most of us think of virtues in terms of specific wo
rds (such as 
honesty
 and 
patience
) rather than in sentences that describe behaviors.
  However, a spiritual 
practice of building virtue focuses on them as spec
ific actions.  Ponder one 
virtue from the following list and look for ways to
 put it into practice. 
 1.
 I am happy to appear as I am, without pretense, and
 no matter how 
unflattering.  I am not perfect, but rather than si
mply pass through 
experiences without awareness, I choose to pause lo
ng enough to address 

 4and process what is happening to me.  I learn from 
my own reactions:  
Tears at a movie invite me to look at my personal g
riefs.  Attraction and 
repulsion invite me to look at my hidden needs and 
motives.  Memories and 
images that tug at me invite me to stay with them a
nd to follow their lead 
into my own unopened spaces. 
2.
 I am not caught up in regret or self-reproach becau
se of my mistakes in 
life.  I take it all as a learning experience so I 
can do better in the future.  I 
make amends whenever I can. 
3.
 I listen carefully to others™ feedback rather than 
become defensive or ego-
aroused by it.  I welcome feedback that shows me wh
ere I am less caring 
than I can be, where I am less tolerant, where less
 open. 
4.
 I notice that my behavior and choices are no longer
 determined by what 
others may think of me. 
5.
 The events in life and the actions of others impact
 me, but they do not 
impinge. I remain secure within myself and, at the 
same time, connected to 
others. 
6.
 I forgo taking advantage of others by using any cha
rms of body, word, or 
mind to trick or seduce them.  To grow in humility,
 I blow the whistle on 
myself when I notice myself being phony, mendacious
, passive-aggressive, 
or manipulative.  
7.
 I ask for what I want without demand, manipulation,
 or expectation.  I 
remain respectful of the timing, wishes, and limits
 of others.  I can take no 
for an answer. 
8.
 I have a sense of humor but not at the expense of o
thers. 
9.
 My question is not ?What can I get away with?? but 
?What is the right 
thing to do?? 
10.
 I keep my word.  I honor commitments and I follow t
hrough on the tasks 
I agree to do.  More and more I can tell what my li
mits and skills are.  This 
helps me set sane boundaries on how much I offer to
 do for others, rather 
than simply being accommodating. 
11.
 I am thankful for the values and helpful beliefs th
at I received in the 
course of my life from so many sources.  At the sam
e time, I am examining 
the scaffoldings of beliefs, biases, and myths I in
herited from family, 
school, religion, and society. 
12.
 I am no longer under the blinding influence of the 
four main streets that 
direct so many attitudes and lifestyles:  Madison A
venue, Tin Pan Alley, 
Wall Street and Hollywood Boulevard. 

 513.
 My work on myself has made me more conscious of the
 politics and 
stresses of the world around me.  I question author
ity while affirming, 
praying and working for an end to war, retaliation,
 greed, hate and 
ignorance.  This is based on the fact that I have n
ot given up on believing 
in the possibility of transformation for every pers
on, political and religious 
leader, and nation. 
14.
 Confronted with the suffering in the world, I do no
t turn my eyes away, 
nor do I get stuck in blaming God or humanity but s
imply ask:  ?What then 
shall 
I do?? 
15.
 My love of nature makes me tread gently on the eart
h with what Saint 
Bonaventura called ?a courtesy toward natural thing
s.? 
 
Sermon 

 
My friend Devere is a funny guy. What I mean by tha
t is that he makes me 
laugh. He has a genius for word-play and joking tha
t few equal. 
And I think he enjoys my ready laughter. Thus, we e
njoy each other™s company 
immensely. But this week I saw another side of Deve
re. And, more importantly 
for this sermon, another side of myself. 

 
Devere and I were talking about the political scene
 in the States right now. 
?Did you hear the big acceptance speech last night?
? he asked. ?Did you go 
wild over it like everyone else?? 

Now he said this with such cynicism that I simply s
aid, ?Hmmm–sounds like 
at least 
you
 were not impressed.? 
 
?You got that right,? he said. ?I don™t trust eithe
r of those two guys. I mean, 
how can anyone trust the American political world n
o matter who runs? They 
all make promises which they don™t keep. It™s prett
y easy to make a convincing 
case that the last two elections were out-and-out s
tolen, making the whole idea 
of voting a complete waste of time. And then there 
is the whole nonsense of the 
Electoral College. I am registered to vote this yea
r, but I don™t think I am going 
to. I am disgusted.? 

 
Now this little speech Devere made was not at all h
umorous. It did not make 
me roll on the floor and guffaw like I usually do w
hen he is holding forth. 
Instead, I found myself growing irate.  

 6 
?Not vote?? I said incredulously, the full choir of
 every civics teacher I ever 
had standing behind me and tearing their hair out. 
?Not vote?? 
 
We talked a few more minutes. My face grew flushed.
 I was aggravated. But 
then I noticed the clock and I had to get to the of
fice to compose this sermon, 
so I bid him farewell. But I didn™t hug him as we u
sually do when we greet and 
depart. I just left in a huff and went to my car. S
teaming. 
 
When I got to the office, I re-read the longer read
ings I had chosen for today. 
They brought me up short. And, I started to realize
 how much work I have to 
do about what had just transpired. After all, altho
ugh I most certainly intend to 
vote, Devere 
is
 expressing what I sometimes feel deep inside, and 
what many 
others feel deep inside, but don™t express so forth
rightly. 
 
Devere expresses very well the generalized worry, p
anic, and anxiety of many 
modern folks in the States these days (although in 
fairness, I seem to remember 
that critiques of the electoral college go all the 
way back to my gradeschool).  
 
Worry and anxiety seem to be at an all time high, a
t least in my memory. I am 
not just talking about the high gas prices, the exp
ressed fears of a repeat of the 
Great Depression of the 1930™s, and so forth. 

 
I am talking about the great changes in American cu
lture, too. The auto 
industry in my hometown of Detroit is almost down f
or the count. Other US 
industries have migrated overseas. On this Labor Da
y weekend, 
unemployment, layoffs and underemployment are all r
ife. What few energy and 
environmental policies there are scary. Medical ins
urance is almost a joke. 
Medical students and computer experts are more ofte
n studying now in Delhi 
India rather than at MIT or John Hopkins. The life-
expectancy in Europe and 
Japan is way higher than it is here in the States. 
College expenses are beyond 
reach for many people, even with scholarship help. 

 
With these vast new realities, expressions of high 
anxiety seem to be way over 
the top. For example, Devere showed me all of these
 websites about the 
coming of Nibiru. Never heard of Nibiru? Neither ha
d I. 
 
 7But there are literally hundreds of sites dedicated
, in all seriousness, to this 
planet x. When Devere first showed me one of the si
tes, I had a hard time 
believing what I was seeing and hearing. 

 
There are altering versions of the story, but in br
ief, it™s like this: out beyond 
the edge of our solar system, they say there is a b
rown dwarf star with two 
planets orbiting it. This star system is in a big c
igar-shaped orbit around our 
own sun. In the next two years, we are told, these 
objects will come close 
enough to earth to see with the naked eye. And in t
he year 2012, one of them 
will hit us squarely, and utterly destroy our whole
 planet, including us. 
 
I said to Devere, ?Do people really believe this? O
h brother, this is just the plot 
of George Pal™s 1951 film 
When Worlds Collide
, with cheesy special effects.? 
 
The sites claim of course that the two planets are 
inhabited, and that certain 
choice folks may make it off the earth in rockets, 
but again, that is part of the 
plot of the famous Pal film. 

 
But the thing is, these sites are not isolated. Man
y people in the last seven years 
or so have been yammering about the world ending in
 2012. Some interpret a 
certain Native American calendar as predicting it. 
And smirking televangelists 
like John Hagee and Jack van Impe have been accruin
g evidence that the end of 
the world, according to familiar evangelical procla
mation, will probably be 
happening around that same year, even though ?no on
e can know the exact date 
or hour.? 

 
To all of which I say, so what? Periods of high anx
iety and worry have 
appeared in our United States history like clockwor
k. Similar highly fanciful 
stories of the apocalypse and the end of the world 
accompany every such 
period of cultural shake-up. George Pal™s movie, fo
r example, was based on a 
novel written by Philip Wylie in 1933, when the wor
ld was beginning to 
develop the shakes because of Nazi Germany, and the
 horror of the Great 
Depression following the prosperous ‚20s.  

 
And before that, lurid predictions of the end of th
e world surrounded the Civil 
War, Reconstruction, and the rise of Darwinism and 
Marxism.  In the 1950™s, 
with the anxiety around atomic bombs, Hollywood, no
t religion or 

 8pseudoscience, provided the apocalyptic imagery, as
 giant insects and reptiles 
in black and white, always enlarged and made danger
ous by some exposure to 
radioactivity, stomped over our cities and ate up o
ur populace. Knowing this 
history, I say this: expressing worry in strong lan
guage and apocalyptic story 
line is almost a predictable American pastime. 

 
Thus, the mistrust bred by the present age will nat
urally elicit strong reactions. 
One will say ?I am just not voting, because my anxi
ety asks ‚What™s the 
point?™? Another says, ?The world is so unfair and 
cruel now, let the whole 
thing be utterly destroyed!?     

 
But there is another response to anxiety, which is 
one of vision, virtue, 
community and care. 

 
To be a part of this congregation, for example, is 
to be part of an educational 
and spiritual community which 
recognizes 
the dramatic changes of our time, 
but, instead of hiding out in stomach-churning worr
y or apocalyptic fantasy, 
bids us hold close to a liberating vision which hel
ps us to resist the 
dehumanizing power and principalities of our era. O
ur heritage asks us to 
humanize ourselves, that is, to become more human, 
not less, more shaped by 
our vision than our worries, more subjects than obj
ects, more faithful than 
cynical.  Rebecca Parker presents Paolo Friere™s in
sights, with perfect and 
inescapable simplicity: to educate ourselves to be 
more human is ?to practice 
freedom.?  Or practice liberty, in Bolivar™s phrase
. 
  

?We are fully human,? she says, ?anytime we move to
wards possibilities of 
fuller and richer life individually and collectivel
y.? 
 
Yes, collectively, in community. To do it alone is 
to risk egotism, she says. She 
defines dehumanization this way: ?to be dehumanized
 is to be cut 
off
 from 
experiencing the world.? The present era is dehuman
izing precisely because it 
doesn™t permit us to experience the world direclty.
 We are simply 
told
 what the 
world is. 

Muslims are all violent, the pundits tell us. So do
n™t meet them face-to-face and 
experience otherwise. Blacks are like this, Jews ar
e like this, you know, wink, 
wink, gay men think this way, all Christians everyw
here are like this or that. 
This is all the language of dehumanization, the lan
guage that changes the 

 9oxygen we breathe into an atmosphere of fear, the l
anguage that robs us of our 
capacity to experience people directly. In Friere™s
 words: ?The dehumanized 
are submerged in the world, passively shaped, contr
olled, determined, and used 
for the purposes of others Œ but they are not activ
e in the world.? 
 
David Richo on the other hand, dares to depict a be
autiful way of being active 
in the world, hard as the world is these days. He i
nsists that we not only can 
resist 
being 
controlled, we can resist trying to grab control of
 others. He refers 
to this kind of life, like the Chinese teacher Kung
, or Confucius before him, as 
living a life of 
virtue.
 Bringing that word from China to the West, he poin
ts out 
that the Hebrew word we translate as 
virtue
 actually means 
steps
, and I think 
that is a wise metaphor.  

 
Educated in virtue by our Unitarian Universalist co
mmunity, we choose to be 
humanized, step by step. Some of the steps we take 
toward humanization 
consist simply in our resistance to, and critique o
f, the systems that dehumanize 
us. In the words of Dr. Richo: 
?I am no longer under the blinding influence of 
the four main streets that direct so many attitudes
 and lifestyles:  Madison 
Avenue, Tin Pan Alley, Wall Street and Hollywood Bo
ulevard.?
  But he also 
describes spiritual work of a more affirmative natu
re, i.e. ?I am not caught up 
in regret or self-reproach because of my mistakes i
n life.? Or, ?My question is 
not ‚What can I get away with?™ but ‚What is the ri
ght thing to do?™? Richo, in 
his remarkable list of affirmations, offers us a cl
ear vision of what it means to 
be authentically and virtuously human, not manipula
tive, but engaged; not 
defensive, but willing to learn; not despairing, bu
t trusting that human beings 
working together to make the world more just is not
 hopeless, but the very 
substance of hope. Not bullying, arrogant or superi
or, but willing to let people 
have the time they need to do the work they need to
 do to come to their own 
decisions. Not blaming or dismissive, but self-refl
ective and accountable. 
 
I am convinced that such a vision is central to pro
gressive religious living in 
the modern world. Faithfulness to living that visio
n in our day-to-day lives IS 
the liberation we speak about; it is both the found
ation and the ground-floor of 
any structure of justice we hope to raise in the wo
rld. 
 
Devere was right. We live in a world where promises
 are broken daily, 
bombast is ordinary, lies disguise themselves as tr
uth, and many people do 

 10
things publicly which undercut our willingness to t
rust at all. Worry and 
anxiety about all of this is very real, and sometim
es as dramatic as the end of 
the world. 

 
But that does not mean I have given up. In Richo™s 
words: 
My work on myself 
has made me more conscious of the politics and stre
sses of the world around 
me.  I question authority while affirming, praying 
and working for an end to 
war, retaliation, greed, hate and ignorance.  This 
is based on the fact that I 
have not given up on believing in the possibility o
f transformation for every 
person, political and religious leader and nation. 

 
And, I need add, myself. I too need transformation.
 I need to be transformed 
from a man who felt so righteous about his long hel
d convictions about voting 
and civic duty, that he came to think that if he wa
s huffy and outraged enough, 
it would be enough to bully a good friend into subm
ission, and thus, to vote. 
But such an approach, I have learned from our readi
ngs this morning–and for 
that matter, from Jesus, Siddartha Buddha, Rumi, an
d Confucius, is 
dehumanizing, not humanizing. I dehuman-ized Devere
. And myself. 
 
After preparing this sermon, when I next saw Devere
, I gave him my usual 
loving embrace, friend to friend. And I told him th
at he would feature in 
today™s sermon. ?It™s what happens when you™re frie
nds with a 
minister–you™re sermon fodder, day in, day out. But
 don™t worry,? I said to 
him, ?the sermon is not about 
your
 struggles and decisions; those are yours to 
make, and you take all the time you need to make th
em. The sermon reflects on 
me. I think I tried to make you think and feel like
 I do by withholding my usual 
affection for you. I wasn™t so much respecting your
 feelings and wrestling as 
defending my own, and poorly at that. I still think
 it™s important for me to vote.  
And I can tell you what my process has been over th
e years to come to that 
steady decision. But I am not going to dehumanize y
ou–and thus myself– 
again, by expecting you to think, and feel, just li
ke I do.? 
 
Now, I think I learned something important through 
all this. About virtue. 
About anxiety. About liberation. And about myself. 
  
 11
The conversation finally ended, as usual, with Deve
re and I entering into 
banter, and then word-play, and then jokes; and the
n I almost fell to the floor 
laughing.  

 
But then you knew that would happen, didn™t you? Af
ter all, I told you right off 
the bat, ?My friend Devere is a funny guy.? 

 
Offering 

 
Roses for a Late Summer Day 

 
Roses have roots. So do you. So do I. 

Roses have thorns. So do you. So do I. 

Roses have color. So do you. So do I. 

Roses blossom. So do you. So do I. 

 
Roses are mortal. So are you. So am I. 

Roses are teachers. Sometimes we are too. 

But today, let™s be students instead. 

 
Roses root themselves in the deep earth, 

not in shallow worry, or easy anxiety. 

Roses do not imagine controlling 

the plants around them, 

nor do they fret when they don™t get their way. 

Roses don™t fear comets in the sky, 

or worms at their root. 

They simply get on with budding, 

and blossoming. 

O Rose, may you blossom before us. 

May we blossom before you. 

May we blossom together.
