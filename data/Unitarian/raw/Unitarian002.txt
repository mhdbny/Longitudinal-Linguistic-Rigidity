  "Are these terrorists truly forces of evil, who simply hate freedom and the
  American way of life? Or are they not victims themselves, whose leaders and
  fathers and brothers have been fighting for a cause in which they have been
  swallowed up, defending a homeland they fear is being stolen unjustly by
  forces and governments over which they have no control? And what would we
  do when faced with such hopelessness and despair? And rage?

  "Have we learned nothing in Sarajevo, in Jerusalem, in Belfast? When will
  it end? How much more suffering and horror and inhumanity can the human race
  inflict upon itself?"

  "We can build up a few defenses, we can raid and bomb a few terrorist training
  camps, and in our own rage and self-righteousness, we can crucify and create
  martyrs of a few self-destructive souls. But in doing so, we fan the flames
  of hatred and despair, and give strength and resolve to those who align
  themselves against us and our way of life. We are only guaranteeing the
  perpetuation of our own suffering and despair."
