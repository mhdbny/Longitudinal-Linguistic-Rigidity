Along the Way, Joy   
Mark Belletini 

 
Opening Words:
  
We are here 

in a strangely warm winter, 

gathered in a house of praise, set like a jewel 

between a busy street and a muddy river, 

to worship, to return to our deeper affirmations 

and fortify ourselves for the justice work 

and soul work that center our good community. 

And so once again we begin by declaring: 

 
As we move through this year of transition and joy,
 we remember with 
gratitude the power of our living heritage, which m
oves through time 
like a clear running creek; refreshing us with the 
sweet draughts of 
courage, hope, justice making, peaceful living, eve
r deeper honesty, and 
more truthful loving. And so we kindle this light w
ith thanksgiving–
  
Communing 
 The
 Sequence for the Day 
 
The silence is often not quite silent, is it? 

There are always those noisy worries 

whispering loudly in the corner of the mind: 

My aging parents; what can I do? 

Those I love who crumple from addictions; 

how can I be there for them? 

How do I know when to say yes,  

when to say no? 

The silence is often not quite silent, is it? 

There are always those noisy questions 

whispering loudly in the corner of my heart: 

How do people no different from me become homeless 
and sleep on steps 
at the bus station? 

How do nursing home workers pay their rent? 

 2 How is it possible to fear being honest? 

The silence is never quite silent, is it? 

For some Russian Orthodox immigrants in Pretoria, S
outh Africa, today is 
both Christmas and a lovely summer™s day–I bet the 
bells are ringing 
loudly. 

 
For other Russian Jewish immigrants in Columbus Ohi
o, today is not 
Christmas, just a warm winter™s day for a bike ride
 along the Olentangy 
River bike path–I bet the fast brown waters are chu
rning noisily against 
the muddy banks. 

 
The silence is never quite silent, is it? 

 
It never seems to be. 

 
And yet it is not without joy that I approach the s
ilence, for in the 
sanctuary of the safe and silent heart, even the qu
estions, the wonderings 
and the sound of bells and waters can bring healing
- 
 
silence 

 
Indeed, in every heart there is a room, a sanctuary
 safe and strong, where 
love may offer its hand to care and concern, where 
the memory of a loved 
one, a suffering friend, or tender face may be name
d, welcomed and 
embraced for a time, like a placeholder amid our bu
sy lives. Whispering 
their names aloud or cradling them in silence, we r
emember them. 
 
silence 

 
And so it goes, and so we go along our way, 

serenaded from sound to silence, from worry 

to wonder, from bells to blessing, by music. 

 
Readings
  
The First Reading
 comes from Brita Stendahl, 

 3 who with her husband Krister, was a major presence 
at the Harvard 
Divinity School during the seventies and eighties. 
She is talking about a 
Sabbatical they took during their career, back to t
heir native Uppsala, 
Sweden, where she began work on the book, Sabbatica
l Reflections
, and 
where her husband also planned on writing a book, a
 biblical commentary. 
 
What became of our sabbatical? Was it just another 
time in which we 
traveled and rested, ate and drank, read and wrote 
and filled the 
wastebasket? Was it a success or a failure? 

 
We were back in Uppsala on May 1st, Krister eager t
o get back to work on 
his commentary. We rented two student rooms in orde
r to make the last 
stretch so he could return with a manuscript. 

 
On May 15, he called me into his study, and I knew 
right away, from the 
manner in which he asked me, that he had something 
significant to say. 
Then he told me he had come to the conclusion that 
he should scrap his 
work on his commentary. I didn™t know what to say. 
He had worked for 
many years on this project. The sabbatical had begu
n in hope of fulfilling 
that obligation.  

 
At first I felt thunderstruck. Was this not a defea
t? All that labor in vain.  
But he was no longer sorry. Rather, the decision to
 scrap the project 
relieved him. 

 
The Second Reading
 comes from the pen of German playwright, poet and 
philosopher, Friedrich von Schiller in his Philosop
hical Letters, 1786 
 Love is the most beautiful phenomenon in all the so
ulful world, the 
unfailing gravity of the spiritual world, the sourc
e of devotion and the most 
sublime virtueŠLove is the attraction of the excell
ent.
  
When I cease to love, that is, when I hate, I take 
something away from 
myself; when I love, I become so much the richer. F
orgiveness is the 
recovery of an alienated property. Hatred, on the o
ther hand, is sort of 
prolonged dying, and by one™s own hand at that; whi
le self-absorption 

 4 remains the greatest poverty a human being can know
.  
 
Sermon
  
Just thinking of a first sentence in a sermon that 
follows five months of 
sabbatical time left me perplexed for hours. The im
ages that I bring with 
me into this pulpit literally crowd behind my eyeli
ds. The time was so rich, 
so full. 

 
I could spend an hour or two just trying to capture
 my five day visit to 
New York™s electric Manhattan, where I walked alone
, late on its 
humming September streets, taking in the lights on 
a balmy midnight. 
 
Or I could talk about going to the Whitney Museum t
he next day, to see 
that very scene seemingly depicted in advance by on
e of my favorite North 
American artists, Edward Hopper, whose paintings fi
lled the entire top 
floor of the museum. Oh, I could have spent a month
 in the Whitney 
easily, drinking in Hopper™s amazing style, yes, bu
t also gulping down 
more contemporary art, like Christian Marclay™s min
d-blowing 
Video 
Quartet,
 a thirteen-minute musical composition in four move
ments made 
up entirely of clips from the movies. As an artist 
myself, I was as joyous in 
those days as it is, I think, possible to be. 

 
And as a cook, I could also spend an hour describin
g the incredible meals I 
had while on sabbatical too, such as at Mario Batal
i™s Roman restaurant in 
New York, Lupa, where I had the best single Italian
 meal of my 
life–sorry, grandma. Or dining on perfect potato ra
violi with my godson 
Ben in Sacramento, while conversing with the owner,
 Biba Gaggiano, 
whose family also, like mine, came from the Emilia 
area of Italy. So much 
pleasure for a man who loves to cook, like me. 

 
So before I get lost in a thousand details, let me 
focus my comments a little 
more sharply.  I want to begin exploring my sabbati
cal time with you by 
circling a single day among the 150 odd days I was 
away. 
 
It was the day after Thanksgiving–a warm Friday, so
me of you may 

 5 remember, a shirt-sleeve day. I was down at Schille
r Park, here in 
Columbus, in German Village. I was taking a joyful 
walk with two of my 
friends, visiting from Pittsburgh for the holiday, 
my colleague David 
McFarland, his partner Tim Nuttle, and their foster
-baby, Jaden. 
 
It™s wonderful to have these two as close as Pittsb
urgh. Some of you may 
remember I had visited them in Germany three years 
ago, back when they 
were living in the very charming city of Jena, wher
e they were taking 
classes at Schiller University. So naturally, I tho
ught they might especially 
enjoy Schiller Park. And especially the translation
s of Schiller quotations 
cast in bronze along the pavement of a looping path
 in the west gardens of 
the park.  

 
Both David and Tim were fluent in German, so as I h
eld young Jaden, they 
retranslated Schiller™s pithy quotes in a decidedly
 dated form of German, 
and debated their meaning, giving the sayings in th
e walkway sometimes 
very different meaning. And as they did, and we str
olled and stopped along 
the way, I mused on my own sabbatical learnings. 

 
Jedes neve auch das glück frschreckt
. Everything new, even a blessing, 
strikes fear. 

 
It was interesting to me how it started off, my sab
batical.  At first, it felt so 
good just to catch up on sleep, to dine at regular 
suppertimes at real tables, 
to be able to call friends and say, ?I™ll be right 
over.?  The unstructured 
time, the days suddenly free of deadlines. I can wo
rk on my book when I 
want to, I thought. Even at two in the morning if I
 want to, since I can 
sleep in till noon. I can read for idiosyncratic pl
easure, instead of having to 
prepare for the next week™s commitments. What a ble
ssing, I thought. 
What a blessing. 

 
And yet Schiller was right. In the midst of all thi
s freed up time, I had to 
wrestle with discomfort, a kind of fear. I found I 
actually 
missed
 the 
deadlines, the structures, the juggling. These had 
been shaping my life for 
almost thirty years. To be without them for five mo
nths–what would 
happen to me? Would I find inner motivation, fresh 
disciplines? After all, 

 6 my work-life deadlines were regular, reliable. Sund
ay services and 
Wednesday Board meetings arrive as if on a conveyor
 belt that never shuts 
off. My schedule never changed. But everything was 
new on sabbatical. 
Scarily unstructured. I began to wonder. Did I miss
 these deadlines 
because their very reliability disguises change, so
 that I actually live with 
less fear when I have deadlines than when I do not?
  
But after worrying about this for a while, I realiz
ed I had to agree with 
Schiller again:  
Die zeit bringt rat
–it™s only time that brings wisdom. And 
so I decided to wait for time to pass to see if my 
fear abated and I could 
proceed with my plans. 

 
But the thing with life is that it neither knows no
r cares about sabbaticals, 
and does not schedule anything based on whether you
 are fearful or not. 
 
So during my sabbatical, things I could not have im
agined at all before my 
sabbatical, came my way during my sabbatical. The b
est made plans, it 
would appear, are mostly provisional. 

 
First, there™s what I wrote about in my newsletter,
 about creating a family 
relationship–father and son, with a young man name 
Tony Hess. He lives 
with his partner in Albuquerque now, but we speak o
r visit daily via 
computer, often face to face because of cameras. I™
ll unpack that in a 
sermon down the line, but believe me, on the first 
day of my sabbatical, I 
never imagined that someone would be calling me Bab
bo, or Dad, at the 
end of my sabbatical, nor is it something I had lon
ged for or wanted for a 
long time.  

 
Second. After being invited by a kind man to visit 
the local temple, or 
gurdwara, of the Sikh religion, I became so fascina
ted that I decided to 
make a major study of that religion. It™s the fifth
 largest on earth, and one 
with a very beautiful scripture. I will talk about 
that part of my sabbatical 
in a sermon to come. But believe me, I hadn™t plann
ed to do any such 
thing. 

 
Third. I befriended two homeless people and I maint
ain those friendships 

 7 today despite the differences in our lives, our cul
ture, our vocabularies. 
Both of them are moving toward 

better days, I am glad to say. 

 
Fourth. I visited–every week– another friend who we
nt to jail for 
reasons entirely due to substance abuse, with which
 our so-called justice 
system is little prepared to cope because it is so 
poorly funded, although I 
must commend local judge John O™Conner for throwing
 the whole cog of 
his being into the wheel of the system as often as 
he can. I watched him 
sentence people one day while on my sabbatical, and
 I have never scene 
better justice served in all the ten times I served
 jury duty. But the very 
idea that we actually 
jail
 addicts, or imprison the mentally ill reminds me 
of the understandably derided idea of debtors™ pris
on from merry old 
England. ?We™ll let you out of jail when you have p
aid in full.? Right. And 
in our day, a day no more enlightened than they wer
e back then, we tell 
people who are caught in a whole system of substanc
e abuse that a few 
years in prison will 
teach them a lesson.  
I have to wonder– what kind of 
lesson can be learned by five months in jail follow
ed by nothing except 
simple release–which usually happens, I kid you not
, at two or three in 
the morning at a place without a busline or taxis? 

  

A young friend of mine was surprised that I went to
 the jail every week. Or 
had homeless friends. He wondered why a man in a pr
ofession like mine 
might engage with people so different from him. I s
aid to him, ?Not all 
that different. They both breathe. Just like me.? A
fter all, I preach the 
virtues of Love, Compassion and Kindness ever week 
in this pulpit. And 
as Schiller puts it so compactly along the way, in 
the park named after 
him, 
Jewede tugend ist fleckfrei bis au den augenblick d
er probe
–all 
virtues are credible until they are tested. And bes
ides, friends are friends, 
are they not? And again Schiller reminded us along 
the way, 
Und die treve 
sie ist doch kein leerer wahn
–loyalty is NOT an empty vision. 
 
Or, in language even more direct, Schiller wrote a 
passage not to be found 
along the park path, but one which you heard in the
 second reading, from 
his philosophical writings, 
When I cease to love, that is, when I hate, I take 
something away from 

 8 myself; when I love, I become so much the richer.
 Hatred, on the other 
hand, is sort of prolonged dying, and by one™s own 
hand at that; while 
self-absorption remains the greatest poverty a huma
n being can know.
  
 
These are powerful words. 

 
And this love he lionizes must, in order to be real
, move toward people 
who are different from me, who are not ?like-minded
? or ?equally lucky.? 
One of my homeless friends also has a kind of menta
l illness that helps to 
keep him on the streets and away from the normal wo
rkplace. I do not 
suffer from that mental illness, by genetic luck, I
 guess. Yet I like the soul 
of this man, and enjoy our conversations about his 
real feelings and 
interesting analyses of his situation.  He seems li
ke a very good man. A 
decent fellow. After all, as Schiller confirms alon
g the way in his rather 
antique German, 
Redicheit gedeiht in jeden stande–
 You can find a 
certain decency in everyone. 

 
Now, of course, visiting someone in jail does not s
trike many people as 
being as joyous as going out to dinner or knowing e
cstasy in great 
museums.  Or doing whatever brings you joy easily, 
say, watching the 
game tomorrow night, or going dancing or working a 
puzzle. Or, say, 
flying up to Chicago–which I also did, to take my e
ldest godson Adam 
out to the opera for his 30
th
 birthday. The opera was 
Salome
, the perfect 
singer was Deborah Voight, the sets were just about
 as astonishingly 
beautiful as could be expected. I™ve known and love
d Adam since I first 
held him in my arms as a newborn. And the joy I fee
l, simply being with 
him and his uplifting friends, leaves me almost exh
austed with joy. How 
lucky can a man get? 

 
Yet on my sabbatical, I learned that watching my fr
iend Dewey dig into 
his own soul, an act I can see visibly through the 
thick and scratched glass 
of our awful Columbus jail (voted, I hear, second w
orst in the whole 
country), and when I hear him weep for his life, or
 laugh at the absurdity 
of his situation, that™s joy too. And how lucky can
 a man get to care for 
someone who is finding himself so clearly, gladly a
nd completely, 
despite 
the awfulness of our justice system and its plentif
ul obstacles to real 

 9 healing. 

 
How much more joy can I know, than to show up for a
 friend? Thirty 
years, or one year, makes a difference in intensity
, perhaps.  But this joy is 
just as truly joy as the first. Different, perhaps,
 but just as true. And just as 
redemptive to my soul. Because on sabbatical, I lea
rned that I am not 
going to wait around for redemption, as our Swedish
 poet wrote in the 
affirmation. I am not going to desire it. To find t
he joy hidden in the 
difficult, as well as that proclaimed by the sublim
e, is to be redeemed 
already. After all, as Schiller expresses along the
 way, 
Ewig is die freude. 
Joy is ageless. 

 
Now, yes, you may remind me that I did have plans t
o write a book, a book 
filled with the kinds of prayers and meditations I 
write every Sunday to 
lead us into silence, or to preface a song.  And I 
didn™t finish that book. 
Oh, I worked on it some, did some initial rearrangi
ng and editing. Pushed 
verses here and there. But I am nowhere near comple
tion. 
 
But I am somehow relieved, as the professor in our 
first reading was. 
Relieved not to have finished the book. Unlike him,
 I have not given up 
working on the book–I still am working on it. But a
t my pace. Within the 
contexts of deadlines and work pressures, within th
e actual context of my 
writing, which is preparation for worship when I am
 not on sabbatical. I 
am not, after all, a Thoreau type who would enjoy w
riting out in a cabin in 
the woods. I™m afraid that is the romantic image of
 the writer that dogged 
my tracks while on sabbatical. But that is simply n
ot how I write. I write 
best in the middle of things, after a good meal, af
ter being entranced by a 
sunlit piece by Edward Hopper in a big museum in a 
crowded city, or after 
a computer chat with my son, or a visit to Dewey be
hind glass at the jail, 
that I have to fit in between a hospital call and B
READ meeting. Or after a 
walk with friends, late on a Saturday night, when I
 realize that the purpose 
of the sabbatical in the end is not to go through i
t and leave it behind me, 
but to take its riches with me into the work I love
, in the congregation I 
both love and serve. Here™s where I will write. Her
e is the diving board 
that quivers beneath my feet as I dare to risk the 
plunge into a deeper 
loving, a more redemptive joy.  

 10
  
So thanks for all that you did so excellently to ma
ke this church thrive 
while I was gone. It was humming beautifully as I r
e-entered the door, as I 
had very real faith that it would. And I suspect yo
u, too, have a few 
sabbatical stories to tell. For your lives and my o
wn were indeed lived 
separately for a while. And so I can only believe t
hat each of you, too, may 
have discovered, through experience or study, some 
things about your 
lives that may prove to be your redemption, your sa
lvation, your life™s true 
joy.  

 
But now our lives are flowing back together again. 
And we have things to 
do. So let™s get going. 

 
Blessing Prayer 

 
Joy, not contentment. Not satisfaction, O Love. 

Something a tad more dangerous, more risky. 

A deeper happiness, one that does not even count so
me unhappiness as an 
enemy but an ally. A creative power. A healing powe
r, O Love. Something 
a lot like you, in fact. Amen. 

 
Come now, and let us make symphony together. 

 
Schiller/Beethoven™s Ode to Joy
