ve Learned about Liberal Religious 
Values While Serving as an Elected 
Representative in Kentucky

Greeting  Centering Kindling
 
 
Opening
 
(please rise)
 
 
We are here
 
 
after days of gray and rain
 
 
to worship, that is, to sail not to drift,
 
 
to question not to deny,
 
 
to praise, not take for granted, 
 
 
and to yield to the healing power of love,
 
 
rather than 
surrender to fear.
 
 
And so, we pledge to journey together along 

the ways of truth and affection, as best as we 
can name them now, or may learn them in 
days to come; that we and our children may 
be fulfilled, and that we may speak to our 
world in words and 
lives of peace, justice and 
goodwill.
 
 
Sequence:
 
 
It makes no difference, ultimately, 
 
whether one has roots in Zambia, or England, 
 

mortal. All who are alive are just that, alive. 
 
All share one earth not two. 
 
 
It makes no difference, ultimately, 
 
whether one has roots in a large family or
 
a small one, a loud family or a silent one,
 
a conservative church or a liberal synagogue,
 

 
we still have to make decisions in our life
 
ba
sed on principal, not reaction. We still have
 
to face dangers, and still not reject the gift of 
joy. We still have to negotiate ambiguity.
 
 

It makes no difference, ultimately,
 
whether one feels first or thinks first,
 
whether one can leap across the facts a
nd
 
intuit, or whether one goes through the
 
world meticulously. We are still each and
 
all called to share responsibility for the
 
common good. We are each called to
 
find ways to communicate even when its 
 
difficult. We are each called to pay attention
 
to the
 
silence that glues all of our words,
 
and all of the stars for that matter, into
 

 
 
silence
 
 
It makes no difference how different we are
 
when it comes to the reality of our communion,
 
each of us bound to the other i
n love, or by 
worry, or by conflict or by memory.
 
Taking the particulars of our own lives
 
away from the universality of our ultimate
 
concern, we are free here to remember our
 
friends, loved ones, families, personal
 
mentors, children, ancestors, whose faces
 
rise before us at this time, and thank them
 

for helping us to be in this moment by
 

 

 
 
naming
 
 
It makes no difference whether we sing
 

 
are no c
ultures exempt from the human
 
circle to which we all belong. Let us rejoice
 
that we are alive with song!
 
 
 
Readings:
 
 
The First Reading
 
is in two parts:
 
both can be 
found on the back of this very Order of 
Celebration, this week and every week; the first 
se
t of words are a composite of written by
 
several members of the congregation, including
 
the ministers and the religious education 
directors over the last ten years.
 
The second part 
is our own Mission Statement, created by 
ourselves over an entire year, wit
h many voices 
combined into one statement of mission and 

purpose.
 
 

to everyone of good will, regardless of age, 
ability, gender, ethnicity, color, sexual or 
affectional orientation, or class. We agree to b
e 
together, not believe together.
 
 
 
Together, we mutually re
-
create this beloved 
community, as we work to practice our stated 
mission in our lives, community and the world:
 
 
 
 
We are here:
 
 
 
·
     
 
To learn and practice true hospitality
 
·
     
 
To revere th
e reasoning mind and the generous 
heart
 
·
     
 
To claim our diversity as a source of our 
strength, and
 
·
     
 
To relinquish the safety of our unexamined 
privilege for the freedom to engage in 
transforming justice
 
 
 

The Second Reading
 
comes from the book 
Bl

writings by Rebecca Parker, edited by Rob

vacation Bible school one June singing:
 
 
Jesus loves me this I know,
 
For the Bible tells me so.
 
Little ones to him
 
belong,
 
They are weak and he is strong.
 
 
 
My mother stopped my singing. I got the distinct 
impression she would prefer that I never sing 
that song again. When I became an adult, I asked 
my mother 

 
who is, after all, the daughter and 
wife of Methodist min
isters 

 
what her objection 

taught to believe something just because the 
Bible said so. They should form their own 
religious thoughts from their experiences.

it 
always will be, because there is evil out there 
in the world. The world is also difficult because 
it is competitive. There will always be winners

Rev. and Rep. (D) Kelly Flood
 
 
 
 

 
UU parish minister, professional fundraiser for 
Starr King School, and a Democr
atic state rep 
from Lexington, KY.
 
 
Let me tell you a bit about myself first.
 
 

I was raised Roman Catholic, and discovered 
Unitarian Universalism in my mid
-

 
when I started to attend the congregation Mark
 
used to serve in Hayward, CA.
 
 
I was looking for
 
faith to affirm my feminist 

encouraged. And, I was looking for a community 
where a multi
-
faith relationship with my 
husband, a Jewish man, would be respected.
 
 
I went to Starr King School, like Mark and Eric,
 
and was ordained and called by the Lexington 
KY congregation. 
 
 
After 7 years, I went on to serve as the 
Development person at our seminary in 
Berkeley CA, Starr King School for the 
Ministry.
 
 

a politician! 
 
 
 
Let me illustrate the changes in my life this way.
 

When I was a parish minister, and I was out at
 
at a restaurant, a person would see me, buy me
 
a drink, and then come and tell me the whole 
story of their life.
 
 
When I became a fundraiser, someone might
 
buy 
me a drink, but when I told them I what
 
I do for a living, they would just get up, go away
 
and I would never see them again.
 
 
Now that I am a politician, folks see me in
 
a restaurant, buy me a drink and then come up
 


 
 

demonic, at best, by discouraged modern men
 
and women? 
 
 
I do it because my public service is rooted in my 
liberal religious values.
 
 
Among those values that I cherish is a strong 
sense of stewardship 

 
w
here generosity and 
strategic choices shape lives toward connecting, 
meaning and purpose

pragmatism

Why? Because our very way of life may depend 
upon it.
 
*************************
 
As you ask one another to commit your hard
-
earned dollars to fairly pay your ministers, fully 
fund your healing, transformative programs, 
carefully tend to your building and
 
grounds, and 
meet your fair share of commitments to the 
larger UU world, and to the Columbus 
community, I want to encourage you to 
remember that how you understand this 
conversation of commitment, how you frame it, 
matters. Matters a lot.
 
How you frame th
ings impacts our goals, plans, 
the way we act, and even the results of our 
actions.
 

How we frame things is often a form of what we 

 
How may here are members since 2000? (note: 
about a third raised their hands) Since 2005? 
(note
: another third)
 
By coming here, by choosing this place, you 
have chosen a 
liberal 
religious worldview:  
humanists and heretics rejected the image of 
God 

 
or the ultimate presence of Love 

 
as a 
cruel father who demanded the suffering of his 
only son on t
he cross.
 
You are linked to Universalists like Hosea 
Ballou, who in his 18
th
 
century Treatise on 
Atonement, denounced that God 

 
the great 
Jehovah 

 
was his term 

 
a God who would call 
for the endless misery of a whole portion of 
humankind just to appease 
his anger.
 
Ballou understood that how people imagine 
God, how they frame the image of the Holy, or 
if you will, fram what is of ultimate worth in 
life, influences the social structures we create, 
and how we ourselves behave. 
 

The modern
-
day political scien
tist and linguist, 
George Lakoff, understands this too.
 
In a recent article in the New York Times he 

not being discussed. At stake is the moral basis 

 
And the central issue is how co
nservatives and 
liberals name or frame their worldview. 
 
And no matter where you find yourself on the 
political spectrum, we are in the habit of framing 
our national discourse 

 
just as we often do our 
religious discourse 

 
in terms of 
family. 
 
We speak of
 
nations (and our congregations) as 
families first. 
 
Why does this matter?
 
Because of the radical differences with which 
religious conservatives and religious liberals 
understand what a healthy, productive, 
prosperous family looks and acts like.
 

Let me exp
lain; and please remember therese 
generalizations, points on the continuum, not 
absolutes. Here I am using Lakoff: 
 

family where the father is The Decider, the 
ultimate moral authority in the family. 
 
 
His
 
authority must not be challenged. His job is 
to protect the family, to support the family (by 
winning competitions in the marketplace), and to 
teach his kids right from wrong by disciplining 
them physically when they do wrong.The use of 
force is necessary
 
and required. 
 
Only then will children develop the internal 
discipline to become moral beings. And only 
with such discipline will they be able to prosper. 
 
And what of people who are not prosperous? 
 
They don't have discipline, and without 
discipline they
 
cannot be moral, so they deserve 

 
The 
good
 
people are hence the 
prosperous 
people. 
 

Helping others takes away their discipline, and 
hence makes them both unable to prosper on 
their own and function morally.
 
An example of this from my home 
state of 
Kentucky.
 

Republican Rep. Lonnie Napier. The bill  
mandates that people on food stamps be tested 
for drugs before receiving the stamps. 
 
This idea caught fire 
--
 

who are defrauding goo
d, taxpaying people by 
spending their money on drugs and getting by on 
food stamps, is a crime.
 
I pointed out on the floor that if we are actually 
that concerned about fraud, then we need to 

corporations receiving 
millions in tax credits 
annually from our state government!
 

itself is seen as both natural (since it is assumed 
that people naturally seek their self
-
interest) and 

moral (if everyone seeks their own profit, the 
pr
ofit of all will be maximized). 
 

moral authority, there should be no power higher 
than the market, and none that might go against 

 
Thus the government can spend money to 
protect the market and
 
promote market values, 
but should not rule over it either through (1) 
regulation, (2) taxation, (3) unions and worker 
rights, (4) environmental protection or food 
safety laws, and (5) tort cases. 
 
Moreover, government should not do public 
service. The mar
ket has service industries for 
that.
 
Thus, it would be wrong for the government to 
provide health care, education, public 
broadcasting, public parks and so on. 
 
No one should be paying for anyone else. It is 
individual responsibility in all arenas. 
 

Taxati
on is thus seen as taking money away 
from those who have earned it and giving it to 

 
Taxation cannot be seen 

 
as liberally minded 
voters may claim 

 
as providing the necessities 
of life for a civilized society, and for busines
s to 
prosper.

with individual, not social, 
responsibilities, and without any government 
authority telling you what you can and cannot 
do. 
 
To defend that freedom as an individual, you

values, found in the heart of the reading from 
Rebecca Parker.
 

government as a nurturing parent who raises 
their children 
to not so much be obedient as 
open minded;
 



 
The nurturing
-
parent worldview assumes the 
world, despite its dangers and difficulties, is 
basically good, but
 
t
hat it can 
be made better; 

for the betterment of our world.
 
Thus, parents, whether mothers or fathers, are 

know empathy (caring for how others feel) and 
r
esponsibility (for on
eself and others).
 
Remember the brouhaha when President Obama

quality.
 
We are libe
ral religious people 

 
we are the ones 
who deem what is holy in life to be grounded in 
love; 
 
we are the ones
 
who value freely entered 
covenants over strict contracts and creeds; we

independent 

self
-
reliance; we are the ones who deem the 
market as a means to the end, which is to build 
better communities and greater justice for all, 
especially the most vulnerable of us.
 
The role of government to liberal religious 
people is to provide 
an infrastructure of services 
that support empathy, responsibility, fairness, 
freedom, trust, transparency.
 
From these values, specific policies follow: 
social safety nets and government regulations to 
stem greed; universal education for all; 
protection of
 
civil liberties for everyone and 
access to our court system for everyone, not 
matter their income; and the promotion of an 
economy that spreads profits and benefits 
throughout the workforce, ensuring all are

And taxes? They are the dues you pay to live in 
such a civilized society.
 
***********************
 

Why highlight these differences here on 
stewardship Sunday?
 
Not to favor one over the other, though I surely 
have a bias.
 

that by showing up 
here on Sundays,
 
y
ou do have a stake in the 
outcome of liberal religious values in our larger 
world.
 

peace of mind, rejuvenation of spirit, 
t
hough 
surely that matters. Taking care of one

personal health and well being is a necessary 

that involved in a congregation like this.
 
I want to emphasize that as a UU in a religiously 
conservative state like KY, I more fully 
understand why our churc
hes matter. And matter 
a lot.
 
There is a battle of worldviews playing out in 
our country, where the most recent theatre is the 
good state of Wisconsin. There, tens of 
thousands citizens are defying the conservative 

frames put forth by the Governor and are 
willing 
to flood the streets of their capital to stand up for 
what they understand: that democracy is about 
citizens uniting to take care of each other, about 
social responsibility as well as individual 
responsibility, and about work 
-
 
not just for your 
ow
n profit, but to help create a civilized society. 
 
They appreciate their teachers, nurses, firemen, 
police and other public servants. They are 
flooding the streets to demand democracy rooted 

values of a democracy
 
grounded in care for the 
stranger in our midst, the immigrant to our 
shores, of democracy rooted in social 
responsibility and in excellence, where 
prosperity is to be shared by those who work and 
those who serve.
 
Your church is making a difference in the 
everyday lives of each of you 

 
the children in 
your midst, the citizens of Columbus who know 
this to be a place where people of many likes 

hospitality, revere the reasoning mind and 
generous heart, claim 
diversity as a source of 

strength, and relinquish the safety of our 
unexamined privilege for the freedom to engage 
in transforming justice.
 
In the days ahead, as you make your 
commitment to fund these values from your 

generously than you thought possible to pay for 
the people and programs that are here for you 

 
and for Columbus and the larger world.
 

for a congregation, community and country 
where empathy 

 
citizens caring f
or one another 

 
and personal and social responsibility
--
 
shape 
how we govern ourselves. 
 
And in the days ahead, as you benefit from the 
fruits of a successful canvass, may this 
congregation embrace righteous anger and 
courage, for what the ancient Christi
an 
theologian Augustine named as the two beautiful 
daughters of hope: 
 
Righteous anger that things are the way they are. 
Courage to make them the way they ought to be.
 
 

May it be so.
 
 
Offering
 
 
We who have been blest with this place
 
now may choose to bless
 
it.
 
We who have been blest with our lives
 
now may choose to live with gratitude
 
for those lives by sharing the responsibility
 
for this our common house of spirit.
 
By electronic means of the modern era,
 
or by the ancient spiritual practice of the 
offering,
 
we give and bless. 
 
 
Words of Commissioning of our Stewards
 
 
Will those among us who have trained to be
 
stewards during the following month please 
come forward?
 
 
The word steward is a very old English word,
 

 
of
 
the vision of this home for our spirit, a vision
 
of welcome and reason, a vision of dignity and
 
care, a vision of abundant, not stingy love.
 

 
These men and women will serve us all as we
 
plan responsibly for the coming year, 
responsibly and also illumined 
by our vision
 
of kind and powerful values in a world that
 
is often unkind and distorts power. Rooted
 
in a living tradition proclaiming Love for
 
all, dignity for all, and access to all, these
 
stewards will help organize our commitments
 
of support in service
 
of our mission and values.
 
 
Mindful both of what you can do and of
 
your personal circumstances, 
 
mindful that we freely agree to work together
 
for the common good because our values 
 
ground and inform us;
 
mindful that both our hunger for justice
 
and passi
on for truth meet in us to call
 
us on our way, 
 
will you join us in blessing
 
these stewards as they do their work in the
 
coming weeks? 
 
 
Members or friends, will you bless them by 
responding to them with yourselves?
 

Will you bless them with clarity? 
 
Will 
you bless them with kindness?
 
Will you bless them hospitality? 
 
Will you bless them with honesty? 
 
Will you bless them for the sake of our common 
future which begins on this day? If so, please
 
praise this moment of yes with your applause.
 
And then let us s
ing 1028 in the Teal Books.
