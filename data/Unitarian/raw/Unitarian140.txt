The First Reading 
is from David Richo™s 
most excellent book ?How To Be An Adult.? 

 
Guilt is not a feeling, but a belief or judgment.  
Appropriate guilt is a judgment that is self-
confronting and leads to resolution.  Neurotic guil
t is a judgment that is self-defeating and leads 
to unproductive pain.  Appropriate guilt is resolve
d in reconciliation and restitution.  Neurotic 
guilt seeks to be resolved by punish-ment. In appro
priate guilt there is accountability.  In 
neurotic guilt there is blame.  In short, appropria
te guilt is an adult response; neurotic guilt is th
e 
response of a scared child within us. 

 
In every experience of neurotic guilt, there is som
ething we are refusing to acknowledge. This 
kind of guilt is a tactic we use 
to avoid
 feelings and truths: 
 
1.  Guilt as a Disguise for Fear 
Guilt that holds us back from acting can be a disgu
ise for the fear of assertiveness. Guilt that 
follows a strong choice can be a fear of loss of lo
ve or of approval.  We may fear the 
consequences of not being liked or of losing contro
l when we have strayed too far from an 
inhibition. 

 
2.  Guilt as a Downplay of Responsibility 

Neurotic guilt limits us to one single course of le
gitimate behavior.  In this respect, guilt inhibits
 
imagination, the creative basis of choice.  As long
 as we are caught in guilt, we do not see 
possibilities or know what we really want.  This is
 how guilt subverts assertiveness. 
 
3. Guilt as a Mask for Anger  

Guilt can mean justifiable anger toward a respected
 parent, authority figure, or friend who seems 
to have obligated or inhibited us.  We believe it i
s unsafe or wrong to feel or to express this 
anger.  This leaves us to be wrong and so the unexp
ressed anger turns inward as guilt.  
 4. Guilt as A Dodge of Truth 

Guilt is sometimes used to avoid an unacceptable tr
uth.  For example, during childhood, rather 
than face the painful truth that my parents did not
 love me, I believed myself to be guilty of not 
measuring up to their expectations.  Then their lac
k of love became all my fault.  ?They had the 
love stored up for me, but I could not merit its re
lease.? 
 
The Second Lesson
 is a poem by the American poet Marge Piercy, who ha
s, in recent years, 
contributed much to Jewish Liturgy. The word niggun
, used in this poem, is a kind of music 
from the Jewish traditions, a driving pulse of musi
c that immediately moves the heart and 
the hips. I have shortened the poem for this servic
e– 
 Coming Up On September 
 
 3 White butterflies, with single  

black-finger-paint eyes on their wings, 

dart and settle, eddy and mate 

over the green tangle of vines  

in Labor Day morning steam. 
 The year grinds into ripeness  

and rot, grapes darkening,  

pears yellowing, the first 

Virginia creeper twining crimson,  

the grasses, dry straw to burn. 

 
I begin to reconsider my life. 

What is the yield of my impatience? 

What is the fruit of my resolve? 
 I turn from my frantic white dance  

over the jungle of productivity,  

and slowly a 
niggun
 slides 
cold water down my throat. 

I rest on a leaf spotted red. 
 The New Year is a great door 

that stands across the evening  

and Yom Kippur is the second door.   

Between them are song and silence–  

  

I will find there both ripeness and rot,  

what I have done and undone,  

what I must let go with the waning days  

and what I must take in.  

With the last tomatoes,  

we harvest the fruit of our lives.

This is the time in our flow of morning celebration
 when some of our members and friends bring 
a portion of the pledges they have promised to the 
church, for the church is the congregation of 
the people who agree to make it. If you are a guest
 this morning, or just visiting, it™s ok to let the
 
basket pass you by in peace this 

morning. Should you one day choose to share in the 
work of this good community, we will 
welcome your generous gift with gratitude, 

for generosity of spirit is the power that sustains
 any community of justice, learning and love. 

 
Kol Nidrei
    
 
All vows we have made to live 
 the unexamined life are now cancelled 

 by the invitation of these words. 

 Gone are the promises we made  

because of pressure or praise. 

Gone are the promises we made 

because of shame. 

Gone are promises and vows we made 

because of habit, because of custom, or 

because of confusion. Gone they are, vanished! I se
e them no longer. They are no more. 
Gone the excuses for why I can™t live 

within my own truth, but must orbit some other trut
h. 
Gone the vows I made to confirm myself 

by jumping through someone else™s hoops. 

Gone my vow to never have dreams, 

so I wouldn™t offend anyone else.  

Gone, vanished, just like that! 

As magically as sunset, 

as wondrously as moonset, it disappears, 

this habit of refusing to live on the edge. 

 
Cut is the knot of all the choices  

I did not make, could not make,  

would not make, 

sundered by the sharp knife of this prayer,  

just like that, just like that. 

The paper is blank, the field is empty,  

the map has not been made.  

The pretend guarantees, like morning dew 

have evaporated. 

And thus now I no longer have to hide  

in the shelter of guilt, but I can show up, 

and be present to myself and to others. 

Now I will no longer define myself  

by my failings and the strains of my life. 

 8 Nishmat hayay tevarykh v™kherev libi yahshir: Kol o
d neshamah bekirbi.
 The breath of my life will bless; the cells of my B
eing sing in gratitude, awakening! 
 
Sung Portion 

 
For remaining silent because of fear or guilt, 

instead of speaking up because of care and  

mindfulness. 

We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 
For all the times when a sense of guilt or 

an unnamed fear kept us rigid, righteous, 

raw and resentful. 

We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 
For each time we have moved toward anger 

and defensiveness faster than we have welcomed the 
saving intrusion of the truth. 
We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 
For each time the seduction of our own consistent c
omfort has turned us away from 
acknowledging or responding to the need of our neig
hbors. 
We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 
For the times we have confused our feelings of lone
liness with other things, like  
self-worth or the need to blame others. 

We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 For trying to be perfect when no measure 

of perfection is even possible in this life 

We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 For trying to earn love, instead of welcoming it; f
or trying to control every minute of life 
rather than accepting it as a wondrous gift. 

We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love. 
 For these and for so many attitudes and acts, 
both obvious and not so obvious, which have fostere
d the illusion that we are truly 
separate from each other and completely self-derive
d. 
We forgive ourselves and each other, we begin again
 in love.
