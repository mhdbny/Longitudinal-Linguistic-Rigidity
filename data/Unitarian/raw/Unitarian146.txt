Sermon 

 
Breadlines. I heard a lot about breadlines from my 
grandparents. They were speaking of the Great 
Depression era of the last century, when the nation
™s whole economy suffered terribly. Many people 
who were getting along well enough suddenly found t
hemselves poor. So poor, they needed food they 
could no longer buy for themselves.  

 
 3 My grandparents grew food in their garden, and kept
 chickens back when that was still legal in the 
city. Still, despite their thriftiness and sense of
 independence, they remember those days as lean and
 
hungry. They were glad when they were over. 

 
And so, with this history of hunger in my family, i
t cannot be surprising that, by the time I was 
growing up decades later, food was more than food, 
bread more than bread. Every meal was a likeness 
of love, a species of nurture. Every table was lavi
sh with the pride of having made it through the 
terrible days; they were victory feasts. In very re
al ways, every meal I ate with my grandparents in t
he 
fifties, sixties and seventies were Thanksgiving su
ppers, especially for folks, like my grandparents, 
who barely survived the bread-poor days of the 1930
s. 
 
The poet May Williams Ward talks about riding a tra
in in that same era. She sits across from a gaunt 
young man who is eating a sandwich he had brought w
ith him, instead of buying some food on the 
train. Or maybe had stolen some bread–the line ?he 
did not buy his lunch? can be taken in different 
ways, I suppose. In any case, she sensed he was poo
r, relishing his bread perhaps even more than those
 
who had plenty.  

 
I guess she™s saying something akin to the old prov
erb ?absence makes the heart grow fonder.?  And 
certainly, I don™t have to be convinced that a hung
ry person might indeed appreciate food more than a 
person who has access to three meals every day. 

 
But I sense that she also tends to romanticize the 
poor young man™s poverty. She symbolically breaks 
bread with him, she says, even though they are each
 hiding behind their newspapers, him with his 
crumbly piece of bread, her with her bought lunch. 
It™s a lovely image, sure. But then she closes her 
poem by writing these words: 
The long fasts we must take because of poverty, mak
e crumbs more 
sweet. 
  
As I said, I™m sure if you are destitute you might 
tend to be thankful for every crumb you get. But I 
would like to offer that it would be far better to 
question the inevitability of poverty than to find 
some 
compensating solace in crumbs. I am not sure it mak
es sense to say that the fasts, or better, the hung
ers 
which accompany poverty, are fated, pre-destined, o
r fall into the ?I guess this just had to be!? pit 
that 
so many seem to dig before my eyes these days. An e
arthquake or a hurricane may be inevitable, but 
poverty? 

 
A couple of years ago, you™ll remember the horrific
 tsunami that washed away almost 300,000 lives 
near the shores of the Indian Ocean. The fishing fa
milies who survived the disaster had been eking out
 
a living for centuries, and, like my grandparents, 
were self-sufficient enough to feel a sense of prid
e. 
Oh, they were poor by every standard we use in the 
States, and yet they worked hard, shared their 
catch and survived well enough. 

 
But, as soon as their villages were wiped away, lar
ge resort corporations found loopholes in local law
s 
in order to claim the shore for themselves, to buil
d fabulous seaside villas for those who can afford 
such things. They actually had wanted to do this be
fore the tsunami; the tsunami just made it easier f
or 
them. And fishing people? They were told to ?go fis
h,? except, of course–they couldn™t. As natives of 
the land, the law didn™t permit them to go back hom
e ?for safety reasons.? But the law had no problem 
with foreign investors–largely from the USA, buildi
ng vast resort compounds that effectively 
prevented the former families from moving back and 
building their homes again once they were so 
permitted. Some of them were even kept in ?camps? f
urther inland; ?camps? a word tainted by 20
th
 century history.   

 
 4 New Orleans had a disaster too. Not an earthquake-c
aused tsunami, but a hurricane, Katrina. But 
before that disaster, there were many voices alread
y talking about ?cleaning up? the vast areas of 
public housing. The poor, you see, are more than po
or. They are an embarrassment. There were also 
voices complaining that there was no prayer in publ
ic schools, and that religion was being kept out of
 
the very schools which provided relatively free edu
cation to everyone, including the poor.  The levees
, 
as you know, were repaired with a truly remarkable 
slowness after Katrina. But, almost in the 
twinkling of eye, of the 123 public schools run by 
the School Board before Katrina, only four were lef
t 
after Katrina. Most of the rest had become for-prof
it Charter Schools or private schools–where prayer 
could be said, but to which no poor parent could af
ford to send their children. 
 
Also, our own national government did, in New Orlea
ns, exactly what it had been doing in Iraq. 
The work of rebuilding the infrastructure was given
 to large corporations and their contractors. 
Journalist Naomi Klein, in her well-documented new 
book 
The Shock Doctrine
, writes, ?
Within weeks 
(of Katrina) the Gulf Coast became a domestic labor
atory for the same kind of government-run-by-
contractors that had been pioneered in Iraq. The co
mpanies that snatched up the biggest contracts 
were–familiar: Halliburton, Blackwater, Parsons, Fl
uor, Shaw, Bechtel–all top contractors in Iraq. 
Their contracts ended up totaling 3.4 billion; no o
pen bidding required.
  
Which means, folks, we™re not talking about the rom
anticized ?capitalism? of family shopkeepers and 
eager entrepreneurs. Without bidding for contracts,
 there is no competition, and competition is one of
 
the central pillars of capitalist economic theory. 
There is nothing entrepreneurial about what happene
d 
in New Orleans. It was pure cronyism on behalf of t
hose who have, so that those who have nothing can 
stay that way. They can live in trailers, eat at Fa
ith Missions, get accused of being drug-crazed lazy
 
bums, and perhaps, like the young man in the poem, 
filch a bit of bread to eat on the sly. A long time
 
ago, the great Hebrew teacher Jesus summed up crony
ism this way: 
?Those who have plenty, get more. 
Those who have nothing have even that nothing taken
 away from them.? 
(Mark 4:25)?  And 
that 
bitter 
observation reminds me that this business of organi
zed power brokers, or vast corporations who 
answer to no one, or large contractors who don™t pa
y their workers even minimum wage---or anything 
at all (which was true of 60% of the hired laborers
 in New Orleans, for example), has been around for 
a 
long time.  In Jesus™ day it was the Roman occupati
on with its collaborators, like Herod Antipas, whic
h 
pushed the population into poverty, making bread mo
re of a luxury for many, not a daily staple. 
Apparently, the Romans assumed it was their right t
o take what was not theirs, since they did it with 
so 
little conscience. They felt they had a right to co
nfiscate the lands of small farmers so they could c
reate 
agribusiness instead. They felt it was their right 
to make overweening profits. And why not, right? 
Since being wealthy beyond reason has always been 
everyone™s
 goal hasn™t it? ?Stop complaining, and 
keep on dreaming that you™ll win the lottery one da
y!  You can be as rich as we are. You just hold on 
a 
while.? 

 
The story from the Gospel of Mark offers us an   al
ternative to ?participation? in that ?dominant 
economic order,? to use Ched Meyers™ words. 

 
?Instead,? Meyers writes, ?the Galilean teacher det
ermines the available resources, organizes the 
consumers into groups, pronounces the blessing, and
 distributes what is at hand.  We should be clear 
that there is nothing ‚super-natural™ reported to h
ave transpired in the feeding of some five thousand
; 
only that ‚they all ate and were satisfied.™  The o
nly ‚miracle™ here is the triumph of the economics 
of 
sharing within a community of consumption over agai
nst the economics of autonomous consumption 
in the anonymous marketplace.? 

 
In other words, the story is about sharing, or coop
eration, not competition and one group of powerful 
people systematically trouncing others with economi
c clout. There was bread enough, apparently, but 

 5 no one wanted to share. The disciples are portrayed
 as being indignant because they think that Jesus 
has asked them to spend their own hard-earned money
. Their resentment reveals to me that they are 
entirely caught in the dominant system, which teach
es not social justice, social change, or the 
deliberate cultivation of a social conscience, but 
rather the right to be peeved that anyone is asking
 
anything of anybody. Aren™t we all autonomous, resp
onsible only for ourselves? But instead, Mark™s 
Jesus speaks of organizing together. Inviting peopl
e into groups. Where they can look into each other™
s 
eyes and see for themselves that they are brothers 
and sisters, not statistics. They are brothers and 
sisters, not the means to an absurd profit. They ar
e brothers and sisters, human beings who have the 
power, yes, the power, to share earth™s abundant br
ead with other human beings.  Each of whom is 
infinitely precious for who they are, not what they
 amass, as our children™s story affirmed this 
morning. Our worth is innate, not purchased at the 
price of the human heart, or wagered away on 
things. 

 
When everyone  ?was satisfied,? the story goes, the
re were 12 baskets of scraps and crumbs left over. 
The number 12 is not accidental, of course. It refe
rs to the so-called 12 apostles, whom Mark™s Gospel
 
is always slamming for their foolishness and cluele
ssness.  In this case, the story is critical of the
 way 
certain self-anointed church leaders, symbolized by
 the twelve, had taken the story of Jesus, 
which was 
always about social justice in the first place
.  But the church leaders made it over into a mirac
le-
mongering wallow in shallow, smug piety: i.e. ?I™m 
saved, you™re not.? Nothing nourishing there, the 
story insists. Just a few worthless crumbs left ove
r, from what was once hearty loaves of bread. 
 
It seems to me this story is saying, ?Why would any
one have a vision of being insanely wealthier than 
everyone else? Why would anyone think that the good
 life is something you purchase or manipulate 
into being at the cost of other lives? No, the good
 life is when we share, not when we grab in panic. 
Why would folks have a vision of winning the lotter
y for themselves, when they could just as easily 
train themselves to see a vision of a world where f
olks share bread, not hoard it? Why would anyone 
have a vision of making a salary in the millions, l
ike the CEO of Halliburton, and instead have a visi
on 
of shared abundance for everyone? Why would anyone 
offer crumbs, when they could have offered 
bread instead? The story says quite clearly: the br
ead always comes before the crumbs. 
 
Breadlines. Broken-down trailers. Razed public hous
ing. Laws which favor the powerful and keep the 
poor at bay. Using weather disasters to make a prof
it on the backs of the poor, while denying them 
access to a free public education...these are stale
, nasty crumbs. 
 
And, really, unlike our romantic poet, I don™t thin
k the crumbs taste all the better because hunger 
appreciates anything rather than nothing.  I say, l
et™s eat real bread, and not satisfy ourselves with
 the 
crumbs. Loaves are ultimately better, because they 
are a dignified and appropriate nourishment for 
both body and soul. Whereas crumbs are, quite liter
ally, for the birds. 
 
I say, bread is for breaking and sharing. But let n
ot the have-nots be broken by the haves. Ever. 
What™s that proverb I hear all the time? ?The defin
ition of insanity is doing the same thing over and 
over again, but expecting different results.?  I sa
y the old vision is insane. It has failed time and 
time 
again, as the Galilean pointed out.  Time for a new
, healthier vision. Time to awake to that vision.  
Now.   

 
Offering 

 
We do ask for your generosity of spirit as regards 
social issues in the world.  And you always come 
through.  And we see the results, incremental as th
ey may be.  But it™s also true that we need to keep
 
the heat on, clean the floors, pay salaries, and ke
ep the building which houses our dream of social 

 6 justice for all in good repair. So, some of our mem
bers and friends bring a portion of the pledges the
y 
have promised to the church, for the church is the 
congregation of the people who agree to make it. 
Some mail their gifts in, but others prefer to offe
r their gifts in the context of worship, the time o
f the 
week where we consider our values, our ideals, our 
visions in our lives. If you are a guest this morni
ng, 
or just visiting, it™s ok to let the basket pass yo
u by in peace this morning. Should you one day choo
se 
to share in the work of this good community, we wil
l welcome your generous gift with gratitude, 
for generosity of spirit is the power that sustains
 any community of justice, learning and love.
