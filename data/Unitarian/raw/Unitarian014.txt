  m.l. king day, nyc, 1989
  
  we are here
  at one of the campsites
  of the dream
  
  still far from
  the mountaintop
  still
  
  we the women
  we the children
  we the men
  
  black, brown, red
  yellow, white
  we've heard the speeches
  
  and prayers
  we've been in the wars
  we carry our dead
  
  at times as casually
  as air 
  the hopeful
  
  and the wounded
  sit closest
  to the fire
  
  soon it will
  be morning
  again
  
  soon it will be
  time to march
  again

  I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth century
  prophets left their little villages with their "thus saith the Lord," I too
  am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular home town.
  
  Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities. I cannot
  sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham.
  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an
  inescapable network of mutuality.
  
  You deplore the demonstrations that are presently taking place. I am sorry
  that your statement did not express a similar concern for the conditions
  that brought the demonstration into being. Your reluctance suggests to me
  that the contemporary church is often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain
  sound. It is so often the supporter of the status quo. The power structure
  of the average community is consoled by the church's silent and often vocal
  sanction of things as they are.

(sung) Gonna lay down my easiness,
  Gonna lay down my codes and cant,
  Gonna lay down my guilt and shame,
  Gonna lay down my hurt and hype,
  Gonna lay down my hide and seek,
  Gonna lay down my tag, you're it,
  Gonna say we're together now,
  down by the river side, down by the riverside,

(spoken) down by the riverside,
  gonna let that great river,
  wash it all to the sea
  so I have all the room 
  and time I need to study 
  how to better love.
