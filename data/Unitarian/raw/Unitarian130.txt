 1 2007-03-18 Miracles &Visions  

 
We are here 

to join together deliberately 

to shape a community of witness and care 

that can offer a healing vision to the world, 

and provide a place where wonder and honesty 

also make us more whole. And so we say 

 
As we move through this year of transition and joy,
 we remember with 
gratitude the power of our living heritage, which m
oves through time 
like a clear running creek; refreshing us with the 
sweet draughts of 
courage, hope, justice-making, peaceful living, eve
r deeper honesty, 
and more truthful loving. And so we kindle this lig
ht in thanksgiving. 
 
Sequence 

I wonder. 

Do the buds feel as impatient as I do when winter l
ingers on? 
I wonder. 

Does the crocus have growing pains 

like I had when I was young? 

I wonder. 

Is the first sight of the unfolding yellow snapdrag
on in Columbus Ohio any 
less exciting than the arrival of the first autumn 
gold on the trees in 
Melbourne, Australia? 

I wonder. 

Can my delight in warming spring have something to 
do with my hope for 
a real thaw of icy injustice here on the earth? 

I wonder. 

When a bud opens into a blossom does something in m
e begin to blossom 
too? 

I wonder. 

Are the dreams of snuggling winter really so differ
ent from the dreams of 
skipping spring?  

I wonder. 

Can questions like these really fly 

without the wings offered by silence?  

 2 Silence 

 
I wonder. Is there anything more miraculous, 

more wonderful, than love? 

I wonder. Who are the loving men and women and chil
dren who never let 
me go, 

those whose love has delivered me onto the 

threshold of this hour? 

How can I begin to thank them for what they have do
ne without first 
naming them explicitly? 

I begin with these names–silently or spoken. 

 
Naming 

 
I wonder. 

If the world spun around the sun, and the sun 

traveled through the galaxy of stars for almost 

five billion years before the invention of music–ho
wever did it make it 
through? 

 
Reading 

 
The First Reading 
comes from an anthology of writings by Unitarian 
Universalists called 

Stand By This Faith. This particular piece comes fr
om my brilliant 
colleague Naomi King. 

 
It is work
. 
It is work for our teens and children and for our e
lders and for 
ourselves because living faithful lives requires co
urage and stamina. It 
requires courage because we are bucking conventiona
l wisdom by just 
being here. The more we give ourselves to hope and 
act on that, the more 
we are working against the conventional wisdom. 

 
Conventional wisdom says: 

Only a few people are worth caring about, so get ev
erything for yourself 
that you can. 

If you are not wealthy, it™s your fault. 

 3 If you are not happy, it™s your fault. 

And you better hope to get into heaven one day. 

 
You are 
here
 though. 
Here
, where we say: 
 
Everyone is worth caring about, even if we have to 
struggle to see that. 
We can have enough money and time and give to other
s too. 
There is such a thing is social inequity, and we™re
 working to change that. 
Happiness requires a great many things, and it begi
ns here in human 
connection and caring. 

And whether there is a heaven or not, we need to ge
t to work here and 
now. 

 
What we do here extends beyond these doors. 

We™re doing church even when we™re not at church. W
e™re doing church 
the other six days of the week. We are constantly m
aking the choice 
to stand with this faith and make hope real. When w
e open this circle, we 
are standing with this faith. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The Second Reading 
comes from one of the votive tablets found at 
Epidauros in Greece, 

a healing center famous for its dream therapy. 

These tablets were commissioned around the year 400
, but contain 
recorded stories from 

hundreds of years earlier, such as the following: 

 
Once there was fellow who could only move one finge
r in his hand. So he 
came to Epidauros as a seeker. When he saw all of t
he votive tablets in the 
sanctuary, he did not believe any of the stories th
ey told about miraculous 
healing, and he ridiculed them. But still, he did w
hat all the others did: fell 
asleep in the sanctuary and had a vision. In his vi
sion, he was playing dice 
in the cellar of the temple, and just as he was abo
ut to throw, the god 

 4 Asklepios appeared to him, and jumped on his hand, 
and stretched out his 
fingers. When the god stepped off his hand, the fel
low was able to wiggle 
all of his fingers easily. The god asked him if he 
still had no confidence in 
the healing stories on the tablets. The fellow said
 ?No, I don™t.? ?Well 
then,? said the god, ?from now on your name will be
 Mr. Skeptic!?  (Gk: 
Apistos) But  when the man woke up in the morning, 
he emerged from the 
temple, completely healed. 

 
Sermon 

 
For me there is no question that human beings 

are– vulnerable. They demonstrate remarkable fragil
ity, and can be 
broken pretty bad. I™m not talking about slipping o
n the ice and breaking a 
bone, although that™s certainly part of it. I™m tal
king about broken spirits, 
too, and broken-heartedness. I am talking about fol
ks whose 
path through life is eroded by broken promises, 

or, whose ordinary road toward healing and health a
nd wholeness ends up 
in bureaucratic quicksand because of a broken healt
h care system. Or a 
broken safety net. Or even a  

broken down will, a deeply fractured hope. 

 
And because this is true, since time immemorial, pe
ople all around the 
world have sought healing from the brokenness. They
 have sought health. 
Wholeness. 

 
Sometimes they go to physicians. Sometimes to 

therapists. Sometimes to the shoulders of reliable 
friends. Sometimes to 
religious or spiritual or various political circles
.  
 
Of course, there can be brokenness within these cir
cles, within these 
systems too. For example, ver and over again, the t
ent and television 
preachers have been shown to be hucksters and charl
atans. Skeptics like 
the Amazing Randi, (who, as a professional magician
, 
knows
 slight of 
hand when he sees it) were able to show that evange
lists like Peter Popoff 
were using secret two-way radios to effect ?superna
tural? knowledge. Yet 
only a few years after being exposed as a fraud, Po
poff is on TV again, and 

 5 in hotel ballrooms, claiming to work miracles by th
e hundred, and making 
broken people whole. But hardly anyone knows the Am
azing Randi. 
 
Of course, it™s easy to fall into the trap that jus
t because there are hucksters 
and creeps dispensing false healings that there are
 no healings anywhere 
outside the standard medical establishments. This i
s simply not true. 
Healing goes on all the time. In hospitals and outs
ide of them.  Sometimes 
involving medical skills. Sometimes not. There are 
now and have always 
been spontaneous healings that no one understands. 
Medical libraries are 
filled with documentations of such events. The reli
gious tend to suggest 
God or a spirit has something to do with these heal
ings, but I assure you, 
they have happened to atheists too. My grandfather,
 a pretty devout atheist, 
was told by the doctors after they had operated on 
him that it was unlikely 
he would live till morning. The evidence was all ag
ainst him. But he went 
on to live another 30 years, which surprised the do
ctor, who had said the 
next morning ?It™s a miracle that this man is still
 alive.? 
 
And even like places at Lourdes, or the Brazilian h
ealing center Joao de 
Deus based on native spiritist religion, healings d
o occur. Brokenness is 
repaired. Not supported by theologies that I share.
 But nonetheless, 
wonderful things sometimes happen at the borderline
 between brokenness 
and health, and I cannot deny this is true just bec
ause my theology is 
different. No theology is the same as universal rea
lity in my book. 
 
The common word for unexpected healings is 
miracle.
 Like when the 
doctor said of my grandfather ?It™s a miracle he™s 
still alive.?  What he was 
saying was that it was 
a wonder
 that he was alive. What he was saying was 
that something was swaying my grandfather™s life in
 another direction. 
What he was saying is that his surprising survival 
through the night was a 
harbinger of future possibilities and a more abunda
nt life.  And that, of 
course, is all the word 
miracle
 means. Wonder. Harbinger. Sway. Even in 
the Western Scriptures, as I have pointed out many 
times, there are no 
words that mean 
miracle
 in the modern, and rather foolish theological 
sense of the word, meaning, a supernatural interven
tion from a Spirit 
outside the universe.  The Greek and Hebrew words t
hat are sometimes 
foolishly translated as ?miracle? are as follows: o
th, a harbinger, mopheth, 

 6 a wonder, pala, wondrous thing, dunamis, or powerfu
l sway, or semion, a 
harbinger/sign. 

 
I don™t know about you, but it seems to me if that 
is what the word miracle 
means, then miracles are not rare, but they abound.
 Every spring bud, for 
one. Every challenge to inequity. Every truth told 
in place of a lie. Every 
act of forgiveness, small or great. Every question 
to self or others that 
deepens us. Every sunset we actually notice. Every 
moment of every 
friendship. Every time people are generous, or hosp
itable, or gracious or 
kind. Miracles all. Powerful sways. Wonders. Harbin
gers of a world both 
healthy and whole. 

 
Many of the healing stories in the New Testament su
pport the idea that 
miracles are not magic tricks, but social commentar
ies. They are always 
placed into a social context, which makes the heali
ng more of a protest 
against the prevailing system than just an unexpect
ed sway toward health 
for a lucky individual. One woman, a story says, ha
d spent her entire 
income for years on the health care system, and had
 only gotten worse, not 
better. So in the story, her healing doesn™t cost a
 red cent, and that™s a 
decided critique against a system that had put her 
in the poor house. 
Another person had a bad back for 18 years, and whe
n she was healed and 
stood up straight, people complained that it was th
e wrong time for her to 
be healed, because her gladness overshadowed the jo
y of the holiday they 
were celebrating. Again, you have here a point of s
ocial critique rather 
than a medical expose. 

 
And the New Testament is only one place where you c
an find healing 
stories, or miracle stories, if you will. Every hum
an culture I know of, past 
and present, offers theories and practices and site
s for healing, both 
medical and extra-medical. And each of these places
 claims moderate 
success at offering wondrous healings of some forms
 of human 
brokenness. The Greeks and Romans built many healin
g centers called 
Asklepions
, where the broken and sick came to spend the night
 and dream 
sacred visions which often healed them. The god Ask
lepios, and goddess 
Hygiea (from whose name we get our modern English w
ord ?hygene,?) 
were the patrons of the temple centers. The walls o
f these sanctuaries were 
lined with crutches and canes and eye-patches, depo
sited by the newly 

 7 healthy. There were also testimonies cut in stone, 
telling the healing stories 
to future generations. In the reading this morning 
from the walls of the 
Asklepion in Epidauros, the largest and most famous
 healing site of the 
ancient world, the story of Mr. Skeptic is told. He
re is someone who has 
no real faith in the miraculous. He doubts the real
ity of all these healing 
stories. Yet he enters the shrine and sleeps on the
 floor as all the others do. 
At night, he dreams of Asklepios, who actually rena
mes him Mr. Skeptic 
as well as straightening out his fingers. 

 
It™s a delightful story. And the man, though a comp
lete skeptic in matters 
miraculous, is  

healed by a having a dream. 

 
This technique of using dreams to heal, to make who
le, is hardly some 
outmoded technique that hasn™t been used since the 
Parthenon fell into 
ruin. The seminary I attended was famous for its dr
eam courses. This 
church is filled with dream circles, where people, 
by sharing their dreams, 
come to a sense of deeper wholeness and understandi
ng. I have used 
dreams when I have worked with a therapist to unrav
el some conundrum 
in my life. Dreams can be healing. 

 
But the word ?dream? or the word ?vision? does not 
have to refer to either 
a night dream or even to the sorts of ecstatic visi
ons which people reported 
at Lourdes or Epidauros. The word 
vision
 and its synonym 
dream 
also 
have a social meaning. Like those healing miracles 
in the New Testament I 
told you about. For instance, Martin Luther King Jr
. was hardly talking 
about sleep when he claimed ?I have a dream.?  And 
when Naomi King in 
her wonderful reading tells us that to be in a Unit
arian Universalist con-
gregation is 
to work against
 ?conventional wisdom,? she is talking about 
having a vision. Right here, right now. Not of a go
d or a saint. But it™s a 
vision of a world where brokenness can be healed, w
here spirits are not 
broken, where broken-heartedness is not a permanent
 condition. A dream 
of a world where ?Everyone is worth caring about, e
ven if we have to 
struggle to see that.? The dream is also one of a w
orld where ?We can 
have enough money and time, and give to others,? on
e where we 
acknowledge openly and with humility that ?There 
is
 such a thing is social 
inequity, and we™re working to change that.?  The v
ision of this wondrous 

 8 community is a healing dream, not really different,
 really, from the dreams 
at Epidauros, except that here we are not just inte
rested in finding healing 
for our own selves, but in helping to heal a wounde
d world, and in finding 
ways to celebrate and lift up life on the other sid
e of wounding. And this, 
even though many of us are even 
more 
skeptical than Mr. Skeptic. 
 
To support and be part of a community that holds su
ch a wonderful vision, 
a community that stands against conventional wisdom
 with  
a radical freedom and inclusive embrace, seems some
thing like a miracle 
to me. A miracle achieved not by gods and goddesses
, but ordinary human 
beings who have decided enough is enough and who wa
nt to make dreams 
that transcend brokenheartedness a reality.  

 
But it™s 
work
, says Naomi King. It requires stamina. That makes 
it sound 
like there is no pleasure in it, no joy in supporti
ng an institution that tries 
to live out a vision of a just world. 

It makes it sound like to do something wonderful, t
o do something 
miraculous you have to really put out a lot of wear
ying extra effort. Why 
would anyone want to do that? We have so many other
 things in our lives, 
so many other commitments, so many other loves. 

 
Well, I understand. But I also want you to know tha
t, I know something 
about miracles personally. I am now going to tell y
ou about a miracle that 
involved generous financial contributions and a lot
 of work and 
organization. But to make this comparison more fun,
 I have to tell you it 
had nothing to do with church. That way, you might 
be able to see the 
miracle for what it is. 

 
My friends Anne and Rosemary bought a house in Oakl
and, CA 23 years 
ago. Ann™s elderly father was going to live in the 
house with them. The 
house was, let™s be kind here, a fixer-upper. It ne
eded work. But, because 
of her father, she needed to move in right away. So
 thinking of an Amish 
barn-raising, Anne called thirty or so of her frien
ds and colleagues and 
asked them, with the promise of pizza and beer, if 
they would come over 
on a certain Saturday and paint and fix the entire 
house. In one day. 
 
 9 It was intense, but you know what? We all showed up
. Those of us who 
knew how to paint and fix things showed those that 
didn™t how to do it, 
and in 12 hours, the entire house was painted insid
e and out, windows and 
doors fixed,  

floors polished. It was amazing. It gleamed. 

 
Some weeks later, Anne called me up and said ?Hey B
elletini, I know you 
know how to cook for multitudes, and like doing so,
 so I am asking you to 
come and cook a wonderful Italian supper to thank a
ll the folks who 
helped me paint and fix the house.? 

 
?I™d love to, ? I said. ?Sounds like fun.? 

 
So we chose a day for the party and she invited eve
ryone. We went 
shopping all morning. And by 2, I was in the kitche
n, chopping, blending, 
sautéing. She had said about 40 people were coming.
 That seemed more 
than the number who had painted the house, but I th
ought, well, maybe 
people are bringing partners or friends. 

 
Soon I had three pastas going in three different po
ts and was in a frenzy. 
People were showing up along the sidewalk outside t
he kitchen, and I 
wasn™t sure I™d finish in time. Anne suddenly burst
 into the kitchen and 
said ?You 
have
 to come out for the door prize drawing.?  I said ?
No I 
don™t. I have three pots boiling here and I can™t l
eave. Besides, I am 
helping you with the party so it™s not fair if my n
ame is drawn.?   
 
?Just  for  a  minute!? she said with authority I k
new I couldn™t resist. 
?And anyway, you helped me paint, so I put your nam
e into the hat.? 
 
So I walk outside, wave to the gathered folks witho
ut much of a smile on 
my face. I am impatient to get back in the kitchen.
 And they draw names 
from the hat. ?3
rd
 prize: A bottle of 
chianti
 for Lindi Ramsden. Second 
prize: A coupon for three free pizzas for Art Ungar
. And first prize: A 
month long free trip to Italy with hotels, Eurail p
ass, and spending money 
for–. Mark Belletini.? 

 
Now, I want you to know, I did not believe this. 

 10
 I mean, who would?  

 
Then I looked out at the silent faces staring at me
 intently, waiting for my 
response, and realized that I had been wondrously h
oodwinked into 
cooking my own surprise party. I saw faces there th
at did not belong to 
people who had painted so I knew how wide they had 
cast their net. When 
I realized what they had done, I locked myself into
 the kitchen, pushed a 
credenza in front of the door to block it, and crie
d for a good long time. 
 
Turns out, Anne, Rosemary and two other colleagues,
 Janne and Robbie, 
were sitting around one day and talking about trips
 to Europe, when one of 
them asked ?Belletini has never gone before, has he
??  ?How could he?? 
Anne asked. ?He serves at a very small church, 

and I sometimes wonder if rent itself is a concern 
of his.?  (It was.) So one 
of them said ?Let organize a ‚Send Belletini to Ita
ly™ circle.? 
And immediately, they thought this zany, generous a
nd joyous idea was 
simply wonderful. They worked hard, but with a skip
 in their step, 
to make that wonderful idea take flesh. 

 
And that summer, I walked the streets of my ancestr
al Bologna for the first 
time, and climbed the Etruscan ruins in Fiesole. An
d I wept each and every 
day as much as I laughed, for I assure you, it™s am
azing to be on the 
receiving end of  

miracle. No mere words can convey how much! 

 
Now you need to know, this was not about me. 

Because, you see, there were folks at that party I 
didn™t know very well. Or 
at all. But when they heard that they could contrib
ute money to do 
something wonderful, something that appeared to be 
nothing less than a 
miracle, they all wanted in on it. People were beat
ing down their doors to 
contribute to something so unexpected, so unimagina
ble, so wonderful. 
And 23 years later, the people who were part of tha
t event are still joyous 
to have been part of it. I still get calls about it
. The sister of my heart, Rev. 
Barbara Pescan was there–she preached on this very 
story last week up in 
Evanston. She is still, so many years later, comple
tely electrified and 
transformed by the whole idea of giving and organiz
ing to work a miracle. 
 
 11
 But remember, this story is not about me. It™s simp
ly a model for what this 
canvass is about. It™s not to send some poor bloke 
to Rome, but it™s about 
joyously giving together so that there is more heal
ing in this world, not 
less. And its about the same point made by the chil
dren™s story this 
morning, namely, that its good to work together to 
create something 
wonderful. It™s about more dreams acted out instead
 of deferred with cries 
of hopelessness and mere practicality. It™s about m
ore visions for 
organizing around anti-oppression work, not so some
one gets to walk the 
Appian Way, but so that someone in the society we s
erve might not be 
kept away from the welcome table. The miracles of h
ealing we propose are 
not instantaneous, nor are they supernatural. But t
he world is filled with 
brokenness, folks, both social and personal. And if
 we are not about 
addressing that, joyously miraculously, wondrously,
 then what are we 
about? If we are not a harbinger of a better world,
 and only a reflection of 
what Naomi King calls conventional wisdom, then why
 bother? And if it 
can be such a transforming joy to be part of such a
 wonder, such a miracle, 
as my story about my surprise-party made amply clea
r to me, then what™s 
keeping us back? 

 
Let™s cook our own surprise party and invite the wo
rld and surprise them 
too.  

 
The vision is clear. The dream is beautiful.  

The need is evident. The joy is tangible. And what 
can better than that? 
 
Circle Prayer
  
The circle of our history: 

Prophets and seekers, teachers and pilgrims, misfit
s and mentors: we are as 
much a part of it 

as Emerson and Susan B. Anthony, 

as Channing and Olympia Brown, 

as Thandeka and Rabindrananth Tagore. 

The circle of our world: 

The poor and the privileged, the struggling and the
 wondering, the whole 
and the broken: 

we are just as much a part of it  

 12
 as Lincoln and Eleanor Roosevelt, Jesus and Joan of
 Arc, Martin Luther 
King Jr. and Black Elk. Oh Love, greater Circle aro
und our 
smaller circles, circle whose center is 

everywhere and circumference nowhere, 

here we are,  a community that struggles and loves 
and falls and rejoices 
and dances and feasts and learns and copes and thri
ves and joys. 
Deepen our community so that as we turn 

face to face, we keep on turning until we 

face the world outside, where the real flaming chal
ice of justice, 
compassion and love 

is even now being kindled. Amen.
