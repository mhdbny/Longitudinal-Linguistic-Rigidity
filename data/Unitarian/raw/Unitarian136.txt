Opening Words
  
We are here 

at the end of the month of May 

to worship, to praise new things 

while remaining rooted in heritage. 

We begin our time of word, silence and song 

with these words 

 
As we move through this year of transition and joy,
 we remember 
with gratitude the power of our living heritage, wh
ich moves 
through time like a clear running creek; refreshing
 us with the 
sweet draughts of courage, hope, justice-making, pe
aceful living, 
ever deeper honesty, and more truthful loving. And 
so we have 
kindled this light in thanksgiving. 

 
Story:
  
Jacob and Esau and the Dream 
 
Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, 

there were two brothers.   

One was named Jacob and one was name Esau. 

They were twins, babies born at the same time. 

But they were not the kind of twins who looked like
 each other.  
They were very different from each other. 

They were VERY, VERY different from each other. 

They liked to do very different things. 

They spoke with different words. 

They liked different people. 

Esau liked to spend time with his father. 

Jacob liked to spend time with his mother. 

 
The loved each other, but they sometimes fought. 

Sometimes they fought a lot. 

 
 2 Sometimes they played tricks on each other, and mad
e each other 
really mad. 

 
As they grew older, Esau stopped playing so many tr
icks on Jacob. 
But Jacob never stopped, and kept it up. 

 
One day, when they were teenagers, Jacob really did
 something 
terrible to Esau. He told a terrible lie to him, an
d tricked him, and 
stole something that was very, very important to hi
m. 
 
Esau was really angry. REALLY, REALLY angry. 

He shouted. He waved his hands.  

 
?Jacob, you have to grow up. You cannot keep on tri
cking me and 
lying to me. But you don™t ever seem to want to gro
w up. Right now, I 
am so mad I don™t like you at all. I am going away,
 and I don™t want to 
spend time with you anymore. Goodbye.? 

 
So Esau told his parents that since he was old enou
gh, he was going to 
go out camping for a while. 

 
They didn™t know what happened, but they could see 
Esau was upset. 
They thought maybe if he spent some time by himself
 he would feel 
better. 

 
Well, Esau had been SO angry, that Jacob became fri
ghtened, and he 
left too. He told his parents that he wanted to go 
camping too. So left 
his home and wandered around all day until he had g
one far into the 
desert. He tried to tell himself that Esau was just
 being mean, but as he 
walked and walked he kept feeling something funny i
n the pit of his 
stomach. 

 
He wondered. Was Esau right? Did he need to grow up
? 
 
Finally, he was so tired he needed to sleep. So he 
took a blanket out of 
his backpack, and used a sort of long round rock co
vered with his 

 3 jacket as a pillow to support his neck on the rough
 ground. And he fell 
asleep.  

 
While he slept, he dreamed. And he dreamed of a ste
ep staircase, 
almost as steep as a ladder, going all the way up t
o the beautiful, 
beautiful stars. There must have been a thousand st
eps he thought. 
And on the steps he could see people climbing up an
d down the stairs, 
very carefully, one step at a time. 

 
Then he woke up. The stars were there, but there wa
s no staircase. But 
then he wondered if the staircase was inside him in
stead of outside of 
him. He wondered if he should be climbing the stair
s carefully one at 
a time. He wondered if he could climb so high he co
uld see things 
clearer and better. 

 
When he got back home, Esau was still upset. And th
ings were not 
OK with them for a long time. Jacob grew up and Esa
u grew up and 
both of them happened to get married. And during al
l this time, Jacob 
kept on climbing the inner stair case. One step–he 
stopped tricking 
people. Another step. He looked at his own anger. A
nother step. He 
wondered why he wanted to make his brother mad. Ano
ther step. He 
realized his brother had been right. Finally, after
 many years, Jacob 
went to find his brother. He came to a river, and t
here was his brother 
on the other side. He called to him. Esau answered 
back. And he 
smiled. He too had been climbing the staircase insi
de of him, and 
asking questions. He too wondered about his anger a
nd his tricks. 
They both waded into the river and met in the middl
e of it, and they 
hugged each other. ?I™m sorry,? said Jacob. ?I was 
mean to you.?  ?I 
am over it,? said Esau. ?I love you, my brother. It
s time to make up 
for all the time we lost.? 

 
And they did, brothers who were friends until the e
nd of their days. 
They were still different. They still liked differe
nt people, did different 
things. But they both grew up, following the rule o
f love, the rule of 
honesty, the rule of kindness, instead of the rule 
of  
anger, lying and fighting. 

 
 4 Sequence 

 
I think of the young men and women 

who live in harm™s way, who hear gunshots 

and wonder if their next heartbeat is their last. 

I think of the teachers who ache for vacation, 

the students who have stopped learning now. 

I think of the folks distorted by their addictions,
 fighting uphill battles, wandering the streets, or 
the mazes of their 
lives. 

 
I think of those I know and those I do not know 

who are facing health problems–dizziness, 

or ringing, or aches in joints they didn™t know  

they had. I think of their bewilderment and fear. 

 
I think of those who are out of work, or who 

hate their jobs, or who wish they hadn™t retired. 

 
I think of those who love their work, or work too m
uch, or who have 
too many irons in the fire. 

 
I think of those who paint, or sing, or dance, or w
rite poetry, and I 
think of those who are blocked in their art and jus
t can™t move 
forward. 

 
I think of those who are highly structured, and I t
hink of those who are 
spontaneous, and feel constrained by structure. 

I think of those who take time to think, and those 
who respond with 
feelings first and want to burst. 

 
I think of those who know betrayal and disappointme
nt, and I think of 
those who know love and surprise and unexpected joy
. 
 
I think of the music to come–but I think about welc
oming the silence 
first. 

 
 5 silence 

 
I think of all those who have shepherded me to this
 very moment of 
grace and joy: those who loved me even when I was h
ard to love, 
those I have loved even when they were hard to love
, even those 
strangers who have been there for me in far away pl
aces, and those 
who now live in my heart. I think of them, I think 
of their names and 
say them aloud or within. 

 
naming 

 
I think of the training, the practice, the skill an
d the passion behind the 
music. I think of the composer, the influences, the
 rhythm of the heart 
behind it all. I think of how lucky I am to live! 

 
Readings 

 
The First Reading is a poem by the great Pacific No
rthwest poet, 
David Whyte, who wrote this poem back in the 1990™s
. Poet Whyte 
works with business and corporations, helping leade
rs there find the 
poetry in their own work. The title is 
Seven Steps for Coming Home. 
And there is a subtitle too–a phrase from the Germa
n poet Rilke:
 Oh, 
pure contradiction! 

 
One step to take notice 

the next one to look and to praise 

the third to be praised 

the fourth is, strangely, for love 

the fifth is to be, 

caught between water and sky. 

 
The sixth is return 

the seventh unspeakable 

except in one small stolen poem 

flawed by the heart, spoken to one other 

in secret never to be said again. 

 
 6 After this look down at the paper 

And see who is writing. 

Your hands only your hands 

 
A pure contradiction, 

a pure blessing. 

Everything you learned  

has come to nothing. 

 
The Second Reading
 is a list of New Rules I received from the 
nationally well know interventionist, Julie Kelly. 
David Whyte had 
seven steps for returning to a healthier self. Juli
e offers us nine new 
rules to help us along the way. 

 1.
 Mistakes are essential to learning. 
2.
 You get to practice. 
3.
 You can be accountable. 
4.
 Nobody can do it right all the time. 
5.
 You are not defective. 
6.
 You can develop skills, not defences. 
7.
 People will be there for you. 
8.
 You are not accountable to unspoken rules. 
9.
 Personhood is the most important thing you have. 
 
Sermon 

 
Several times now in my preaching history here 

I have mentioned the intervention I was privileged 
to join at my 
former congregation. 

 
It was the new sort of intervention, not for the al
coholic alone, but for 
the whole family and community surrounding him or h
er. 
 
As minister of the couple whose son was in deep tro
uble, I spent four 
days with the whole family 

from grandma to wife to step-brother to parents and
 step-parent. I 
learned, in the high language of the Dao Dejing, ?t
en thousand 

 7 things,? things I had never even imagined before ab
out the human 
heart, the human mind, the tricks and graces of the
 soul, the urgings 
and resistances of the body. Especially in regard t
o addictive 
substances or addictive behaviors. 

 
Most people have at least heard of the 
12 steps
 approach to addictions, 
you know, the Alcoholics Anonymous approach, and Na
rcotics 
Anonymous approach. The 
12 steps
 are both praised and critiqued, 
(like everything else in the world that I can think
 of,) but there are 
certainly many millions, including folks within thi
s congregation, who 
are glad to say how much 

these steps helped them in their healing, their ste
p by step climb 
toward health. And this, even if they do keep a few
 theological 
critiques in their pocket.  

 
The idea that healing, recovery, spiritual maturity
, or the path of 
wholeness, is not some sudden miracle but a gradual
 process is hardly 
new, nor did it originate with AA back in the early
 twentieth century. 
The word ?gradual? itself is only an English form o
f the Latin 
?graduus? which means 
step
. And I think you™ll agree, the idea of 
wholeness being a step-by-step program is the basis
 of all language 
and mathematical education. You cannot read Goethe 
until you 
practice at the language lab for years. You cannot 
solve for ?x? until 
you know what 2x2 is. Physical therapy takes it one
 step at a time, 
too. You start slowly at first, and build up to the
 harder stretches. 
Olympic gymnasts don™t go from relaxing in a chair 
to the ?iron 
cross? without many practice steps along the way. A
nd no one plays 
the piano or tuba or piccolo without learning the t
echnique one step at 
a time. 

 
In the world of spirituality, both religious and se
cular, you will find 
check-lists or steps to help you on your way. Ignat
ius Loyola, founder 
of the Jesuits, created a set of Spiritual Exercise
s that is used to this 
very day. The Jewish medieval 
Kabbalah
 speaks of steps of learning, 
just as the Buddhists speak of the eight-fold path,
 or some Hindu™s 
speak of meditating on the various charkas, or symb
olic centers rising 
from the base of the spine to the top of the skull.
  

 8  
In my high school years, as I went through the vari
ous yoga postures, 
I often reflected on this symbolic ladder in my bac
k. My Fellowship 
Committee colleague, the wonderful P.D. Wadler, a U
nitarian 
Universalist psychologist from Chicago, understands
 the very 
Principles and Purposes of our own religious organi
zation to be a set 
of spiritual exercises–.since they begin at the fir
st principle by asking 
us to meditate on our inherent worth as individuals
, and they end with 
the seventh principle, which asks us to recognize t
hat we are 
interconnected with all living things, and are part
 of, not sovereigns 
of, a larger spiritual context called the universe.
  
 
And this idea of spiritual steps, of checklists, if
 you will, inviting our 
maturity, is not just related to religions or organ
izations. Individual 
poets seem to have grasped this idea too. The amazi
ng poet, novelist 
and heretic Nikos Kazantzakis, (who earned a solemn
 
excommunication from his Greek Orthodox church for 
daring to write 
the ?
Last Temptation of Christ,?)
  also wrote a book called the 
Spiritual Exercises,
 which deeply influenced me in my teens.  And the 
lovely poem by David Whyte which you heard this mor
ning suggests 
a personal vision, listing seven steps we might tak
e to enable us to 
?come home? to our more mature self.  

 
His steps are as follows: 

1. to take notice, or as Thich Naht Hahn says, 

    ?Be mindful,? as we move through the world. 

2. to look and to praise; this is a call to 

    revere instead of walk by unconsciously, 

    a compact form of the famous line in the 

    novel ?The Color Purple? which suggests 

    that not to appreciate the color purple when 

    you see it 

3. to dare to accept praise yourself, you know, 
by simply saying ?thank you? and without denying it
 by saying ?aw 
shuck, its nothing.? 

It IS something. 
4. strange as it seems, he maintains, its always  

 9     possible to develop more skills in loving; 

5. 
to be
 he says, living ?between water and  
    sky? instead of running around like 

    the proverbial chicken 
doing
 things  
    all the time. 

6. to actually return, which means going back 
to look over your life, remembering you cannot appr
oach the 
future if you ignore the nature of the paths by whi
ch you are 
getting there; 
7. to accept the mystery at the heart of the 

    journey, accepting that steps and lists and 

    words themselves are all insufficient when 

    compared to the mystery of relating to each 

    other directly and emotionally, face to face. 

 
Then he adds, interestingly, look at your hands! lo
ok at yourself as a 
real physical entity, not a symbol or subject of th
eology, but as 
something solid, flesh and blood, a person, not a m
etaphor. The poet 
concludes with the most marvelous and daring line: 
  
Everything you learned  

has come to nothing. 

 
In other words, you are probably going to have to 
unlearn
 unhealthy 
habits and reactions at the same time you learn bet
ter, more healthy 
ways to approach the world and your life. you have 
to both climb and 
descend the steps.  

 
And this very idea is embedded in the Western Scrip
tures in the 
famous story of Jacob and the staircase to the sky.
 The spiritual we 
sang this morning talks about Jacob™s Ladder, which
 is the King 
James™ mistranslation of the Hebrew ?sullah? which 
means a stepped 
ramp, or steep staircase, like the ones that you co
uld find on a 
Babylonian  step-pyramid called a 
ziggurat.
 In the Biblical story, 
Jacob dreams of this giant staircase going not to t
he top of a pyramid, 
butr all the way up to the sky, beyond the clouds a
nd into the stars, 

 10
 with what he called in the biblical text  ?God™s me
ssengers? climbing 
up and down each step carefully, way up high in the
 clouds. 
 
This dream to me is clearly a symbolic picture whic
h invites spiritual 
growth and maturity from the young and rather obnox
ious Jacob. You 
don™t grow up suddenly, the vision says, you grow a
nd mature step by 
step. You take it one step at a time, not two. You 
have to go down as 
well as up. You cannot rush this. I mean, what™s th
e need? Life is 
hardly a contest or anything. 

 
In the story, Jacob goes through many adventures an
d misadventures, 
ascending and descending his dream staircase all th
e while. 
Until, many decades later, he is reconciled to his 
brother Esau.  The 
actual biblical text is quite surprising, actually.
 Jacob has so come to 
revere his mature brother Esau that he calls him 

a ?god,? the only time I can think of in the Hebrew
 scriptures when a 
mere human being is appreciated with such a divine 
evaluation. 
 
And in so many ways, this is wise. For when a perso
n refuses to 
spiritually grow, whether by some step process I™ve
 listed, or by some 
other way, if structured exercises and steps are no
t to your liking, 
there is a tendency to slip into treating others as
 symbols, not unique 
human beings, or as means to an end, not an end in 
and of themselves. 
The goal of spiritual growth, it seems to me, wheth
er or not theism is 
your metaphysic, is to at least learn to revere the
 preciousness, the 
inherent worth, the divinity, if you will, glowing 
within each person. 
 
Which is why I like the meditative steps offered by
 Julie Kelly so 
much.  Julie was the interventionist in the family 
intervention I 
described at the beginning of this sermon. She is o
ne of the wisest and 
most powerful persons I have ever met, and she know
s her business, 
believe you me. I spent four days with this family,
 and the outcome, 
by the way, was terrific, the young man detoxing, a
nd then going on to 
work in the same sort of work himself after a while
. He has been clean 
and sober 10 years now. 

 
 11
 Part of the process was to educate the family about
 other factors 
involved in addiction besides biological factors. P
erfectionism, lack of 
self-esteem and other signs of wounding to the soul
 often accompany those struggling with such problems
.  They often 
also accompany the friends, family and society arou
nd them. It is 
because of these wounds to the soul, or heart, or m
ind, or psyche or 
self–choose your vocabulary– that I speak of 
healing
 at all, the 
move from fragmentedness and woundedness to wholene
ss.  
 
Even if addiction is not a problem for you, you may
 recognize some of 
these wounds as your own. The world is hardly divid
ed between the 
perfectly whole and the utterly broken. As Buddha r
eminded us, 
brokenness, pain and loss are simply the cost of be
ing alive, not 
punishments for evil behavior. His eightfold path w
as his suggestion 
for steps that might be taken to address this truth
. Julie Kelly, although 
certainly supportive of the traditional 12 steps --
-and all of their non-
theist, feminist and other permutations---was convi
nced that other 
issues needed to be faced step-by-step too. 

 
And so she offered us this set of New Rules you hea
rd earlier, rules to 
help define our daily practices, and to each serve 
as a focus for our 
meditations and daily thoughts. I find them most he
lpful, and use them 
often to re-center myself. 

 
Oh, sure, I know the old adage ?rules are meant to 
be broken.? And I 
realize that in a Unitarian Universalist church in 
particular, the very 
concept of ?rule? makes some people wince. 

 
They would rather try and draw their straight lines
 and curves without 
those little plastic rulers to guide them. They wou
ld rather that people 
spoke of disciplines or suggestions, rather than ru
les.  
 
Well, I™m a Unitarian Universalist too, and frankly
, I like the idea of 
rules. Because I have not been a minister for 30 ye
ars without noticing 
that almost everyone I have ever met moves to a set
 of 
unspoken
 rules 
whether they admit it or not. Rules like: ?It™s  

 
 12
 important to notice me; so, notice me.?  Rules like
: ?I should be first.? 
Rules like: ?Play fair, which means ‚do not exclude
 me.™?  Rules like 
?My mother treated me that way. You had better not,
 even though you 
never met my mother.?  Rules like ?Things should ne
ver change.?  
Rules like ?Don™t upset the apple cart.?  Rules lik
e ?If something 
bad–or good– happens to me, I must have 
deserved
 it.? 
 
Julie™s rules seem a lot healthier than these rules
. They were written to 
override and supplant many of these other rules, un
conscious as they 
are, so that life can be lived more consciously, an
d on healthier 
ground. 

 
Like her rule #1: ?Mistakes are essential to learni
ng.?  Seems obvious, 
but if there is anything of the perfectionist in yo
u–and there is plenty 
of perfectionist attitudes in me–the 
unwritten
 rule that needs to be 
replaced is this: ?Mistakes are a sign that you hav
e failed, and are not 
up to doing this.? 

 
So to offer a rule which says ?Mistakes are 
essential
 to learning? is to 
say something down right revolutionary.   

 
Or, to say ?You get to practice,?  rule #2. Note th
e phrasing: ?You 
GET to practice.?  In other words, the language lab
 is not a torture 
chamber, the piano scales are not the rack–.but bot
h are  privileges. 
Honors. And look, lets leave the verbs and musical 
instruments 
aside–and imagine practicing love-making techniques
, practicing 
sewing, practicing cooking, practicing dating–these
 and a thousand 
more are all privileges. And please remember rule n
umber one as you 
practice rule number two ?Mistakes are essential to
 learning.? 
 
But, she says in rule or step #3, you can be held a
ccountable. In other 
words, life-practice is serious. It™s not just a ga
me, with everyone 
falling down laughing their heads off at the end of
 the game. Life is 
serious, and people can be hurt by our mistakes, ev
en though making 
them is essential to our learning. To grow up spiri
tually is to face that 
and know that this is part of life, unpleasant as i
t may seem. 
 
 13
 But in rule #4, a most important step, she reminds 
us that NO ONE 
can get it right all the time. The important word i
n that sentence is No 
One. That is, we are all, every one of us, on entir
ely equal footing in 
this regard. Not only is perfectionism a waste of o
ur time, but we can™t 
be perfect even if we work at it for the rest of ou
r lives. It™s just not 
possible. This is the rule that lets the steam out 
of the pressure cooker 
once and for all. 

 
But, she says, even though we can™t be perfect, tha
t does not mean we 
are, therefore, defective, that we are losers, born
 into sin, miserable 
wretches. 

 
Which means, next step, that we don™t have to defen
d ourselves, since 
we are not worthless. 

 
It™s more important to hone our relationship skills
, to study them, 
practice them, to learn how to be direct, kind, non
-judgmental, patient, 
honest, balanced, and to work on not feeling threat
ened and wound up 
even in the presence of people we personally find u
npleasant. Skills, 
the rule says, not defenses. A simple rule, but a t
ough one for many of 
us, I™d wager. 

 
Then there is the matter of faith. Trust. Not the r
eligious 
understanding of faith. But the necessary faith tha
t people will be 
there for you is the seventh rule. Not because of s
upernatural 
compulsion, but because they are human, and most fo
lks know we are 
all in this together. Oh, sure, you can work hard o
n developing your 
cynicism muscles if you want, and label everyone in
 the world as 
completely untrustworthy, but then I would have to 
ask you ?whatever 
for?? Is this some defense? Do you think you will w
in some prize for 
isolating yourself behind a studied and committed f
aithlessness? I 
testify clearly that even when I was convinced that
 I had disappointed 
everyone, I still found folks showed up in my life.
 I can be as hard on 
myself as anyone in this room, I assure you, and ca
n come up with 
plenty of reasons why folks should stay away, but t
hey still come. 
 
 14
 But even though there are many trustworthy people i
n the world, there 
remain many folks too who have not developed a grea
t deal of 
mindfulness, or consciousness about their inner liv
es. They make 
rules, for you, for me, based on things that happen
ed in their past days 
and act as if that should be perfectly obvious. Thi
s rule---#8–you are 
not accountable to unspoken rules--- affirms that i
t isn™t at all 
perfectly obvious. So if someone seems hard bent on
 wounding you 
for not following their unspoken, utterly un-commun
icated and often 
utterly irrational rules, you are 
not
 accountable. There is no reason 
why you and I have to go through hoops we don™t eve
n know are 
there.  Again, this is a wise step to take in our l
ives–to discern the 
real from the false, and to always relate realistic
ally even to the false. 
 
Lastly, Julie™s 9
th
 rule states that Personhood is the most important 
thing you have.  Personhood. Your uniqueness. Your 
own story. 
Which is not anyone else™s story. Which is not what
 you own nor what 
you lack, but who you are, and who you are becoming
, as you grow 
deeper. 

 
Whether we are fighting addiction or not, whether w
e use the word 
spiritual or not, whether we are part of a traditio
n or a questioner of all 
traditions, I™d still say that the maturing of our 
soul, our character, our 
self–again, choose your word– is not some luxury, b
ut our calling, 
not something extra, but something basic. 

 
Climb Jacob™s ladder. Or spiral Sarah™s circle. 

Or use other language you like. But let us grow tog
ether, and move 
toward, if not finally achieve, wholeness. 

 
Memorial Prayer of the Heart 
 
O Heart of my heart, 

Life of my life, 

Singer of the song that is this moment! 

My heart moves through the world. 

My heart moves through the years. 

My heart bends. 

 15
 It bends before those who gave their lives 

while fighting. Their lives were infinitely preciou
s. 
It bends before those who lived and died 

amidst the fighting, civilians in an unfortunate pl
ace in an 
unfortunate time. 

Their lives were precious, infinitely so. 

It bends before those who wail, who sing 

laments, who chant the 
requiem
, the 
kaddish, 
the psalm of David or fourfold 
takbir,
 who 
lift their fist, who scream, who suffer hurt. 

Their lives are infinitely precious. 

And my heart bends, bends to the ground 

before those who struggle to make peace 

from sunrise to sunset, who create covenants of pea
ce and leave 
angry strife behind, though 

it costs them plenty to do so. 

How precious their every breath,  

their every heartbeat.  

Alleluia. 

Justice, come. Harmony, come. Strength, 

come. Love, come, & be signed by this our song. 

 
Song: Perfect Singer
