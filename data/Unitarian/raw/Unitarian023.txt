  Empathy is not merely the basic principle of artistic creation. It is also
  the only path by which one can reach the truth about life and society.

  The death of the Roman Emperor Tiberius in the year 36 legally ended the
  appointment of Pilate as Prefect of Judea. The Legate of Syria, Vitellius,
  deposed him, and sent him to Rome on charges of murder brought up by the
  families of all those whom he had slaughtered over his ten year tour of duty.
  
  Many strange legends would later accrue around Pilate's dismissal back to
  Rome.
  
  One of them is found in the 6th century legend which says that Tiberius recalled
  Pilate because he could not believe he had been so crass as to execute a
  man who might have been useful. You see, Tiberias had been ill with a fever
  and purple skin lesions. And news had reached Rome that Jesus cured people.
  Tiberius had already made a request for the holy veil on which a woman called
  Veronica had taken an impression of the face of Jesus while he was on his
  way to his death. When the veil arrived, the Emperor merely looked at the
  relic, and his skin was made soft as a child's. How could Pilate have executed
  such a man, the Emperor wondered, a human being whose very image imprinted
  on a square of cloth could be so powerful?

  "Today, each of us will take home a different flower than the one which we
  brought with us.  We do not ask who brought the flower we shall take
  with us, for by doing this we confess we are brothers and sisters without
  regard to class, race or any other differences between us.
  
  We belong to one spiritual community of liberty we who come together for
  the common good.
  
  Each of us needs to receive in order to grow up, but each of us needs to
  give something away for the same reason."
