III. THE BALLOT OR THE BULLET

Ten days after Malcolm X's declaration of inde­ pendence, the Muslim Mosque, Inc. , held the first ola series of four Sunday night public rallies in Harlem, at which Malcolm began the job of formulating the ideology and philosophy of a new movement. In the opinion of many who heard these talks, they were the best he ever gave. Unfortunately" taped recordings of these meetings were not available in the preparation of this book. Simultaneously, however. Malcolm began to accept speaking engagements outside of New York-at Chester, Pennsylvania; Boston; Cleveland; Detroit; etc. - and tapes of some of these were available.

In the Cleveland talk, given at Cory Methodist Church on April 3, 1 964, Malcolm presented many of the themes he had been developing in the Harlem rallies. The meeting, sponsored by the Cleveland chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, took the form of a symposium entitled "The Negro Revolt- What Comes Next?" The first speaker was Louis E. Lomax, whose talk was in line with CORE doctrine and was well received by the large, predominantly Negro audience. Malcolm's talk got even more applause, although it differed in fundamental respects from anything ever said at a CORE meeting.

"The Ballot or the Bullet, " Malcolm's own title for his speech, was notable, among other things, for its statement that elements of black nationalism were present and grow­ ing in such organizations as the NAACP and CORE. For various reasons, the black nationalist convention, which in this talk he projected for August, 1 964, was not held.

Mr. Moderator, Brother Lomax, brothers and sisters,

friends and enemies: I just can't believe everyone in here is a   friend and   I   don't want to leave anybody out. The question tonight, as I understand it, is "The Negro Revolt, and Where Do We Go From Here?" or "What Next?" In my little humble way of understanding it, it points toward either the b allot or the bullet.

Before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify something concerning myself.   I'm   still a   Muslim,   my   religion is still Islam. That's my personal belief. Just as Adam Clayton Powell is a Christian minister who heads the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, but at the same time takes part in the p olitical struggles to try and bring about rights to the b l ack people in this country; and Dr. M artin Luther King is   a Christian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country; and Rev. G alamison, I guess you've heard of him, is another Christian minister in New York who has been deeply involved in the school b oycotts to eliminate segregated education; well, I myself am   a minister, not a Christian minister, but a Muslim minister; and I believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary.

Although I ' m still a Muslim, I'm not here tonight to discuss my religion. I ' m not here to try and change your religion. I ' m not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about, because it's time for us to submerge our differences   and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem, a common problem - a p roblem that will make you catch hell whether you're a B aptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a nationalist. Whether you ' re educated or illiterate, whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am. We're all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man. He just h appens to be a white m an. All of us have suffered here, in this country, political oppression at the hands of the white m an, econdrnic exploitation at the hands of the white m a n, and social degradation at the hands of the white m an.

Now in speaking like this, it doesn't mean that we're a nti-white, but it d oes mean we' re anti-exploitation, we're

The Banot or the Bullet                              25

anti-degradation, we're anti-oppression. A n d i f the white m an   doesn ' t   want   us   to be   anti-him,   let him   stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us. Whether we are Christians or Muslims or nationlists or agnostics or atheists, we must first learn to forget our differences. If we have differences, let us differ in the doset; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue about until we get fmished arguing with the m an. If the late President K ennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we certainly h ave m ore in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev had with each other. If we don't d.o something real soon, I think you'll have to agree that we're going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet. It' s one or the other in 1 964. It isn't that time is running out - time has run out! 1 964 threatens to be the m ost explosive year America has ever witnessed. The most explosive year. Why? It's also a p olitical year. It's the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community j iving you and me for some votes. The year when all of the white p olitical crooks will be right b ack in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don ' t intend to keep. As they nourish these dis­ s atisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion; and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America today - I'm sorry,   Brother Lomax - who just doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer. Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you. If they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million Chinese. If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here. These odds aren't as great as those odds. And if you fight here, you will at least know what you're fighting for.

I'm   not a politician, not even a student of politics; in fact, I ' m not a student of m uch of anything. I'm not a Democrat, I ' m not a Republican, and I don't even con­ sider myself an American. If you and I were Americans, there'd be no problem. Those Hunkies that just got off the boat, they're already Americans; Polacks are already Americans;   the Italian refugees are already Americans. Everything that came   out of   Europe.   every b lue-eyed

thing, is already an American. And as long as you and I have been over here, we aren't Americans yet.

Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself. I'm   not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate. Being here in America doesn't m ake you   an American.   Being born here in America doesn't m ake you an American. Why, if birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation, you wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution, you wouldn't be faced with civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D . C . , right now. They don't have t o pass civil-rights legislation to   m ake   a   Polack an American.

No, I ' m not an American. I ' m one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democ­ racy,   nothing   but   disguised   hypocrisy.   So,   I'm   not standing   here speaking   to you   as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver - no; not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American dream; I see an American nightm are. These 22 million victims are waking up. Their eyes are coming open. They're beginning to see what they used to only look at. They' re becoming politically m ature. They are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast. As they see these new political trends, it's possible for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount. They had to recount in Mass achusetts to see who was going to be g overnor, it was so close. It was the s ame way in Rhode Island,   in   Minnesota,   and   in many other p arts of the country. And the same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president. It was so close they had to count all over   again.   Well,   what does this mean? It means that when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's oing to be in the dog house.

It   was   the   black m an's   vote that put the   present

The Ballot or the Bullet                               27

administration in W ashington, D. C . Your vote, your dumb v ote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an ad­ ministration in Washington, D. C . , that has seen fit to pass every kind   of legislation imaginable, saving you until l ast, then filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and t alk about how much progress we' re m aking. And what a good p resident we have. If he wasn't good in Texas, he sure can't be good in W ashington, D. C . Because Texas is a lynch state. It is in the same breath as Missis­ sippi. no different; only they lynch you in Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Missis­ sippi accent. And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker - that's all he is - and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the Southerners. What kind   of logic is that? Let Eastland be president, he's from the South too. He should be better able to deal with them than Johnson.

In this present administration they have in the House of Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans. They control two-thirds of the House vote. Why can't they p ass something that will help you and me? In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic Party. Only 33 of them are Republicans. Why, the Democrats have got the government sewed up, and you' re the one who sewed it up for them. And what have they given you for it? Four years in office, and just now getting around to some civil-rights legislation. Just now, after everything else is gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all summer long - the s ame old giant con game that they call filibuster. All those are in cahoots together.   Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots together, for the m an that is heading the civil-rights fili­ buster is   a man from Georgia named Richard Russell. When Johnson became president, the first man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D. C . , was "Dicky" ­ that's how tight they are. That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy. But they're playing that old con game. One of them m akes believe he's for you, and he's got it

28                                     Malcolm X Speaks fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never has to keep his promise.

So it's time in 1964 to wake up. And when you see them coming up with th at kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open. And let them know you got something else that's wide open too. It's got to be the ballot or   the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If you're afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out of the   country,   you should get back in the cotton p atch, you should get b ack in the alley. They get all the Negro vote, and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return. All they did when they got to W ashington was give a few big Negroes big jobs. Those big Negroes didn't need big j obs, they already had j obs. That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing. I'm not trying to knock out the Democrats for the Republicans, we'll get to them in a minute. But it is true - you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last. Look at it the way it is. What alibis do they use, since they control C ongress a nd the Senate? What alibi do they use when you and I ask, "Well, when are you going to keep your promise?" They blame the Dixiecrats. What is a Dixiecrat? A Democrat. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Demo­ crat in disguise. The titular head -of the Democrats is also the head of the Dixiecrats, because the Dixiecrats are a part of the Dem ocratic Party. The Democrats have never kicked the   Dixiecrats   out   of the   party.   The Dixiecrats bolted themselves once, but the Democrats didn't put them out. I magine, these lowdown Southern segregationists put the Northern Democrats down.   But the Northern Democrats have never put the Dixiecrats down. No, look at that thing the way it is. They have got a con game going on, a po­ litical con game, and you and I are in the middle. It's time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is, and trying to understand it like it is; and then we can deal with it like it is.

The Dixiecrats in Washington, D. C . , control the key committees that run the government. The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority. The only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where Negroes can't vote. This is not even a government that's based on democracy. It is

The Ballot or the Bullet                               29

not a government that is m ade up of representatives of the people. H alf of the people in the South can't even vote. Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington. H alf of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key p ositions in W ashington, D . C . , are there illegally, are there unconstitutionally.

I was in Washington. D. C., a week ago Thursday, when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor. And in the b ack of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge m ap of the United States, and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country. And it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most heavily con­ centrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up fllibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the Negro from being able to   vote. This   is   pitiful. But   it's   not   pitiful   for   us any longer; it's actually pitiful for the white man, because soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise th at he' s in, sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he' s in, then the Negro's going to develop a new tactic.

These senators and cohgressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that p articula r state or county the right to vote. And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated. You don't even need new legislation. Any person in Congress right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated,   that particular person should be expelled from Congress. And when you expel him, you've removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful lgislation in this country. I n fact, when you expel them, you don ' t need new legislation, because they will be re­ placed by black representatives from counties and districts where the black m an itt in the majority, not   in   the m inority.

If the black man in these Southern states had his full voting rights,   the   key Dixiecrats in Washington, D.C., which means the key   Democrats in Washington, D.C., w ould lose their seats. The Democratic Party itself would

-----------------------------------------------------Page 18-----------------------------------------------------
﻿
30                                  Malcolm X Speaks

lose its power. It would cease to be powerful as a party. When you see the amount of power that would be lost by the Dem ocratic Party if it were to lose the Dixiecrat wing, or b ranch, or element, you can see where it's against the interests of the Democrats to give voting rights to Negroes in states where the Democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the Civil War. You just can't be-­ long to that party without analyzing it.

I   say   again,   I'm not anti-Democrat, I'm not anti­ Republican,   I'm not anti-anything. I ' m just questioning their sincerity, and some of the strategy that they've been using on our people by promising them promises that they don't intend to keep. When you keep the Democrats in power, you're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. I doubt that my   good Brother Lomax will deny that. A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a Dixiecrat. That's why, in 1964, it's time now for you and me to become more politically m ature and realize what the b allot is for; what we're sup posed to get when we cast a ballot; and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a situation where we're going to have to cast a bullet. It's either a b allot or a bullet.

In the North, they do it a different way. They have a system that's known as gerrymandering, whatever that means. It means when Negroes become too heavily con­ centrated in a certain area, and begin to gain too much political power, the white man comes along and changes the district lines. You may say, "Why do you keep saying white   man?" Because it's the white man who does it. I haven't ever seen any Negro changing any lines. They on't let him get near the line. It's the white man who does this. And usually, it's the white m an who grins at you the most, and pats you on the back, and is supposed to be your friend. He may be friendly, but he's not your friend. So, what I'm trying to impress upon you, in essence, is this: You and I in America are faced not with a seg­ regationist conspiracy,   we're   faced with a government conspiracy.   Everyone who's filibustering is a senator - that's the government. Everyone who's finagling in Wash­ lngton, D . C . , is a congressm an - that's the government. You don't have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government. The same gov-

The Ballot or the Bullet                              31

ernment that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your v oting rights, deprive you of your economic op­ portunities, deprive you of decent housing, deprive you of decent education. You don't need to go to the employer alone, it is the government itself, the government of Ameri­ ca, that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country. And you should drop it in their lap. This government has failed the Negro. This so-called democracy has failed the Negro. And all these white liberals have definitely failed the Negro. So, where do we go from here? First, we need some friends. We need some new allies. The entire civil-rights struggle needs a new interpretation, a broader interpreta­ tion. We need to look at this civil-rights thing from another angle - from the inside as well as from the outside. To those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism, the only way you can get involved i n the civil-rights struggle

'

is give it a new interpretation. That old interpretation ex­

cluded us. It kept us out. So, we're giving a new interpre­ tation to the civil-rights struggle, an interpretation that will enable us to come into it, take part in it. And these handkerchief-heads who have been dillydallying and pussy­ footing and compromising - we don't intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer. How can   you thank a m an for giving you what's already yours? How then can you thank him for giving you only part of what's already yours? You haven't even made progress, if what's being given to you, you should have had already. That's not progress. And I love my Brother Lomax, the way he pointed out we're right back where we were in 1954. We're not even as far up as we were in 1954. We're behind where we were in 1954. There's more segregation now than there was in 1954. There's more racial animosity, more racial hatred, more racial violence today in 1964, than there was in 1954. Where is the progress?

And now you're facing a situation where the young Negro's coming up. They don't want to hear that "turn­ the--other-cheek" stuff, no. In Jacksonville, those were teen­ agers, they were throwing Molotov cocktails. Negroes have

-----------------------------------------------------Page 19-----------------------------------------------------

32                                  Malcolm X Speaks never done that before. But it shows you there's a new deal coming in. There' s new thinking coming in. There's new   strategy   coming in. It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and something else next   month.   It'll be b allots,   or   it'll be bullets. It'll be liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death - it'll be reciprocal. You know what is meant by "reciprocal"? That's one of Brother Lomax's words, I stole it from   him. I   don't usually deal with those big words because I don't usually deal with big people. I deal with small people. I find you can get a whole lot of small people   and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people. They haven't got anything to lose, and they've got every­ thing to gain. And they'll let you know in a minute: " It takes two to tango; when I go, you go."

The   black   nationalists,   those   whose   philosophy is black nationalism, in b ringing about this new interpreta­ tion of the entire meaning of civil rights, look upon it as meaning, as B rother Lomax has pointed out, equality of opportunity. Well, we're justified in seeking civil rights, if it means equality of opportunity, because all we're doing there is trying to coUect for our investment. Our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood. Three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return - I   mean without a dime in return. You let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is, but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick. It got dch because you made it rich.

You take the people who are in this audience right now.   They're poor, we're all poor as individuals. Our weekly s alary individually amounts to hardly anything. But if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively it'll fill up a whole lot of baskets. It's a lot of wealth. If you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year, you'll be rich - richer than rich. When you look   at   it like that, think how rich Uncle Sam had to become, not with this handful, but millions of black people. Your   and   my mother and father, who didn't work an eight-hour shift, but worked from "can't see" in the morn­ ing until "can't see" at night, and worked for nothing, m aking the white man rich, m aking Uncle Sam rich. This is our investment. This is our contribution - our

The Ballot or the Bullet                               33 blood.   Not only did we give of our free labor, we gave of our blood. Every time he had a call to arms, we were the first o nes in uniform. We died on every b attlefield the white man had. We have made a greater sacrifice than anybody who's standing up in America today. We have made a greater contribution and have collected less. Civil rights, for those of us whose philosophy is black nation­ alism, means: "Give it to us now. Don't wait for next year. Give it to us yesterday, and that's not fast enough." I might stop right here to point out one thing. When­ ever you're going after something that belongs to you, anyone who' s depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal. Understand that. Whenever you are going after something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive   you of that which is yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Su­ preme   Court   decision.   It   outlawed segregation.   Which means segregation is against the law. Which means a seg­ regationist is breaking the law. A segregationist is a crim­ inal. You can't label him as anything other than that. And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your side. The Supreme Court is on your side.

Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law? The police department itself. With police dogs and clubs.   Whenever you   demonstrate   against   segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated housing, or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer. They are b reaking the law, they are not representatives of the law. Any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you, kill that dog, kill h Im, I'm telling you, kill that dog. I say it, if they put me in j ail tomorrow, kill - that - dog. Then you'll put a stop to it. Now, if these white people in here don't want to see that kind of action, get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in. That's all you have to do.   If   you   don't do   it,   someone else will.

If you don 't take this kind of stand, your little chil­ dren will grow up and look at you and think "shame." If you don't take an uncompromising stand - I don't mean

34                                 Malcolm   X Speaks go out and get violent; but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence. I ' m nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me. But when you drop that violence on me, then you've made me go   insane, and I'm not responsible for what I do. And that's the way every Negro should get. Any time you know   you're   within the law, within your legal rights, within your moral rights, in accord with justice, then die for what you believe in. But don't die alone. Let your dying be reciprocal. This is what is meant by equality. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. When we begin to get in this area, we need new friends, we need   new   allies. We need to expand the civil-rights struggle to a higher level- to the level of human rights. Whenever you are in a civil-rights struggle, whether you know it or not, you are confining yourself to the jurisdic­ tion of Uncle Sam. No one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle. Civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country. All of our African brothers and our Asian brothers and our L atin-American brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the   United   States. And as long as it's civil rights, this comes under the jurisdiction of U nele Sam.

But the   United Nations h as what's known as the charter of human rights, it has a committee that deals in human rights. You m ay wonder why all of the atroci­ ties that have been committed in Africa and in Hungary and in Asia and in Latin America are brought before the U N, and the Negro problem is never brought before the U N. This is part of the conspiracy. This old, tricky, blue­ eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend, supposed to be in our corner, supposed to be subsidizing our struggle, and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an   adviser, never tells you anything about human rights. They keep you wrapped up in civil rights. And you spend so much time barking up the civil-rights tree, you don't even know there's a human-rights tree on the same floor.

When you expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights, you can then take the case of the black m an in this country before the nations in the U N. You can

The Ballot OT the Bullet                               35

take it before the General Assembly. You can take Uncle Sam before a world court. But the only level you can do it on is the level of huma n rights. Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, u nder his jurisdiction. Civil rights keeps you in his pocket. Civil rights means you're asking Uncle Sam to treat you right. Human rights are some­ thing you were born with. Human rights are your God­ given   rights.    Human rights   are   the   rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth. And any time any one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court. Uncle Sam' s hands are dripping with blood, dripping with the blood of the black man in this country. He's the earth's number-one hypocrite. He has the au­ dacity - yes, he has- imagine him posing as the leader of the free world. The free world! - and you over here singing "We Shall Overcome." Expand the civil-rights strug­ gle to the level of human rights, take it into the United Nations,   where our African b rothers   can   throw their weight on our side, where our Asian brothers can throw their weight   on   our   side, where our   Latin-American brothers can throw their weight on our side! and where 800 million Chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side.

Let the world know how bloody his hands are. Let the world know the hypocrisy that's practiced over here. Let it be the b allot or the bullet. Let him know that it must be the b allot or the bullet.

When you take your case to Washington, D . C . , you're taking it to the criminal who's responsible; it' s like run­ ning from the wolf to the fox. They're all in cahoots to­ gether. They all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world. Here you are walking   around in America,   getting   ready to be d rafted and sent abroad, like a tin soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what are you fighting for, and   you have   to stick   your   tongue in your   cheek. No, take Uncle Sam to court, take him before the world. By ballot I only mean freedom. Don't you know - I disagree with Lomax on this issue - that the ballot is more important than the dollar? Can I prove it? Yes. Look in the UN. There are poor nations in the U N ; yet those poor

36                                 Malcolm X Speaks nations can get together with their voting power and keep the   rich nations from making a move. They have one nation - one vote, everyone has an equal vote. And when those b rothers from Asia, and Africa and the darker parts of this earth get together, their voting power is sufficient to hold Sam in check. Or Russia in check. Or some other section of the earth in check. So, the ballot is most im­ portant.

Right now, in this country, if you and I, 22 million African-Americans - that's what we are - Africans who are in America..   You're nothing but Africans. Nothing but Africans. In fact, you'd get farther calling yourself African instead of Negro. Africans don't catch hell. You're the only one   catching hell. They don't have to pass civil-rights bills for Africans. An African can go anywhere he wants right now. All you've got to do is tie your head up. That's r ight, go anywhere you want. Just stop being a Negro. Change your name to Hoogagagooba. That'll show you h ow silly the white man is. You're dealing with a silly m an. A friend of mine who's very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in Atlanta before they called themselves desegregated. He went into a white res­ taurant, he sat down, they served him, and he said, "What would happen if a Negro came in here?" And thel'e he's s itting,   black   as   niglat,   but because he had his   head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says, "Why, there wouldn't no nigger dare come in here." So,   you're   dealing with   a m an whose   bias   and prejudice are making him lose his mind, his intelligence, every   day. He's frightened.   He looks around and sees what's   taking place on this earth, and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction. The dark people   are   waking up.   They're losing their fear of the white man. No place where he's fighting right now is he winning. Everywhere he's fighting, he's fighting someone your and my complexion. And they're beating him. He can't win any more. He's won his last battle. He failed to win the Korean War. He couldn't win it. He had to sign a truce. That's a loss. Any time Uncle Sam, with all his m achinery for warfare, is held to a draw by some rice­ eaters,   he's   lost the b attle.   He   had   to   sign   a   truce. America' s not supposed to sign a truce. She's supposed

The   Ballot or the Bullet                               37 to be b a d . B ut she's not b a d any more. She's b ad a s fong as she can use her hydrogen bomb, but she can't use hers for fea r Russia might use hers. Russia can't use hers, for fear that Sam might use his. So, both of them are weapon­ less.   They can't use the w.e apon because each's weapon nullifies the other's. So the only place where action can take place is on the ground. And the white man can't win another war fighting on the ground. Those days are over The black m an knows it, the brown man knows it, the red man knows it, and the yellow man knows it. So they en­ gage him in guerrilla warfare. That's not his style. You've got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior, and he hasn't got any heart. I ' m telling you now.

I just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because, before you know it, before you know it-It takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because you're on your own. In conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to b ack you up, planes over your head and all that kind of stuff. But a guerrilla   is   on his   own. All you have is a rifle, some s neakers and a bowl of rice, and that's all you need - and a lot of heart. The Jap anese on some of those islands in the   Pacific, when the American soldiers landed, one Japanese s ometimes could hold the whole army off. He'd just w ait until the sun went down, and when the sun went down they were all equal. He would take his little blade and slip   from bush to   bush,   and from American to American.   The white soldiers couldn't   cope with that. Whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the Pacific, he has the shakes, he has a nervous condition, because they scared him to death.

The same thing happened to the F rench up in French Indochina. People who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the heavily-mechanized F rench army out of Indochina. You don't need it - modern w arfare today won't work. This is the day of the guerrilla. They did the same thing in Algeria. Algerians, who were nothing but Bedouins, took a rifle and sneaked off to the hills, and de Gaulle and all of his highfalutin' war ma­ chinery couldn't defeat those guerrillas. Nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare. It's

no    his s  eed. Just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in

.

ASia and 1 0 parts of Africa and in parts of Latin America, you' ve got to be mighty naive, or you've got to play the black m an cheap, if you don't think some day he's going to wake up and find that it's got to be the ballot or the bullet.

I wO,,:"ld like to say, in closing, a few things concerning the Mushm Mosque, Inc . , which we established recently

   n New York City. It's true we're Muslims and our religion

1S Islam, but we don't mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities ­ not any more. We keep our religion in our mosque, After our religious services are over, then as Muslims we become involved in political action, economic action and social and civic action. We become involved with anybody, any­ where, any time and in any manner that's designed to eliminate the evils, the political, economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community. The political philosophy of black nationalism means the blac k m an should control the politics and the pol­

. ,

IticIans 10 hIS own community; no more. The black man in   the black community has to be re-educated into the

science of    oli  ics so he will  now what politics is supposed

to bring hIm 10 return. Don t be throwing out any b allots, A  allot is like a bullet. You don't throw your b allots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket. The political phi­ losophy of black n ationalism is being taught in the Chris­ tian church.   It's being taught in the NAACP. It's being taught   in   CORE   meetings.   It's being taught in SNCC f Student   Nonviolent   Coordinating Committeel meetings. It's being t aught in Muslim meetings. It's being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together. It's being taught everywhere. Black people are fed up with the dillydallying, pussyfooting, compromising approach that we've been using toward getting our freedom. We want freedom   now, but we're not going to get it s aying "We

.

Shall Overcome." We've got to fight until we overcome. The economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and   simple.   It only means that we should control the economy   of our   community. Why should white people

The Ballot or the Bullet                              39

be running all the " stores in our community? Why should white people be running the ' banks of our community'! Why   should   the   economy of our community be in the hands of the white man? Why? If a black man can't move h is store into a whte community, you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community. The philosophy of black nationalism involves a re-education program in the black community in regards to economics. Our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a com munity where you don't live, the community where you live will get poorer and poorer, and the community where y'ou " spend your money will get richer and richer. Then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area. And where you and I are concerned, not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community, but the white man has got all our stores in the community

tied up; so tha  though we spend it in the community, at

sundown the "man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere. He's got us in a vise.

So   the   economic philosophy of black   nationalism means   in every church, in every civic organization, in every fraternal order, it's time now for our people to be­ come   conscious   of   the   importance   of controlling the economy of our community.   If we own the stores, if we operate   the   businesses,   if we try   and   establish some i ndustry in our own community, then we're developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind. Once you gain control of the economy of your own communitY, then you don't have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business . The   social   philosophy   of black   nationalism   only means that we have to get together and remove the evils, the vices, alcoholism, drug addiction, and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community. We our­ selves h ave to lift the level of our community, the standard of our community to a higher level, make our own society beautiful   so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and won't be running around here trying to kllock our way into a social circle where we're not wanted. So I say, in spreading a gospel such as black nation­ alism, it is not designed to make the black man re-evaluate

 a.t

the white man - you know him already-but to make the black   man   re-evaluate   himself. Don't change the white m an's mind-you can't change his mind, and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of America - America's conli£ience is bankrupt. She lost all conscience a   long   time   ago.   Uncle Sam has no conscience. They don't know what morals are. They don't try and eliminate an evil because it's evil, or because it's illegal, or because it's immoral; they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence. So you're w asting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like Uncle Sam. If he had a conscience, he'd straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him. So it is not nec­ essary   to change the   white   man's mind.   We   have to change our own mind. You can't change his mind about us. We've got to change our own minds about each other. We have to see each other with new eyes. We have to see each other as brothers and sisters. We have to come to­ gether    with    warmth   so   we   can   develop   unity and h armony that's necessary to get this problem solved our­ selves. How can we do this? How can we avoid jealousy? How can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community? I'll tell you how.

I have watched how Billy Graham comes into a city, spre ading what he calls the gospel of Christ, which is only white nationalism. That's what he is. Billy Graham is a white nationalist; I'm a black nationalist. But since it's the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like Graham with suspicion and envy, how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders? Don't think because they're church leaders that they don't have weak­ nesses    that    make    them    envious    and    jealous -no, everybody's got it. It's not an accident that when they want to c hoose a cardinal [ as Popel over there in Rome,

fighting and carrying on.

Billy Graham comes in preaching the gospel of Christ, he evangelizes the gospel, he stirs everybody up, but he never tries to start a church. If he came in trying to start a church, all the churches would be against him. So, he

The Ballot or the Bullet                                 41

just comes in talking about Christ and tells everybody who gets Christ to go to any church where Christ is; and in this way the church cooperates with him. So we're going to take a p age from his book.

Our gospel is black nationalism. We're not trying to threaten   the   existence of   any organization,   but   we're spreading   the gospel of   black nationalism. Anywhere there's a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel   of black   nationalism,   join   that church.   If the NAACP is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join the NAACP. If CORE is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join CORE. Join   any   organIzation that has a gospel that's for the uplift of the black man. And when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising, pull out of it because that's not black nationalism. We'll find another one. And in this manner, the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality, and by August, it is then our intention to have a black nationalist con­ vention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political, ec..onomic and social philosophy of black nationalism. After these dele­ gates convene, we will hold a seminar, we will hold dis­ cussions, we will listen to everyone. We want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers. And at that time, if we see fit then to form a black nationalist p arty, we'll form a black nationalist party. If it's necessary to form a black nationalist army, we'll form a black nation­ alist army. It'll be the ballot or the bullet. It'll be liberty or it'll be death.

It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting   some   cracker senators,   Northern crackers   and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D. C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about m y rights. Brothers and sisters, always remember, if it doesn't take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man, it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or Supreme   Court   decisions   to give freedom to the black man. You let that white man know, if this is a country of

4 2                                  Malcolm X Speaks freedom, let it be a country of freedom; and if it's not a country of freedom, change it.

We will work with anybody, anywhere, at any time, who   is   genuinely   interested   in   tackling   the   problem head-on, nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent, but violent when the enemy gets violent. We'll work with you on the voter-registration drive, we'll work with you on rent strikes, we'll work with you on school boycotts - I don't   believe in   any kind of integration; I'm not even worried about it because I know you're not going to get it anyw ay; you're not going to get it because you ' re afraid to die; you've got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white m an, because he'll get just as violent as those crackers in MissISSippi, right here in Cleveland. But we will still work with you on the school boycotts be­ cause   we're against   a   segregated   school   system.   A segregated   school   system produces children who, when they graduate, graduate with crippled minds. But this does not mean that a school is segregated because it's all black. A segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever. Let me explain what I mean. A segregated district or com munity is a community in which people live, but outsiders   control the politics   and the economy of that com munity.   They never refer to the white section as a segregated community. It's the all-Negro section that's a segregated community. Why? The white man controls his own school, his own bank, his own economy, his own politics, his own everything, his own community - but he also controls yours. When you're under someone else's control, you're segregated. They'll always give you the l owest   or the worst that there is to offer, but it doesn't mean you're segregated just because you have your own. You've got to control your own. Just like the white man h as control of his, you need to control yours.

You know the best way to get rid of segregation? The white   man   is   more   afraid   of separation than he   is of integration. Segregation means that he puts you away from him, but not far enough for you to be out of his j urisdiction; separation means you're gone. And the white m an will integrate faster than he'll let you separate. So

The Ballot or the Bullet                               43 we will work with you   against the   segregated school system   because it's   criminal,   because it is   absolutely destructive, in every way imaginable, to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education.

L ast but not least, I must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns. The only thing that I 've ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and   the   property   of   N egroes,   it's   time for   Negroes to defend themselves. Article number two of the constitu­ tional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun. It Js constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle. This doesn't mean you' re going to get a rifle and form b attalions and go out looking for white folks,   although you'd be   within your rights - I mean, you'd be j ustified; but that would be illegal and we don't do   anything illegal. If the white man doesn't want the black man buying rutes and shotguns, then let the govern­ ment do its job. That's all. And don't let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what Malcolm says - why, you old Uncle Tom. He would never ask you if he thought you were going to say, "Amen!"

No, he is making a Tom out of you.

So, this doesn't mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people, but it is time, in 1964, if you are a man, to let that man know. If he's not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the p rotection that our taxes are supposed to be for, s ince he spends all those billions for his defense budget, he certainly can't begrudge you and me spending $ 12 or $ 15 for a single-shot, or double-action. I hope you under­ stand.   Don't   go   out   shooting   people, but   any   time, brothers   and   sisters,   and   especially   the men   in this audience - some of you wearing Congressional Medals of Honor, with shoulders this wide, chests this big, muscles that big - any time you and I sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood, not some grownups, but four little girls while they were praying to the same god the white man taught them to pray to, and you and I see the government go down and can't find who did it.

Why, this man - he can find Eichmann hiding down in

Argentina somewhere. Let two or three American soldiers ,

who are m inding somebody else's business way over in South Vietnam, get killed, and he'll send b attleships, stick ing his nose in their business. He wanted to send troops down to Cuba and make them have what he calls free elections - this old cracker who doesn't have free elections

in his own country. No, if you never see me another time in your life, if I die in the morning, I ' ll die saying one

thing: the ballot or the bullet, the ballot or the bullet. If a Negro in 1 964 has to sit around and w ait for $ome cracker senator to fIlibuster when it comes to the rights of black people, why, you and I should hang our heads in shame. You talk about a march on Washington in 1 963, you haven't seen anything. There' s some more going down in '64. And this time they're not going like they went last year. They' re not going singing 'We Shall Overcome." They're not going with white friends. They're not going with placards already painted for them. They're not going with roundtrip tickets. They're going with on w ay tickets.

And if they don't want that non-nonviolent army going down there, tell them to bring the fIlibuster to a h alt. The

black nationalists aren't going to wait. Lyndon B. Johnson

is the head of the Democratic Party. If he's for civil rights, let him go into the Senate next week and declare himself. Let him go in there right now and declare himself. Let him go in there and denounce the Southern branch of his party. Let him go in there right now and take a moral stand - right now,   not later. Tell him, don't wait until election time.   If he waits too long, brothers and sisters, he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of. In 1 964, it's the ballot or the bullet. Thank you.
