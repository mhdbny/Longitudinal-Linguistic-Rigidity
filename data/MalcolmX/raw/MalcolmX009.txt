I. MESSAGE TO THE GRASS ROOTS

In late 1 963, the Detroit Council for Human Rights announced a Northern Negro Le.adership Conference to be held in Detroit on   November   9 and 1 0. When the council's chairman, Rev. C. L. Franklin, sought to ex­ clude black nationalists and Freedom Now Party advo­ cates from   the conference, Rev.   Albert B. Cleage, Jr., resigned from the council and, in collaboration with the Group On Advanced Leadership (GOAL), arranged for a Northern Negro Grass Roots Leadership Conference. This was held in Detroit at the same time as the more conservative gathering, which was addressed by Congress­ man Adam Clayton Powell among others. The two-day Grass Roots conference was climaxed by a large public rally at   the King   Solomon Baptist Church, with Rev. Cleage, journalist William Worthy and Malcolm X as the chief speakers.   The audience, almost all black and with non-Muslims in the great majority, interrupted Malcolm with applause and laughter so often that he asked it to desist because of the lateness of the hour.

A few weeks after the conference, President Kennedy was assassinated and Elijah Muhammad silenced Mal­ colm   X.    This   is,   therefore,   one of the last   speeches Malcolm gave before leaVing Muhammad's organization. It is the only specimen of his speeches as a Black Mus­ lim included in this book. But it is not a typical Black Muslim speech .. Even though Malcolm continued to preface certain statements with the phrase, "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says," he was increasingly,   in   the period before the split, giving his own special stamp to the Black Muslims' ideas,   including   the idea of   separation. The emphasis of this speech is considerably different from earlier ones   of the type included in Louis E. Lomax's book, When the Word Is Given . . . .

The following selection consists of about one-half of the speech. The long-playing record, "Message to the Grass Roots   by   Malcolm X," published by the Afro-American Broadcasting and Recording Company, Detroit, is vastly superior   to the   written text in conveying the style and personality of Malcolm at his best- when he was speaking to   a militant black audience.

We want to have just an off-the-cuff chat between you and   me, us. We want to talk right down to e arth in a language that everybody here can easily understand. We all agree tonight, all of the speakers have agreed, that America has a very serious problem. Not only does Amer­ ica have a very serious problem, but uur people have a very serious problem. America's problem is us. We're her problem.   The   only reason she has a problem is   she doesn't want us here. And every time you look at yourself, b e you black, brown, red or yellow, a so-called Negro, you represent a person who poses such   a   serious problem for America because you're not wanted. Once you face this as a fact, then you c an start plotting a course that will make you appear intelligent, instead of unintelligent. What   you   and   I   need to;'do is learn to forget our differences. When we come together, we don't come together as B aptists or Methodists.   You don't catch hell because you're a Baptist, and you don't catch hell because you're

a Methodist .   You don't catch hell because you're a Metho­

dist   or   B aptist,   you   don't catch hell because you're a Democrat or a Republican, you don't catch hell because you're a M ason or an Elk, and you sure don't catch hell because   you're   an American;   because if   you were an American, you wouldn't catch hell. You catch hell because you're a black man. You catch hell, all of us catch hell, for the same reason.

So we're all black people, so-called Negroes, second­ clasS' citizens, ex-slaves. You're nothing but. an ex-slave. You don't like to be told that. But what else are you? You are ex-slaves. You didn't come here on the "Mayflower." You came here on a slave ship. In chains, like a horse, or a cow, or a chicken. And you were brought here by the

Message to the Grass Roots                               5

people   who   came   here   on   the "Mayflower,"   you were brought here   by   the   so-called   Pilgrims,   or   Founding Fathers. They were the o nes who brought you here. We have a common enemy. We have this in common: We have a common oppressor, a common exploiter, and a common discriminator. tlut once we all realize that we have a common enemy, then we unite- on the basis of what we have in common. And what we have foremost in common is that enemy- the white man. He's an enemy to all of us. I know some of you all think that some of them aren't   enemies.   Time   will tell.

In B andung b ack in, I think, 1954, was the fIrst unity meeting in centuries of black people. And once you study what happened at the B andung conference, and the results of the B andung conference, it actually serves as a model for   the   same   procedure   you   and I can use to get our problems   solved. At B andung   all the nations came to� gether, the dark nations from   Africa and Asia

them were Buddhists, some of   them were MuslIms, some of them were Christians, some were Confucianists, some were atheists. Despite their religious differences, they came

together.   Some   were   communists, some � ere soda Ii sts,

some were capitalists - despite their economiC and pohhcal differences, they came together. All of them were black, brown, red or yellow.

The number-one thing that was not allowed to attend the Bandung conference was the white man. He Cbuldn't come. Once they excluded the white man, they found that they could get together. Once they kept him out, everybody else fell right in and fell in line. This is the thing that you and I have to understand. And these people who came to­ gether didn't have nuclear weapons, they didn't have jet

p lanes, they didn't have all of the he � vy armaments that

the white man has. But they h ad umty.

They were able to submerge their little petty differences and agree on one thing: That there one African came from

Kenya and was being colonized by the Englishman, � nd

another   African came from the Congo and was bemg colonized by the Belgian, and another African came from Guinea and was being colonized by the French, and an­ other came from Angola and was being colonized by the

Portuguese. When they came to the Bandung conference, they looked at the Portuguese, and at the Frenchman, and at the Englishman, and at the Dutchman, and learned or realized the one thing that all of them had in common - they were all from Europe, they were all Europeans, blond, blue-eyed and white skins. They began to recognize who their enemy was. The same man that was colonizing our people in Kenya was colonizing our people in the Congo. The same one in the Congo was colonizing our people in South Africa, and in Southern Rhodesia, and in Burma, and in India, and in Afghanistan, and in Pakistan. They realized all over the world where the dark man was being oppressed,   he was being oppressed by the white man; where the dark man was being exploited, he was being exploited by the white man. So they got together on this basis-that they had a common enemy.

And when you and I here in Detroit and in Michigan and in   America who have been awakened toda.y look around us, we too realize here in America we a11 have a common enemy,   whether he's in Georgia or Michigan, whether he's in California or New York. He's the same man -blue eyes and blond hair and pale skin -the same man.   So   what we have to do is what they did. They agreed to stop quarreling among themselves. Any little spat· that they had, they'd settle it among themselves, go into a huddle-don't let the enemy know that you've got a disagreement.

Instead of airing our differences in public, we have to realize we're all the same family. And when you have a family squabble, you don't get out on the sidewalk. If you do, everybody calls you uncouth, unrefined, uncivil­ ized, savage.   If you don't make it at home, you settle it at home; you get in the closet, argue it out behind closed doors, and then when you come out on the street, you pose a common front, a united front. And this is what we need to do in the community, and in the city, and in the state. We need to stop airing our differences in front of the white man, put the white man out of our meetings, and then sit down and talk shop with each other. That's what we've got to do.

I would like to make a few comments concerning the

Message to the Grass Roots                              7

difference   between the   black   revolution and the Negro revolution. Are they both the same? And if they're not, what is the difference? What is the difference between a black revolution and a Negro revolution? First, what is a revolution? Sometimes I'm inclined to believe that many of our people are using this word "revolution" loosely, without taking careful consideration of what this word actually means, and what its historic characteristics are. When you study the historic nature of revolutions, the mo­ tive of a revolution, the objective of a revolution, the result of a revolution, and the methods used in a revolut�on, you may change words. You may devise another program, you may change your goal and you may change your mind.

Look at the American Revolution in 1776. That revo­ lution was for what? For land. Why did they want land? Independence. How was it carried out? Bloodshed. Number one, it was based on land, the basis of independence. And the only way they could get it was bloodshed. The French Revolution -what was it based on? The landless against the landlord. What was it for? Land. How did they get it? Bloodshed. Was no love lost, was no compromise, was no negotiation. I'm telling you-you don't know what a rev­ olution is.   Because when you find out what it is, you'll get back in the alley, you'll get out of the way. The Russian Revolution-what was it based on? Land; the landless against the landlord. How did they bring it about?   Bloodshed.   You   haven't got a revolution that doesn't involve bloodshed. And you're afraid to bleed. I said, you're afraid to bleed.

As long as the white man sent you to Korea, you bled. He sent you to Germany, you bled. He sent you to the South Pacific to fight the Japanese, you bled. You bleed for white people, but when it comes to seeing your own churches being bombed and little black girls murdered, ,you haven't got any blood. You bleed when the white man says bleed; you bite when the white man says bite; and you bark when the white man says bark. I hate to say this about us, but it's true. How are you going to be nonviolent in Mississippi, as violent as you were in Korea'! How can you justify being nonviolent in Mississippi and

-----------------------------------------------------Page 7-----------------------------------------------------

Alabama,   when your churches are being bombed, and your little girls are being murdered, and at the same time you are going to get violent with Hitler, and TOjo, and somebody else you don't even know?

If   violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. If it is wrong to be violent defending black wom­ en and black children and black babies and black men, then it is wrong for America to draft us and make us vi­ olent abroad in defense of her. And if it is right for Ameri­

ca to draft us, and teach us how to be violent in defense of her, then it is right for you and me to do whatever is n e c e s s a r y to defend our own people right here in this country.

The    Chinese    Revolution- they wanted   land.   They threw the British out, along with the Uncle Tom Chinese. Yes, they did.   They set a good example. When I was in prison, I read an article    don't be shocked when I say that I was in prison. You're still in prison. That's what America means: prison. When I was in prison, I read an

article in Life magazine showing a little Chinese girl, nine

years old; her father was on his hands and knees and she was   pulling the trigger because he was an Uncle Tom Chinaman. When they had the revolution over there, they took a whole generation of Uncle Toms and just wiped them out.   And within ten years that little girl became a full-grown woman. No more Toms in China. And today it's one of the toughest, roughest, most feared countries on this earth    by the white man.   Because there are no Uncle Toms over there.

Of all our studies, history is best qualified to reward our research. And when you see that you've got problems, all you have to do is examine the historic method used all over the world by others who have problems similar to yours. Once you see how they got theirs straight, then you know how you can get yours straight. There's been a revolution,   a   black   revolution, going on in Africa. In Kenya, the Mau Mau were revolutionary; they were the ones who brought the word "Uhuru" to the fore. The Mau Mau, they were revolutionary, they believed in scorched earth, they knocked everything aside that got in their way, and their revolution also was based on land, a desire for land. In Algeria, the northern part of Africa, a revolution

Message to the Grass Roots                            9

took    place.    The    Algerians   were   revolutionists,   they wanted   land.   France offered   to let them be integrated into France.   They told France, to hell with France, they wanted some land, not some France. And they engaged in a bloody battle.

So I cite these various revolutions, brothers and sis­

ters,   to   show   you that you don't have a peaceful rev­ olution. You don't have a turn-the-other-cheek revolution. There's   no such thing as a nonviolent revolution.   The only kind of revolution that is nonviolent is the Negro revolution. The only revolution in which the goal is loving your enemy is the Negro revolution. It's the only revolu­ tion in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter, a desegregated theater, a desegregated park, and a de­ segregated public toilet; you can sit down next to white folks - on the toilet.   That's no revolution. Revolution is based   on   land.   Land is the basis of all independence. Land is the basis of freedom, justire, and equality. The white man knows what a revolution is. He knows that the black revolution is world-wide in scope and in nature. The black revolution is sweeping Asia, is sweep­ ing   Africa,   is rearing its   head in Latin America. The Cuban Revolution    that's a revolution. They overturned the system. Revolution is in Asia, revolution is in Africa, and the white man is screaming because he sees revolution in Latin America. How do you think he'll react to you when you learn what a real revolution is? You don't know what a revolution is.   If you did, you wouldn't use that word.

Revolution   is   bloody,   revolution   is hostile, revolu­ tion knows no compromise, revolution overturns and de­ stroys everything that gets in its way. And you, sitting around here like a knot on the wall, saying, "I'm going to love these folks no matter how much they hate me." No, you need a revolution. Whoever heard of a revolu­ tion where they lock arms, as Rev. Geage was pointing out beautifully, singing "We Shall Overcome"? You don't do that in a revolution. You don't do any singing, you're too busy swinging. It's based' on land. A revolutionary wants   land   so   he   can   set   up   his   own   nation,   an independent nation. These Negroes aren't asking for any

nution - they're   trying   to   crawl   back   on   the   plan­ tation.

When you want a nation, that's called nationalism. When   the   white man   became involved in a revolution in   this country   against   England, what was it for? He wanted this land so he could set up another white nation. That's white nationalism.   The American Revolution was white nationalism. The French Revolution was white na­ tionalism.   The   Russian   Revolution   too - yes,   it was­ white nationalism.   You don't think so? Why do you think Khrushchev and Mao can't get their heads together? White nationalism. All the revolutions that are going on in Asia and Africa today are based on what ?-black nationalism. A revolutionary is a black nationalist. He wants a nation. I   was   reading some beautiful   words   by Rev.   Cleage, pointing out why he couldn't get together with someone else in the city because all of them were afraid of being identified with black nationalism. If you're afraid of black nationalism, you're afraid of revolution. And if you love revolution, you love black nationalism.

To understand this, you have to go back to what the young brother here referred to as the house Negro and the field Negro back during slavery. There were two kinds of slaves, the house Negro and the field Negro. The house Negroes-they lived in the house with master, they dressed pretty good, they ate good because they ate his food­ w hat he left. They lived in the attic or the basement, but still they lived near the master; and they loved the master more   than   the   master loved himself. They would give their   life   to save the master's house-quicker than the master would.   If the master said, "We got a good house here," the house Negro would say, "Yeah, we got a good house here." Whenever the master said "we," he said "we." That's how you can tell a house Negro.

If the master's house caught on fire, the house Negro would fight harder to put the blaze out than the master would.   If   the   master got sick, the house Negro would say, "What's the matter, boss, we sick?" We sick! He identi­ fied himself with his master, more than his master identified with himself. And if you came to the house Negro and said, "Let's run away, let's escape, let's separate," the house Negro would look at you and say, "Man, you crazy. What

Message to the Grass   Roots                            11

you mean, separate? Where is there a better house than this? Where can I wear better clothes than this? Where can

I eat better food than this?" That was that house Negro.

In those days he was called a "house nigger." And that's

what we   call them today, because we've still . got some

house niggers running around here.

This modern house Negro loves his master. He wants to live near him.   He'll pay three times as much as the house is worth just to live near his master, and then brag about "I'm the only Negro out here." ''I'm the only one on my job." "I'm the only one in this school." You're nothing but a house Negro. And if someone comes to you right now and says, "Let's separate," you say the same thing that the house Negro said on the plantation. "What you mean, separate? From America, this good white man? Where you going to get a better job than you get

1 mean, this is what you say. "1 ain't left nothing in Africa," that's what you say. Why, you left your mind in Africa.

On that same plantation, there was the field Negro. The   field   Negroes-those were the masses. There were always more Negroes in the field than there were Negroes in the house.   The Negro in the field caught hell. He ate leftovers. In the house they ate high up on the hog. The Negro in the field didn't get anything but what was left of the insides of the hog. They call it "chitt'lings" nowa­ days. In those days they called them what they were - guts. That's what you were-gut-eaters. And some of you are still gut-eaters.

The field Negro was beaten from morning to night; he lived in a shack, in a hut; he wore old, castoff clothes. He hated his master. I say he hated his master. He was intelligent. That house Negro loved his master, but that field Negro-remember, they were in the majority, and they   hated   the master. When the house caught on fire, he didn't try to put it out; that field Negro prayed for a wind,   for a breeze. When the master got sick, the field Negro prayed that he'd die. If someone came to the field Negro and said, "Let's separate, let's run," he didn't say "Where   we going?" He'd say, "Any place is better than here."   You've got field Negroes in America today.   I'm a field Negro.   The masses are the field Negroes. When

-----------------------------------------------------Page 9-----------------------------------------------------

they see this man's house on rue, you don't hear the little Negroes talking about "our government is in trouble." They say,   "The government is in trouble."   Imagine a Negro:   "Our government"! I even heard one say "our astronauts." They won't even let him near the plant-and "our astronauts"! "Our Navy"-that's a Negro that is out of his mind, a Negro that is out of his mind.

Just as   the slavemaster of that day used Tom, the house Negro, to keep the field Negroes in check, the sathe old slavemaster today has Negroes who are nothing but modern   Uncle   Toms, twentieth-century Uncle Toms, to keep you and me in check, to keep us under control, keep us passive and peaceful and nonviolent. That's Tom mak­ ing you nonviolent. It's like when you go to the dentist, and the man's going to take your tooth. You're going to fight him when he starts pUlling. So he squirts some stuff in your jaw called novocaine, to make you think they're not doing anything to you. So you sit there and because you've got all of that novocaine in your jaw, you suffer­ peacefully. Blood running an down your jaw, and you don't know what's happening. Because someone has taught you to suffer - peacefully.

The   white man   does   the same thing to you in the street,   when   he wants to put knots on your head and take   advantage   of   you   and   not   have to be afraid of    your    fighting    back.    To    keep    you    from    fight­ ing back, he gets these old religious Uncle Toms to teach you and me,   just   like novocaine, to suffer peacefully. Don't   stop   suffering- just   suffer   peacefully.   As   Rev. Cleage pointed out, they say you should let your blood flow in   the   streets. This is a shame. You know he's a Christian preacher. If it's a shame to him, you know what it is to me.

There   is   nothing   in   our   book,   the   Koran,   that

teaches us to suffer peacefully. Our religion teaches uS to   .

be intelligent.   Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. That's a good religion. In fact, that's that old-time religion. That's the one that Ma and Pa used to talk about: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for    a   tooth,   and   a   head   for   a   head,   and   a   life for a life; That's a good religion. And nobody resents

Message to the Grass Roots                           13

that kind o f religion being taught but a wolf, who intends to make   you his meal.

This is the way it is with the white man in America. He's a wolf-and you're sheep. Any time a shepherd, a pastor,   teaches you and me not to run from the white man and, at the same time, teaches us not to fI8"ht the white man, he's a traitor to you and me. Don't lay down a   life all by itself. No, preserve your life, it's the best thing you've got. And if you've got to give it up, let it be even-steven.

The slavemaster took Tom and dressed him well, fed him well and even gave him a little education - a little education; gave him a long coat and a top hat and made all the other slaves look up to him. Then he used Tom to control them. The same strategy that was used in those days is used today, by the same white man. He takes a Negro,   a so-called   Negro, and makes him prominent, builds him up,   publicizes him, makes him a celebrity. And then he becomes a spokesman for Negroes-and a Negro leader.

I would like to mention just one other thing quickly, and that is the method that the white man uses, how the white man uses the "big guns," or Negro leaders, against the Negro revolution. They are not a part of the Negro revolution. They are used against the Negro revolution. When Martin Luther King failed to desegregate Albany, Georgia, the civll-rights struggle in America reached its low point. King became bankrupt almost, as a leader. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was in fi­ nancial trouble; and it was in trouble, period, with the people when they falled to desegregate Albany. Georgia. Other Negro civil-rights leaders of so-called national stat­ ure became fallen idols.   As they became fallen idols, began to lose their prestige and influence, local Negro leaders began to stir up the masses. In Cambridge, Mary­ land, Gloria Richardson; in Danville, Virginia, and other parts of the country, local leaders began to stir up our pe0- ple at the grass-roots level. This was never done by these Negroes of national stature. They control you, but they have never incited you or excited you. They control you, they contain you, they have kept you on the plantation. As soon as King failed in Birmingham. Negroes took

-----------------------------------------------------Page 10-----------------------------------------------------
﻿
14                            Malcolm X Speaks

to the streets. King went out to C alifornia to a big rally and raised I don't know how many thousands of dollars. He came to Detroit and had a march and raised some more   thousands of dollars. And recall, right after that Roy W ilkins attacked King. He accused King and CORE r Congress Of Racial Equality] of starting trouble every­ where and then making the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoplel get them out of j ail and spend a lot of money; they accused King and CORE of raising all the money and not paying it back. This h appened; I've got it in documented evidence in the newspaper. Roy started attacking King, and King started attacking   Roy,   and   Farmer   started   attacking both of them. And as these Negroes of national stature began to attack each other, they began to lose their control of the Negro masses.

The Negroes were out there in the streets. They were talking about how they were going to march o n Washing­ ton. Right at that time Birmingham had exploded, and the   Negroes   in   Birmingham - remember, they also ex­ ploded. They began to stab the crackers in the back and bust them up 'side their head - yes, they did. That's when Kennedy sent in the troops, down in Birmingham. After that,   Kennedy got on the television and said "this is a moral issue." That's when he said he was going to put out a civil-rights bill. And when he mentioned civil-rights bill and the Southern crackers started talking about how they were going to boycott or filibuster it, then the Negroes started   talking - about what? That they were going to march on W ashington, march on the Senate, march on the White H ouse, march on the Congress, and tie it up, bring it to a h alt, not let the government proceed. They even s aid they were going out to the airport and lay down on the runway and not let any airplanes land. I'm telling you what they said. That was revolution. That was revolution. That was the black revolution.

It was the grass roots out there in the street. It scared the white man to death, scared the white power structure in Washington, D. C., to death; I was there. When they found out that this black steamroller was going to come down on the capital, they called 'in Wilkins, they called in Randolph, they called in these national Negro leaders that

Message to the Grass Roots                             15

you respect and told them, "Call it off." Kennedy said, "Look, you all are letting this thing go too far." And Old Tom said, "Boss, I can't stop it, because I didn't start it." I'm telling you what they said.   They said, "I'm not even in it, much less at the head of it." They said. "These Negroes are doing things on their own. They're running ahead of us." And that old shrewd fox, he said, " If you all aren't in it, I'll put you in it. I'll put you at the head of it. I'll endorse it. I'll welcome it. I'll help it. I'll join it," A matter of hours went by. They had a meeting at the Carlyle   Hotel in New York City. The C arlyle Hotel is owned by the Kennedy family; that's the hotel Kennedy spent the night at, two nights ago; it belongs to his family. A philanthropic society headed by a white man named Stephen Currier called all the top civil-rights leaders to­ gether at the Carlyle Hotel. And he told them, "By you all fighting each other, you are destroying the civil-rights movement. And since you're fighting over money from white liberals, let us set up what is known as the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership. Let's form this council, and all the civil-rights organizations will belong to it, and we'll use it for fund-raising purposes." Let me show you how   tricky   the white man is.   As soon   as   they   got it formed, they elected Whitney Young as its chairman, and who do you think became the co-chairman? Stephen Currier, the white man, a millionaire. Powell was talking about it down at Cobo Hall today. This is what he was t alking about. Powell knows it happened. Randolph knows it happened. Wilkins knows it happened. King knows it happened .   Every   one   of   that   Big   Six - they know it happened.

Once they formed it, with the white man over it, he promised   them and   gave them   $800,000 to split up among the Big Six; and told them that after the march was over they'd give them $700, 000 more. A million and a half dollars- split up between leaders that you have been following, going to jail for, crying crocodile tears for. And they're nothing but Frank J ames and Jesse James and the what-do-you-call-'em brothers.

As soon as they got the setup organized, the white man made available to them top public-relations experts; opened the news media across the country at their disposal, which

then began to project these Big Six as the leaders of the march. Originally they weren't even in the march. You were talking this march talk on Hastings Street, you were talking march talk on Lenox Avenue, and on Fillmore Street, and on Central Avenue, and 32nd Street and 63rd Street. That's where the march talk was being talked. But the white man put the Big Six at the head of it; made them the march. They became the march. They took it over.

And the first move they made after they took it over, they

invited W alter Reuther, a white man; they invited a priest, a   rabbi,   and an old white preacher, yes, an old white preacher. The s ame white element that put Kennedy into power - labor, the Catholics, the Jews, and liberal Protes­ tants; the same clique that put Kennedy in power, joined the march on Washington.

It's just like when you've got some coffee that's too black,   which   means it's   too strong. What do you do? You integrate it with cream, you make it weak. But if you p our too much cream in it, you won't even know you ever had coffee.   It used to be hot, it becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to wake you up, now it puts you to sleep. This is what they did with the march on Washington. They j oined it. They didn't integrate it, they infIltrated it. They j oined it, became a part of it, took it   over.   And   as they took it over, it lost its militancy. It ceased to be angry, it ceased to be hot, it ceased to be uncompromising. Why, it even ceased to be a march. It became   a   picnic,   a circus.   Nothing but a circus, with clowns and all. You had one right here in Detroit - I saw it on television - with clowns leading it, white clowns and black clowns. I know you don't like what I ' m saying, but I ' m going to tell you anyway. Because I can prove what I ' m saying. If you think I ' m telling you wrong, you bring me Martin Luther King and A. Philip Randolph and James Farmer and those other three, and see if they'll deny it

over a microphone.                            .

No, it was a sellout. It was a takeover. When James

B aldwin came in from Paris, they wouldn't let him talk,

because they couldn't make him go by the script. Burt L ancaster read the speech that B aldwin was supposed to make; they wouldn't let B aldwin get up there, because they know B aldwin is liable to say anything. They con-

trolled it so tight, they told those Negroes what time to hit town, how to come, where to stop, what signs to carry, what song to sing, what speech they could make, and what speech they couldn't make; and then told them to .get out of town by sundown. And every one of those Toms was out of town by sundown. Now I know you don't like my saying this. But I can back it up. It was a circus, a performance that beat anything Hollywood could ever do, the performance of the year. Reuther and those other three devils should get an Academy Award for the best actors because they   acted like they really loved Negroes and fooled a whole lot of Negroes. And the six Negro leaders should get an award too, for the best supporting cast.
