II. A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE

Elijah Muhammad suspended Malcolm X on December 4, 1 963, ostensibly for making an unauthorized remark about the assassination of President Kennedy. Actually, differences had   been developing for some time between Malcolm and the more conservative elements in the Black Muslim leadership. The only hint of these, in the subse­ quent three months when Malcolm made no public state­ ments, came when he was interviewed by Louis E. Lo max in December,   1 963.   While denying differences with Mu­ hammad    and    expressing    continued   loyalty   to   him, Malcolm stated that "the younger Black Muslims," lacking Muhammad's "divine patience" with the enemy, "want to see some action." The implication was that they were being restrained by the leadership.

On March 8, 1 964, Malcolm announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam and was organizing a new movement.   He said that the Black Muslim movement had "gone as far as it can" because it was too narrowly sectarian and too inhibited. He also said: "1 am prepared t o cooperate in local civil-rights actions in the South and elsewhere and shall do so because every campaign for spe­ cific objectives can only heighten the political consciousness of the Negroes and intensify their identification against white society. . . . There is no use deceiving ourselves. G ood education, housing and jobs are imperatives for the Negroes, and I shall support them in their fight to win these objectives,   but I shall tell the Negroes that while these are necessary, they cannot solve the main Negro problem."

On March 1 2, he held a formal press conference c:t

the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York in order to explam his new position in greater detail. Before opening the floor to questions by reporlers, he read the following prepared

statement. It i s included here a s an index t o Malcolm's thinking   at   that time,   which   was to. undergo further changes in the remaining eleven months of his life. Malcolm said in this statement that he was and u)ould remain a Muslim; and he did. But a few weeks later he was to go to Mecca and return with a different under­ standing of Islam, particularly in the sphere of race. Hoping and trying to avoid conflict u:Jith the Black Muslims,   he still praised Muhammad in this statement for his a nalysis and program, and declined to discuss the "internal differences" that had "forced" him out of the Nation of Islam, Later, after Muhammad began to as­ sail him publicly, he was to regret this: "1 made an error, I know now, in not speaking out the full truth when I was first 'suspended. ,"

Previously, Malcolm had held that "separation" was the

only solution. Now, on March 1 2, he cal � ed separation int   o..

. .

and he weakened this further by calling it "still a long­ range program." By May, 1 964, he was to discontinue altogether any advocacy of a separate nation, and to say he thought Negroes should stay in the United States and fight for what was rightfully theirs.

As a Black Muslim, he had equated "black nat�()llalism" and "separation." In the press statement proclaiming him­ self to be a black nationalist, however, he differentiated the

two concepts, defining black nationalism in such a way u.s

to include non-separatists too, In the final months of hIS l�fe he was seeking for a term to descril)e his philosophy that would be more precise and more complete than black nationalism.

The press statement expressed Malcolm's intention to organize the Muslim Mosque, Inc"   "in such manner [as] to provide for the active pW'ticipation of all Negroes . despite   their   religious   or non-religious   belie/s."   Three months later he was to decide that the achievement of this aim required the formation of another group, the broader, secular Organization of Afro-American Unity,

This March 1 2 statement, therefore, should be read as a transitional phase in the development of Malcolm's ideas, marking important changes from his Black Muslim past,

a separate nation or a return to AfriCa lhe best soiutzon,

but not representing all the conclusions he reached before his death.

Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for human   rights,    I   have   called this press conference this morning in order to clarify my own position in the strug­ gle - especially in regard to politics and nonviolence. I   am and always will be a Muslim. My religion is Islam.   I still believe that Mr. Muhammad's analysis of the problem is the most realistic, and that his solution is the best one. This means that I too believe the best solution is complete separation, with our people going back home, to our own African homeland.

But   separation   back to Africa is still a long-range program, and while it is yet to materialize, 22 million of our people who are still here in America need better food, clothing, housing, education and jobs right now. Mr. Mu­ hammad's program does point us back homeward, but it also contains within it what we could and should be doing to help solve many of our own problems while we are still here.

Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it   has   happened, I intend to make the most of it.

Now that I have more independence of action, I intend

to   use   a   more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem.

I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field - but I am sincere, and my sin­ cerity is my credentials.

I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organiza­ tions.   We   must   find   a   common approach, a common solution, to a common problem. As of this minute, I've forgotten everything bad that the other leaders have said about me, and I pray they can also forget the many bad things I've said about them.

A Declaration of Independence                        21

The   problem   facing our people here i n America is bigger than all other personal or organizational differ­ ences. Therefore, as leaders, we must stop worrying about the threat that we seem to think we pose to each other's personal prestige, and concentrate our united efforts to­ ward solving the unending hurt that is being done daily to our people here in America.

I am going to organize and head a new mosque in

New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necess ary

.

to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fIber of our community.

Our   political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nation­ alism. Our cultural emphasis will be black nationalism. Many of our people aren't religiously inclined, so the Muslim Mosque, Inc., will be organized in such manner to provide for the active participation of all Negroes in our political, economic, and social programs, despite their religious or non-religious beliefs.

The political philosophy of black nationalism   means: we must control the politics. and the politicians   of our community. They must no longer take orders from   outside forces. We will .organize, and sweep out of office all   Negro politicians who are puppets for the outside forces.

Our accent will be upon youth: we need new ideas, new methods, new approaches. We will call upon young students of political science throughout the nation to help us. We will encourage these young students to launch their own independent study, and then give us their analysis and their suggestions. We are completely disenchanted with the old, adult, esta blished politicians. We want to see some new faces - more militant faces.

Concerning the 1964 elections: we will keep our plans on this a secret until a later date- but we don't intend for our people to be the victims of a political sellout again in 1964.

The Muslim Mosque, Inc., will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity. There can be no

workers' solidarity until there is flrst some racial solidarity. We cannot think of uniting with others, until after we have first united among ourselves. We cannot think of being ac­ ceptable to others until we have flrst proven acceptable to ourselves. One can't unite bananas with scattered leaves. Concerning nonviolence: it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks. It is legal and lawful to own a shotgun or a rifle. We believe in obeying the law.

In areas where our people are the constant victims of brutality, and the government seems unable or unwilling to protect them, we should form rifle clubs that can be used to defend our lives and our property in times of emergency. such as happened last year in Birmingham; Plaquemine, Louisiana; Cambridge. Maryland; and Dan­ ville, Virginia. When our people are being bitten by dogs, they are within their rights to kill those dogs.

We should be peaceful, law-abiding-but the time has come for the American Negro to fight back in self-defense whenever and wherever he is being unjustly and unlawfully attacked.

If the government thinks I am wrong for saying this,

then let the government start doing its job.
