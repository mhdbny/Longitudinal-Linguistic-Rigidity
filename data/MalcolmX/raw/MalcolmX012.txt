IV . THE BLACK REVOLUT ION

On April 8, 1 964, Malcolm X gave a speech on "The Black Revolution" at a meeting sponsored by the Militant Labor Forum at Palm Gardens in New York. This forum is connected with The Militant, a socialist weekly, which Malcolm considered "one of the best newspapers anywhere. " The audience was around three-quarters white. Most of it responded favorably to the talk. There were some sharp exchanges    during   the   discussion period   between   the speaker and white liberals who resented his attacks on liberalism and the Democratic Party and tried to pin the label of hatem onger on him.

The talk gave Malcolm an opportunity for a fuller presentation of his arguments for internationalizing the b lack struggle by indicting the United States government before the United Nations for racism. It is notable also for his statement that a "bloodless revolution" was still possible in the United States under certain circumstances.

Friends and enemies: Tonight I hope that we can have a little fireside chat with as few sparks as possible being tossed around. Especially because of the very explosive condition that the world is in today. Sometimes, when a person's house is on fire and someone comes in yelling fire, instead of the person who is awakened by the yell being   thankful,   he makes the mistake of charging the one who awakened him with having set the tire. I hope that   this   little   convers ation   tonight   about   the   black revolution won't   cause m any of you to accuse us   of igniting it when you find it at your doorstep. . . . During recent years there has been much talk about a population explosion. W henever they are speaking of the population explosion, in my opinion they are referring primarily to the people in Asia or in Africa - the black,

to you may represent a small minority in the so-called Negro community. But they just happen to be composed of the type of ingredient necessary to fuse or ignite the entire black community.

And this is one thing that whites - whether you call yourselves liberals or conservatives or racists or whatever else you might choose to b e - one thing that you have to realize   is,   where the   black   community is concerned, although the large majority you come in contact with may impress you as being moderate and patient and loving and long-suffering and all that kind of stuff, the minority who you consider to be Muslims or nationalists happen to b e made of the type of ingredient that can easily spark the black community. This should be understood. Because to me a powder keg is nothing without a fuse.

1 964 wilJ. be America's hottest year; her hottest year yet; a year of much racial violence and much racial blood­ shed. But it won't be blood that's going to flow only on one side. The new generation of black people that have grown up in this country during recent years are already forming the o pinion, and it's a just opinion, that if there is to be bleeding, it should be reciprocal - bleeding on both sides.

It should also be understood that the racial sparks that are ignited here in America today could easily turn into a flaming fire abroad, which means it could engulf all the people of this earth into a giant race war. You can­ not confme it to   one little neighborhood, or one little community, or one little country. What happens to a black man in America today h appens to the black man in Africa. What happens to   a black man in America and Africa h appens to the black man in Asia and to the man down in Latin America. What happens to one of us today hap­ pens to all of us. A nd when this is realized, I think that the whites - who are intelligent even if they aren't moral or   aren't just or   aren't impressed by legalities - those who are intelligent will realize that when they touch this one, they are touching all of them, and this in itself will have a tendency to be a checking factor.

The seriousness of this situation must be faced up to. I was in Cleveland last night, Cleveland, Ohio. In fact I

was there Friday, Saturday and yesterday. Last Friday the warning was given that this is a year of bloodshed, that the black man has ceased to turn the other cheek, that he has ceased to be nonviolent, that he h as ceased to feel that he must · be confined by all these restraints that are put upon him by white society in struggling for what white society says he was supposed to have had a hundred years ago.

So today, when the black man starts reaching out for what America says are his rights, the black man feels that he is within his rights - when he becomes the victim of brutality by those who are depriving him of his rights ­ to do whatever is necessary to protect himself. An example of this w as taking place last night at this same time in Cleveland, where the police were putting water hoses on our people there and also throwing tear gas at them - and they met a hail of stones, a hail of rocks, a hail of bricks. A couple of weeks ago in Jacksonville, Florida, a young teen-age Negro was throwing Molotov cocktails. Well, Negroes didn't do this ten years ago. But what you should learn from this is that they are waking up. It was stones yesterday, Molotov cocktails today; it will be hand grenades tomorrow and whatever else is av ailable the next da.y. The seriousness of this situation must be faced up to. You should not feel that I am inciting some­ one   to   violence. I'm only   warning   of   a   powder-keg situation. You   can take it or leave it. H you take the warning, perhaps you can still save yourself. But if you ignore it   or ridicule it, well, death is already at your doorstep. There are 22 million African-Americans who are ready to fight for independence right here. When I say fight for independence right here, I don't mean any non­ violent fight, or turn-the-other-cheek fight. Those days are gone. Those days are over.

If George W ashington didn't get independence for this country nonviolently, and if Patrick Henry didn't come up with a nonviolent statement, and you taught me to look upon them as patriots and heroes, then it's time for you to realize that I have studied your books well . . . . 1964 will see the Negro revolt evolve and merge into the world-wide black revolution that has been taking place

50                                   Malcolm   X Speaks on this earth since 1 945. The so-called revolt will become a real black revolution. Now the black revolution has been taking place in Africa and Asia and Latin America; when I   say black,   I mean non-white - black, brown, red or yellow.   Our   b rothers   and sisters   in   Asia, who were colonized by the Europeans, our brothers and sisters in Africa, who were colonized by the Europeans, and in Latin America,   the peasants, who were colonized by the Eu­ ropeans, have been involved in a struggle since 1 945 to get the colonialists, or the colonizing powers, the Euro­ peans, off their land, out of their country.

This is a real revolution. Revolution is always based on land. Revolution is never based on begging somebody for   an   integrated cup   of coffee. Revolutions are never fought by turning the other cheek. Revolutions are never . b ased   upon   Iove-your-enemy   and   pray-for-those-who­ spitefully-use-you.   And   revolutions   are   never   waged singing   "We   Shall   Overcome." Revolutions   are based upon bloodshed.   Revolutions   are never compromising. Revolutions are never based upon negotiations. Revolu­ tions   are   never   based   upon   any   kind   of   tokenism whatsoever.   Revolutions are never even based upon that which is begging a corrupt society or a corrupt system to a ccept us into it. Revolutions overturn systems. And there is no system on this e arth which has proven itself more corrupt, more criminal, than this system that in 1 964 still colonizes 22 million African-Americans, still enslaves 22 million Afro-Americans.

There   is   no   system   more   corrupt than   a system that   represents   itself   as   the   example   of freedom,   the example of democracy, and can go all over this earth telling other   people how to straighten out their house, when you have citizens of this country who have to use bullets if they want to cast a ballot.

The greatest weapon the colonial powers have used in the past against our people has always been divide-and­ conquer. America is a colonial power. She has colonized 22 million Afro-Americans by depriving us of first-class citizenship,   by depriving us of civil rights, actually by depriving us of human rights. She has not only deprived us of the right to be a citizen, she has deprived us of the right to be human beings. the right to be recognized and

The Black Revolution                                  51

respected a s men and women. I n this country the · black can be fd'ty years old and he is still a "boy."

I grew up with white people. I was integrated before they even invented the word and I have never met white people yet - if you are around them long enough - who won't refer to you as a "boy" or a "gal," no matter how old you are or what school you came out of. no m atter what your   intellectual   or   professional level is.   In this society we remain ''boys.''

So   America's   strategy is the same strategy as that which was used in the past by the colonial powers: divide and conquer.   She   plays one Negro leader against the other. She plays one Negro organization against the other. She m akes us think we have different objectives, different goals.    As soon as one Negro says something. she runs to this Negro and asks him, "What do you think about what he said?" Why. anybody can see through that today - except some of the Negro leaders.

All   of our people have the same goals, the   same objective.   That objective is freedom. justice, equality. All of us want recognition and respect as human beings. We don't want to be integrationists. Nor do we want to be separationists. We want to be human beings. Integration is only a method that is used by some groups to obtain freedom, j ustice, equality and respect as human beings. Separation is only a method that is used by other groups to obtain freedom, justice, equality or human dignity. Our people have made the mistake of confusing the methods with the objectives. As long as we agree on ob­ jectives,   we   should   never fall out with each other just because   we believe in different methods   or tactics or strategy to reach a common objective.

We have to keep in mind at all times that we are not fighting for integration, nor are we fighting for separation. We are fighting for recognition as human beings. We are fighting for the right to live as free humans in this society. .' In fact, we are actually fighting for rights that are even

greater than civil rights and that is human rights. Among the so-called Negroes in this country, as a rule the   civil-rights   groups,   those who believe in civil rights, spend most of their time trying to prove they are

Americans. Their thinking is usually domestic, confined to the boundaries of America, and they always look upon themselves as a minority. When they look upon themselves upon the American stage, the American stage is a white stage. So a black man standing on that stage in America automatically is in the minority. He is the underdog, and in his struggle he always uses an approach that is a begging, hat-in-hand, compromising approach.

Wherea� the other segment or section in America, known as the black nationalists, are more interested in human rights than they are in civil rights. And they place more stress on human rights than they do on civil rights. The difference between the thinking and the scope of the Negroes who are involved in the human-rights struggle and those who are involved in the civil-rights struggle is that those so-called Negroes involved in the human-rights struggle don't look upon themselves as Americans. They look upon themselves as a part of dark man­ kind. They see the whole struggle not within the confmes of the American stage, but they look upon the struggle on the world stage. And, in the world context, they see that the dark man outnumbers the white man. On the world stage the white man is just a microscopic minority. So in this   country you find two different types of Afro-Americans-the type who looks upon himself as a minority and you as the majority, because his scope is limited to the American scene; and then you have the type who looks upon himself as part of the majority and you as part of a microscopic minority. And this one uses a different approach in trying to struggle for his rights. He doesn't beg. He doesn't thank you for what you give him, because you are only giving him what he should have had a hundred years ago. He doesn' t think you are doing him any favors.

He doesn't see any progress that he has made since the Civil War. He sees not one iota of progress because, number one, if the Civil War had freed him, he wouldn't need civil-rights legislation today. If the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by that great shining liberal called Lincoln, had freed him, he wouldn't be singing "We Shall Overcome" today. If the amendments to the Constitution

The Black Revolution                                  53

had solved his problem, his problem wouldn't still be here today. And if the Supreme Court desegregation decision of 1 954 was genuinely and sincerely designed to solve his

problem, his problem wouldn't be with us today. So this kind of black man is thinking. He can see where every maneuver that America has made, supposedly to solve this problem, has been nothing but political trick­ ery and treachery of the worst order. Today he doesn't have any confidence in these so-called liberals. (1 know that   all   that   have   come   in   here   tonight don't   call yourselves liberals. Because that's a nasty name today. It represents hypocrisy. ) So these two different types of black people exist in the so-called Negro community and they are beginning to wake up and their awakening is producing a very dangerous situation.

.

You have whites in the community who express SlD­ cerity when they say they want to help. Well, how can they help? How can a white person help the black man solve his problem? Number one, you can't solve it for him. You can help him solve it, but you can't solve it for him today. One of the best ways that you can help him solve it is to let the so-called Negro, who has been involved in the civil-rights struggle, see that the civil-rights struggle must

be expanded beyond the level of Civil rights   � o hu man

. .

rights. Once it is expanded beyond the level of clvil nghts to the level of human rights, it opens the door for all of our brothers and sisters in Africa and Asia, who have their independence, to come to our rescue.

When you go to Washington, D.C., expecting those crooks down there-and that's what they are-to pass some kind of   civil-rights legislation to correct a very criminal situation, what you are doing is encouraging the black man, who is the victim, to take his case into the court that's controlled by the criminal that made him the victim.   It will never be solved in that way . . . . The civil-rights struggle involves the black man taking his case to the white man's court. But when he fi,ghts it at the human-rights level, it is a different situation. It opens the door to take Uncle Sam to the world court. The black man doesn't have to go to court to be free. Uncle Sam should be taken to court and made to tell why the black

-----------------------------------------------------Page 29-----------------------------------------------------

man    is   not   free   in   a   so-called   free   society.    Uncle Sam should be taken into the United Nations and charged with violating the UN charter of human rights. You can forget Civil rights. How are you going to get civil rights with men like Eastland and men like Dirksen and   men   like Johnson? It has to be taken out of their hands and taken into the hands of those whose power and authority exceed theirs. Washington has become too cor­ rupt. U ncle Sam has become bankrupt when it comes to a conscience - it is impossible for Uncle Sam to solve the problem of 22 million black people in this country. I t is absolutely   impossible   to do it in   Uncle Sam's courts - whether it is the Supreme Court or any other kind of court that comes under Uncle Sam's jurisdiction.

The   only alternative   that   the black   man   has   in America today is to take it out of Senator Dirksen's and Senator   Eastland's and President Johnson's jurisdiction . and   take   it   downtown   on   the East River and place it before that body of men who represent international law, and let them know that the human rights of black people are being violated in a country that professes to be the m oral leader of the free world.

Any   time   you have   a filibuster in America, in the Senate, in 1 964 over the rights of 22 million black people, over the citizenship of 22 million black people, or that will   affect the   freedom and   justice and equality of 22 million black people. it's time for that government itself to be taken before a world court. How can you condemn South Africa? There are only 1 1 million of our people in South Africa, there are 22 million of them here. And we are receiving an injustice which is just as criminal as that   which is   being done to the black people of South Africa.

So today those whites who profess to be liberals - and as   far   as   I am concerned it's just lip-profession- you understand why our people don't have civil rights. You're white. You can go and hang out with another white liberal and see how hypocritical they are. A lot of you Sitting right here know that you've seen whites up in a Negro's face with flowery words, and as soon as that Negro walks away you listen to how your white friend talks. We have

The Black Revolution                                  55

black people who can pass as white. We know how you talk.

We can see that it is nothing but a governmental con� spiracy   to   continue to deprive the black people in this country of their rights. And the only way we will get these rights restored is by taking it out of Uncle Sam's hands. Take him   to   court and charge him with genocide, the mass murder of millions of black people in this country - political   m urder,   economic   murder.   social   murder, mental murder. This is the crime that this government has committed, and if you yourself don't do something abQut it in time, you are going to open the doors for something to be done about it from outside forces.

I   read   in   the paper yesterday   where   one   of   the Supreme Court j ustices, Goldberg, was crying about the violation   of . human   rights   of   three   million   Jews   in the Soviet Union. Imagine this.   I haven't got anything against Jews. but that's their problem. How in the world are you going to cry about problems on the other side of the world when you haven't got the problems straightened out here?   How can the plight of three million Jews in Russia be qualified to be taken to the United Nations by a   man who   is a justice in this Supreme Court, . and is supposed to be a liberal, supposed to be a friend of black people, and hasn't opened up his mouth one time about taking the plight of black people down here to the United

Nations? . . .

If Negroes could vote south of the - yes, if Negroes could vote south of the Canadian border- south South, if Negroes   could   vote in the southern part of the South, Ellender wouldn't be the head of the Agricultural and Forestry Committee, Richard Russell wouldn't be head of the   Armed   Services   Committee,   Robertson   of Virginia wouldn't be head of the Banking and Currency Commitee. Imagine that, all of the banking and currency of the gov­

ernment is in the hands of a cracker.

In fact, when you see how many of these committee men are fro m the S outh, you can see that we have nothing but a cracker government in Washington, D.C. And their head is a cracker president. I said a cracker president.

.

Texas is just as much a cracker state as Mississippi. . .

The first thing this man did when he came in office was   invite   all the big Negroes down for coffee. James F armer was one of the first ones, the head of CORE. I have nothing against him. He's all right - F armer, that is. But could that same president h ave invited James F armer to Texas for coffee? And if James Farmer went to Texas, could he have taken his white wife with him to have coffee with the president? Any time you have a man who can't straighten out Texas, how can he straighten out the coun­ try? No, you're b arking up the wrong tree.

If Negroes   in the   South could vote, the Dixiecrats would   lose p ower. When the Dixiecrats lost power, the Democrats would lose power. A Dixiecrat lost is a Demo­ crat lost. Therefore the two of them have to conspire with each other to stay in power. The Northern Dixiecrat puts all the blame on the Southern Dixiecrat. It's a con game, a giant political con game. The job of the Northern Demo­ crat is to make the Negro think that he is our friend. He is always smiling and wagging his tail and telling us how much he can do for us if we vote for him. But at the same time that he's out in front telling us what he's going to do, behind the door he's in cahoots with the Southern Demo­ crat setting up the machinery to make sure he'll never have to keep his promise.

This is the conspiracy that our people have faced in this country for the past hundred years. And today you have a new generation of black people who have come on the scene,   who have become disenchanted with the entire   system,   who   have become disillusioned over the system, and who are ready now and willing to do some­ thing about it.

So,   in my conclusion, in speaking about the black revolution, America today is at a time or in a day or at an hour where she is the first country on this earth that can   actually   have   a bloodless revolution. In the past, revolutions have been bloody. Historically you just don't have a peaceful revolution. Revolutions are bloody, revolu­ tions are violent, revolutions cause bloodshed and death follows in their paths. America is the only country in his­ tory   in . a position to bring about a revolution without

The Black Revolution                                  57

violence   and bloodshed.   But America   is   not morally equipped to do so.

Why is America in a position to bring about a blood­ less revolution? Because the Negro in this country holds the balance of power, and if the Negro in this country were given what the Constitution says he is supposed to have, the added power of the Negro in this country would sweep   all of the   racists   and the segregationists out of office. It would change the entire political structure of the country.   It would wipe out the Southern segregationism that   now   controls America's foreign policy, as well as America' s domestic policy.

And the only way without bloodshed that this can be brought about is that the black man has to be given full use of the ballot in every one of the fIfty states. But if the black m an doesn't get the b allot, then you are going to be faced with another man who forgets the ballot and starts using the bullet.

Revolutions are fought to get control of land, to re­ move the absentee landlord and gain control of the land and the institutions that flow from that land. The black man   has   been in a very low condition because    he has had no control whatsoever over any land. He has been   a   beggar   economically,   a   beggar   politically,   a beggar socially, a beggar even when it comes to trying to get some education. The p ast type of mentality, that was developed in this colonial system among our people

today is   being   overcome.   And as   the   young one �

come up, they know what they want. And as they listen to your beautiful preaching   about democracy and all those other flowery words, they know what they're sup · posed to have.

So you have a people today who not only know what they want, but also know what they are supposed to have. And they themselves are creating another generation that is coming up that not only will know what it wants and know   what   it   should have,   but   also will be   ready and willing to do whatevet is necessary to see that what

th ey should have materializes immediately. Thank you.
