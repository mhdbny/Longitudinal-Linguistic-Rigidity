Texas moved to dismiss its appeal today in its lawsuit that sought to block the federal government and a nonprofit relief organization from resettling Syrian refugees in the state. Courts have repeatedly ruled against anti-resettlement efforts in Texas, Alabama, and Indiana. The American Civil Liberties Union, along with the ACLU of Texas, National Immigration Law Center, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Susman Godfrey LLP, is representing the International Rescue Committee in the Texas case.

The Texas attorney general’s decision comes days after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled, in another case litigated by the ACLU, that a similar policy by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence violated the Equal Protection Clause.  

Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel for the International Rescue Committee, had this response to Texas’ dismissal:

“In backing down, Texas appears to have recognized that the federal courts have been unanimous in rejecting these discriminatory and illegal policies. Other states should heed the lesson that these discriminatory anti-refugee policies are a dead end.”
