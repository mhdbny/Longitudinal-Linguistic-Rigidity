Sunday, September 4, 2011  Sermon Outline...page 1  "Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men; So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him; for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR REPORT? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was there any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, HE SHALL SEE HIS SEED, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors." Isa. 52:13-15; & 53:1-12.  This passage of Scripture ­ (i.e., Isaiah, from the last three verses of chapter 52, and including all twelve verses of chapter 53) ­ has been called by most good Bible expositors The Gospel According To Isaiah. And I do not call any man a good Bible expositor who is not a thorough-going Calvinist. Which brings us to the "L" in TULIP, standing for LIMITED ATONEMENT. Which means ­ flat out ­ that our dear Lord Jesus did NOT die for all mankind (!) And, in fact, He did not shed His precious blood to atone for the sins of any but "a very small remnant" of mankind, called  His Elect, His Sheep, His Seed, etc. Any who fail to get this doctrine straight cannot get ANY  doctrine straight.  John Owen, the greatest theologian of them all used to say in preaching to Cromwells army, that  Christ: either died for ALL the sins of all men (which makes you a Unitarian-Universalist, holding  that all men are saved and going to Heaven); for SOME of the sins of all men (in which case,  NOBODY would be saved and go to Heaven); or, ALL the sins of SOME men (which is true, and only Gods Elect will be saved and go to Heaven). Christ died only for His Sheep ­ not one drop of His precious blood was shed for a single goat; not one drop of His precious blood was shed for a single dog; and, not one drop of His precious blood was shed for a single hog. Are you here, Mr. Arminian, who would drain every drop of His precious blood from His precious body as it hung on the Cruel Cross, and give that which is holy unto the dogs (Mat. 7:6)?  Beloved, we have unearthed a great and heinous sin. I am preaching to every Arminian preacher in the world. It is a very serious thing that you do ­ spreading damnable lies about the blood of the everlasting covenant; to wit: that Jesus died for every individual of mankind from Adam to the end of the world; then giving your Satanic lie a tidy theological name so as to make your lie respectable ­ i.e., Universal Atonement.  Sunday, September 4, 2011  Sermon Outline...page 2  I dont care how many theological colleges and seminaries Satan has duped into parroting your BIG  LIE. You preach that stuff and you are going to Hell. Period. You are sinning willfully, and you are doing deadly despite to the Spirit of grace with every breath you take; to wit:  "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses; Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, AND HATH COUNTED THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge (avenge) his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." (Heb. 10:26-31)  In the context, the willful sinning that brings down the vengeful wrath of God and the fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation ­ is the dreadful sin of preaching lies, Arminian lies, and more particularly, the heinous false doctrine of the UNIVERSAL ATONEMENT (i.e., that Christ shed His precious blood for every individual of mankind). Thus you see that this matter of preaching false doctrine is far more serious than exchanging pleasant little Bible College debating points. Beloved, surely you see now, if you doubted before, that when I tell every Arminian in the world that he is going to Hell for preaching lies ­ I MEAN EXACTLY THAT.  For many years down south Calvinistic Baptists were CALLED PARTICULAR BAPTISTS, because they clung tenaciously to the doctrine of the PARTICULAR ATONEMENT; meaning that the Savior shed His precious blood only for PARTICULAR PEOPLE, known with great specificity by the Father from the foundation of the world, and identified one by one, with exactness, at the time the mighty transaction was "finished" on Golgothas Brow; to wit: "When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see His seed." Isa. 53:10. Upon the Cross, the suffering Savior, somehow, saw each and every one of His little sheep, for whom He was then and there paying the price for their redemption. "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied..." "It is finished" - Jn. 19:30.  The whole glorious transaction pleased and satisfied the Father and the Son in each specific case; to wit: "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, HE SHALL SEE HIS SEED (AND EVERY ONE OF THEM, ALL OF HIS ELECT, INDIVIDUALLY), he shall prolong his days (however long it takes), and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. HE SHALL SEE OF THE TRAVAIL OF HIS SOUL, AND SHALL BE SATISFIED ­ (HOW GLORIOUS A THING IS THIS [!] WHEN OUR DEAR LORD JESUS HUNG UPON THE CRUEL CROSS IN THE UTMOST TRAVAIL OF HIS SOUL, HE SOMEHOW SAW EACH OF HIS ELECT FOR WHOM HE WAS THEN AND THERE DYING AND SHEDDING HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD ­ NOT ONE MORE AND NOT ONE LESS ­ AN EXACT NUMBER ­ AND HE CALLETH EACH OF HIS BLESSED SHEEP BY NAME [JN. 10:11-14,26-30; TO WIT: "I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD; THE GOOD SHEPHERD GIVETH HIS LIFE FOR THE SHEEP. BUT HE THAT IS AN HIRELING (I.E., AN ARMINIAN), AND NOT THE SHEPHERD, WHOSE OWN THE SHEEP ARE NOT, SEETH THE WOLF COMING, AND LEAVETH THE SHEEP, AND FLEETH; AND THE WOLF CATCHETH THEM, AND SCATTERETH THE SHEEP. THE HIRELING FLEETH, BECAUSE HE IS AN HIRELING, AND CARETH NOT FOR THE SHEEP. I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD, AND KNOW MY SHEEP, AND AM KNOWN OF MINE. ...BUT YE BELIEVE NOT, BECAUSE YE ARE NOT OF MY SHEEP, AS I SAID UNTO YOU. MY SHEEP HEAR  Sunday, September 4, 2011  Sermon Outline...page 3  MY VOICE, AND I KNOW THEM, AND THEY FOLLOW ME; AND I GIVE UNTO THEM  ETERNAL LIFE; AND THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH, NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN  PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND. MY FATHER, WHICH GAVE THEM ME, IS GREATER THAN ALL; AND NO MAN IS ABLE TO PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY FATHERS HAND. I AND MY FATHER ARE ONE." JN. 10:11-15 & 26-30]). ­ by his knowledge shall my righteous  servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities." Isaiah 53:10-11.  Now let us briefly recapitulate from Isa. 53:10-12. The subject is The Extent of the Atonement, or, the Limited Atonement; from which we get the "L" for the middle letter for the Calvinistic acronym, "TULIP." The question to be answered is, Just exactly for whom did Christ die? If you say, Christ died for every individual of mankind from Adam to the last man created just before the end of the world, I will tell you that you are a willingly ignorant son of Belial that I really am not interested in talking to for more than 5 minutes, lest I be drowned in "mischievous madness." (Eccl. 10:13) It is the charge of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ to earnestly contend for the faith (Jude v.3). The word contend here means to strive with opposition, to compete against, to defend or support, to maintain a position with convincing truth. By the authoritative words of the Almighty God. The question to be answered here is, "For whom did Christ make satisfaction?" Or, expressed in another way: "For whose sins did Christ make full atonement?" The Holy Ghost, writing through Isaiah, took great pains, ­ in at least 3 places ­ in Isa. 53:10, 11, & 12 ­ to make it clear as crystal, loud and clear, for all the world in all generations of the sons of men, on planet earth, THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR SOME ­ BUT NOT ALL; AND HE DIED FOR MANY ­ NOT ALL. There can be no doubt that the time and place is specified as being when the dear Lord Jesus hung in agony on the Cross just before He gave up the ghost, ­ through a redundancy of descriptions; to wit: It was when it pleased the Father to bruise Him; it was when it pleased the Father to put Him to grief; It was when the Father made His soul an offering for sin; It was when the pleasure of the Lord prospered in His hand; It was when He saw the travail of His soul, and was satisfied; It was when the Fathers righteous Servant, through His knowledge, JUSTIFIED MANY, BUT NOT ALL, by bearing their iniquities; It was when He poured out His soul unto death and was numbered with the transgressors; It was when He "BEAR THE SIN OF MANY," BUT NOT ALL; and, It was when He made intercession for the transgressors. See, Isa. 53:10-12. That, Beloved, is the Extent of the Atonement, aka, the Limited Design in the Atonement; aka, the Limited Atonement, whence we Calvinists get the "L" for the middle letter of the acronym, TULIP, that identifies us as TULIP BAPTISTS.  Which leads me to a brief discussion of another nick-name given Baptists, in the old days, in the South; to wit: HARDSHELL BAPTISTS, which was a backhanded tribute to their hardheaded, stubborn adherence to the doctrines of grace; to wit: Total depravity; Unconditional election; Limited atonement; Irresistible grace; and, Perseverance of the Saints.  Those old Baptists did not have much formal education, but their knowledge of the Bible would put most preachers today to shame. They were especially adept ­ in their own "ignorant" way ­ at defending the doctrines of grace. I ran into several in my day ­ and learned more from those few encounters than from many Bible classes at Bob Jones University and Prairie Bible Institute.  One such encounter was with a hard-working, middle-age gentleman in the panhandle of Texas, whom I met when we worked together briefly lifting and moving heavy loads in a huge wholesale grocery establishment in Plainview, Texas, home of Wayland, College, a Southern Baptist school steeped in Arminian theology.  Sunday, September 4, 2011  Sermon Outline...page 4  I was in town to check out Wayland, and the possibility of finishing my college career there. I do not recall my Texas co-worker's name. Just call him Tex. He was about 50 years old, strong and wiry, from a life of hard work and low, laborers wages. I liked him. We had two 15-minute breaks in a 10-hour work-day.  Tex, right away, wanted to talk about the Bible, in an inoffensive way. He said, something like this: "So, youre going to school to learn how to preach?" Yes. "They teach you the Bible?" Yes. "They teach you good English, sentence structure, things like that?" Er, Yes. "You know, ,,For by grace are ye saved through faith, and THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES; IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD; NOT OF WORKS, LEST ANY MAN SHOULD BOAST. (Eph. 2:8,9)?" Tex then went on to explain in what might certainly be called a scholars exposition of Eph. 2:8,9; to wit: (as best I can recall after some 64 years; although Ive thought about this incident so often during these recent years, I do believe the few salient points made herein are accurate); to wit: Yes, I said, it is one of my very favorite passages in all the Bible. "The main question is ­ and forever must be until answered honestly and right ­ WHAT DOES THE ,,THAT REFER TO?"  In these later years of my 81-year Pilgrimage, as I explore the paths of memory searching when it was that the Arminianism with which I was born gave completely away to the Calvinism with which I now rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory ­ I say, when was it that I saw the light, as they say? I do not say it was in the cavernous bowels of the wholesale grocery store that day long ago when I had a conversation with the humble gentleman, Tex. But I do say that Tex shot an arrow of divine truth in me that day that eventually bore Calvinistic fruit. I spent only a few days in Plainview, Texas, decided not to attend Wayland College, and left to attend Prairie Bible Institute in Three Hills, (near Calgary, Alberta), Canada, which was (and is) Arminian in theology. Nevertheless, the "THAT" of Eph. 2:8 remained unsettled in my mind and heart; to wit: "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and THAT not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; Not of works, lest any man should boast." (Eph. 2:8)  Beloved. I have given you this bit of my own biography, involving Tex and the "THAT" of Eph. 2:8, in the fond hope and genuine expectation that it may help you in your own struggles to make your own "calling and election sure" (2 Pet. 1:10). After all, it has pleased God that we should make this holy Pilgrimage to Heaven together, in part; and that I should be a little ahead of you, to help you, on the journey.  I believe we are all born Arminians, and except for the mighty interventions of a sovereign God, we would live out our lives on earth as hostile Arminians, and then die, and go to Hell, still screaming at God for creating us to be Arminians, saying: "WHY HAST THOU MADE ME THUS?" (Rom. 9:20) "And they gnawed their tongues for pain, And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds." (Rev. 16:10,11) Beloved, the "THAT" of Eph. 2:8 is "FAITH" ­ meaning the supernatural faith of Gods Elect, miraculously implanted in their hearts enabling them to savingly believe, and is the sine qua non (without which nothing) of all other saving virtues; e.g., to wit: "And in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition (that they are going to Hell), but to you of salvation (that you are going to Heaven), and that of God. For unto you IT IS GIVEN in the behalf of Christ, NOT ONLY TO BELIEVE ON HIM, but also to suffer for his sake. Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me." (Phil. 1:28-30) I love you. Amen.
