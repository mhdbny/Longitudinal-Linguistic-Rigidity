One Nanasaheb Dengle, who was a propertied man near Shirdi and who felt very much concerned about his childless state, approached Hazrat Sai Baba for his blessings. Sai Baba gave his bles­sings and the birth of a son in time solved the problem of inheritance for the above gentleman.This news soon spread apace, and Sai Baba began to be pestered by worldly people for worldly objects.

A bangle merchant, by name 
D.S. Rasne, a great devotee of Sai Baba, came to see him from Poona in the year 1895. He, too, had no issue, and was anxious to have his name continue. To enhance his perplexity, his horoscope and the science of astrology denied him any relief in that respect. Mr. Rasne, however, had great faith in Baba, who blessed him for an issue in a manner quite unique. 
Sai Baba one day happened to distribute mangoes brought by a devotee to the people gathered around him. While distributing mangoes he reserved eight of them, expressly ordering that they were meant for D. S. Rasne. A short time after this Rasne arrived, but unluckily for him four of the mangoes reserved by Sai Baba were somehow stolen by children. Sai Baba, however, gave him the remaining four mangoes ordering him not to eat them himself but to give them to his junior wife. He also incidentally remarked that he would have eight children, the first one would be a son whose name should be Daulatshah, the second also would be a son whose name should be Nanashah. Mr. Rasne was quite taken aback by the Seer's dive into futurity; yet every word of the Sage spoken in this respect came true. The wife of Mr. Rasne ate the fruits as instructed, and in course of time she begot altogether eight children, out of which only four survived, thus fulfilling the prophecy of Sai Baba in a very weird manner. 

... 

One Mr. Sapatnekar, a lawyer from Akkalkot, in his student life used to treat Sai Baba's name with contempt and derision. Later in life while he was established in his profession as a lawyer, he lost his only son, and this event broke him down completely. He remembered his contemptuous attitude towards Sai Baba, and went to him to obtain his pardon. In his first visit to Shirdi he had a very cold reception, but a year afterwards his wife saw Sai Baba in her dream, and was invited to Shirdi with her husband. In this visit Sai Baba gave a demonstration of his knowledge of all timespast, present and futureby relating many incidents of the lawyer's life. Thereafter Sai Baba blessed him, and said he would bring the identical soul of the departed child back into existence; and true enough, within a year of this prophecy, a son was born to the couple. 
... 

Looking at a child at Shirdi one day, Sai Baba remarked, I have to guard this child even while asleep." Some days later this child was walking through a water-logged lane in that village. On one side there was a five feet deep trench dug up for the foundation of a house. As it was full of water, it was indis­tinguishable from the surrounding land, and this child unwittingly walked into it. Since there was nobody nearby, the child ought to have been drowned in the ordinary course, but somehow it managed to scramble out. When questioned as to how he succeeded in getting out of the ditch, the child said that Sai Baba was there to show him the steps by which he climbed up. 
... 

One girl, Shanti Karandikar, who was three years old, one day happened to slip down a draw well. On hearing this mishap, people rushed to her rescue, but to their surprise they found her perfectly safe, neither, as they expected, drowned nor even hurt. When questioned as to her experience in the water, she said, in all simplicity befitting her age, that it was Sai Baba who was 

holding her all the while as she fell in the water. 
... 

Mr. H. S. Dixit, B. A., LL. B., (Ex. 
M. L. C.), who, having renounced the world, was leading a spiritual life in the atmosphere of Sai Baba at Shirdi. One day Sai Baba remarked to him, "Why do you worry? Your responsibility is mine." Kaka Dixit, as he was called by the people there, could not understand the relevancy of this remark. A few days later he went to Bombay to see his wife and children, and he was told that that very day his younger daughter aged about six had met with an accident. A heavy almirah near which the child was playing accidentally fell upon her, but the wonder was, she was not hurt very seriously. This incident brought home to Mr. Dixit the significance of Baba's remarks. 
... 

Sai Baba indulged in very queer methods while averting the mishaps coming in the way of his admirers and devotees. Besides blessing them with udi (ashes), flowers or any other material thing as the medium for his healing, he would very often draw the diseases on to himself from the body of the sick person. The late Diwan Bahadur G. S. Khaparde, with his wife and two sons, was staying at Shirdi in the year 1911 and 1912. An epidemic of plague was raging in the district, and one of his sons happened to contact the disease. Mrs. G. S. Khaparde was horrified and wanted to leave immediately with the infected son for better medical treatment at Bombay. Sai Baba addressed her in a very figurative language, saying that the danger would pass off; but this did not pacify the lady. Baba thereupon showed her the huge buboes on his own body, and said, "Mother, I have to suffer this for the sake of your son." In due course Baba having drawn the disease on to himself, the son got cured, and Baba also after some time recovered his health. 
... 

A similar favour was extended by Sai Baba to Mrs. Manager of that place. When that lady had aching eyes with profuse lachry­mation, Baba simply looked at her. This made her eyes cease watering, and instead Sai Babas eyes began dripping tears profusely. 

... 

Once a fanatic Rohila who had great respect for Sai Baba and who even called him Paigamber, i.e., the Messenger of God, lost his equanimity of mind on seeing the Hindu idolatory and image worship tolerated by the Saint in his surroundings. He took upon himself to end all this heathenic atmosphere, and came up armed with a big club to slay Sai Baba whom he considered the promoter of all these irreligious activities. When he approached Baba with homicidal intent, the latter merely cast a glance at him and touched his wrist. This immediately paralysed the Rohila who sank to the ground like a punctured baloon. 
... 

Mr. H. B. Nachne, working as a head clerk in the Taluka Shiraste­dar's office at Kurla, was a great devotee of Sai Baba. When he visited him in 1913, Sai Baba remarked to him nonchalantly, One should not trust mad men. This remark had no significance to Mr. Nachne, and he could not under­stand it. Some­
time afterwards, when he was attending to the worship of the household gods and Baba's photo, he saw a crazy person standing at some distance. He was deemed to be quite harmless, and Mr. Nachne went on with his worship quite un­concerned. All of a sudden the said mad man pounced upon Mr. Nachne, and wanted to strangle him to death. Mr. Nachne grappled with the man as best as he could, and afterwards lost consciousness. The other in­mates of the house rushed to his help, and saved him from the death grip of the mad man in time. 
When Mr. Nachne happened to visit Sai Baba after this incident, Baba divulged to him the part he played in the above episode, by incidentally remarking to one Anna standing nearby, "Had I hesitated a minute more, the mad man would have throttled him to death. If I don't look after my children, who else will see to it? 
... 

Nanasaheb's daughter, Matusari Minatai, aged 17, was suffering labour pains. The sufferings were so very severe and prolonged that she could no longer tolerate them. Further­more there was no medical help available nearby. The father of the girl relied on the prophetic words of Sai Baba, "Wherever you are and whatever you do, I am always with you," and hoped that by Sai Babas grace the crisis would be tided over. 

Sai Baba, knowing of the predicament in which the daughter of his devotee was involved, gave some udi (ashes) to a gosavi (an ascetic) at Shirdi, and instructed him to give it to Nanasaheb for the use of his daughter. The gosavi had only two rupees with him, and it was not sufficient to provide the railway fare for a thirty miles journey to Jamner by rail and road. But Baba laconically replied to him not to worry. The gosavi left for the destination, and at Jalgaon he was surprised to find a tonga waiting for him, and he was informed that in anticipation of his arrival the tonga was arranged by Nanasaheb. Within five minutes of the administration of the udi the girl successfully got through the ordeal. When Nana­saheb learnt about the tonga and the peon provided at the railway station, he denied all knowledge of it. This is another instance of saints smoothing out all difficulties in the way of devotees when they feel concerned about them. 
... 

A party of Bombay devotees had visited Shirdi for the celebration of Ramnavami Utsav and they were returning to Bombay. When their train reached Thana, which is about thirty miles from Bombay, one of the ladies among the party got down on the platform to get a little water. While trying to re-enter the carriage, her foot slipped and the train began to move. She fell in between the railway platform and the foot-boards of the train, and everyone thought that she must have been run over by the moving train. When the train stopped, people ran up to see the lady's mangled corpse, but to the surprise of everyone, she stood up, not in the least worse for the mishap. When questioned she explained that no sooner she fell, she thought of Sai Baba who was instantaneously there and kept her pressed against the sidewall of the platform till the train came to a stop. None, 

however, except the lady saw Sai Baba there. 
... 

One Mr. Cholkar, in order to better his prospects, wanted to pass an examination; but the examination was too stiff a job for him to tackle. He invoked mentally Sai Baba's help and promised to undertake a pilgrimage to Shirdi if he passed. He succeeded in his examination, but was still too poor to arrange a railway fare for the journey to Sai Baba. He began saving something by stinting even a little sugar for his tea. When at last he went to Sai Baba, no sooner the latter saw him, Baba ordered the host to give Cholkar tea with plenty of sugar, thereby demonstrating his know­ledge of the devotee's mind and finance. 
... 

Dr. Tendulkar, when a medical student, was extremely diffident of success in the examination. He began consulting soothsayers and astrologers, and they all confirmed his fears in that respect. He became utterly hopeless. Sai Baba, when informed, guaranteed him success, and asked him to forget all astrology and prophecies of others. He 
enjoined upon him to boldly face the examination. To the surprise of himself and his friends Dr. Ten­dulkar passed the examination. 
... 

Mr. G. G. Shiriyan, a devotee of Baba, was imposed a a disciplinary fine on very flimsy grounds by his superior officer. That night he prayed to Baba who answered in his dream promising remedy in that respect. The next day when he attended office, he found to his surprise that the officer concerned had revised his decision and withdrew the fine imposed without any appeal being made to him on that account. Mr. G. G. Shiriyan was exonerated of the blame, and it was thrust on to the head of an innocent boy. On the advice of Mr. Shiriyan, the boy prayed to Sai Baba who promised relief to him in seventy-three days' time. Thereafter the boy decided not to appeal or apply for clemency. On the seventieth day the boy's immediate superior took it upon himself to represent his case, and exactly on the seventy-third day the fine imposed upon him stood cancelled. 
... 


A servant of Sai Baba and five others were sentenced to imprison­ment by a Taluka Magistrate. The judgment of the Magistrate was based on the direct evidence of half a dozen eye-witnesses. When the papers of the judgment were shown to eminent lawyers and magistrates, one and all gave their decision that there was no case for appeal. Ulti­mately when the matter came to Sai Babas notice, he ordered the friends of the accused to approach one Mr. S. B. Dhumal, a pleader of Nasik. He. too, on going through the papers, hesitated to handle the case. But, on being informed that it was Sai Babas wish, he agreed to represent the case. He lodged an appeal in the court of the District Magistrate, Ahmednagar, who told him that the case was very strong against the appellant, as it was based on direct evidence of eye­witnesses. Mr. Dhumal retorted by saying, "The number of witnesses is no criterion to judge a case and particularly a case coming from a village like Shirdi which is ridden by factions and parties." The Magistrate asked, "Do you really think so?" To which a ready 
response was given by the pleader, "I do not think, I know." Thereupon the Magistrate wrote out an appellate judgment without giving notice to the complainant, the police or the public prosecutor, and acquitted all the accused. 
At Shirdi Sai Baba gave the people assembled there to under­stand that they would very shortly witness a chamatkar (miracle). Shortly afterwards Mr. S. B. Dhumal arrived and gave the astounding news of the wholesale acquittal of the convicted persons. and then the people realised that it was this chamatkar that Sai Baba referred to some time back. 
... 

Dr. Chidambaram Pillai, a very devoted bhakta (devotee) of Baba, had guinea worm. When his condition became worse and intolerable, he said to Baba that, instead of wiping out his sanskaras through pain and sufferings in this life only, he would prefer that his sufferings might be spread over ten succeeding lives. Sai Baba rebuked him for his weakness, and told him that Saints can finish the sufferings of ten lives in ten days. 

When the Doctor came to him, Sai Baba asked him to lie down in the mosque, and informed him that a crow, after pecking at his wound, would put an end to all his troubles. A little later a faithful servant of Baba, by name Abdul, whom he fondly styled as his "crow", while trying to clean the Masjid lamps, accidentally put his foot on the swollen leg of Dr. Pillai who writhed in agony at this operation. But this accident had a remarkable effect on the wound. All the accu­mulated pus and the worm strings were forced out completely, and in a very few days thereafter Dr. Pillai was restored to complete health. 
... 

One Vithalrao Yeshwant Desh­pandes grandfather had lost the sight of both his eyes for the last twenty years. He had great faith in Sai Baba and went to Shirdi. He was led into the mosque where Sai Baba was seated at the time, and after going to Baba he said, "I am totally blind. I cannot see. 
Sai Baba at once replied, "You will see immediately." Thus saying he placed his hands on the old man's head, and the sight was 
immediately restored to him. This is an instance of Sai Baba's healing by a mere touch of his hands. 
... 

Once K. G. Buti, a rich landlord of Nagpur and a great devotee of Baba, was infected with cholera during his stay at Shirdi. As one of the symptoms of this foul disease, Buti was suffering from intense thirst which could not be allayed by any amount of water given to him. Dr. Pillai who was in charge of the case consulted Sai Baba as to the drink that would quench his thirst. Sai Baba prescribed an infusion of almonds and other ingredients boiled in sugared milk. This would be the last thing a patient suffering from cholera would be prescribed by any medical man practising the medical sciences of either the East or the West. Such a decoction would be considered fatal to the case. But in this case the Doctor laid aside his own knowledge of medicine, and literally obeyed Sai Baba's instructions. The infusion as given by Baba was prepared and administered to the patient. The cholera, to the surprise of every­one, was 

aborted, and the patient completely recovered. 
... 

One Bhimaji, suffering from a chronic chest disease supposed to be tuberculosis, was brought before Sai Baba for a cure. Baba explained that the disease was the result of his past misdeedsthat of theftand he must repay the debt incurred by suffering physically. At first Sai Baba refused to interfere, but when the people around him pleaded persistently on his behalf and put forth the plea that the patient was his refugee now and as such he could not be deprived of his grace and mercy, he (Sai Baba) relented and said, "Don't worry. Your troubles are over. The Faqir is all merciful. He will eradicate your disease. He loves all as his own Self." 
Thereupon Baba adopted a very strange method of bringing about his cure through giving him strange experiences in his dreams. In his first dream the patient saw himself in his boyish years and suffered the severe pain of being caned by his teacher for not learning his lessons. In the next dream he underwent the experience of intense torture and fright caused by a stone roller being rolled up and down over his chest. The pain and perturbation thus suffered in the dream state enabled him to repay his karmic debt which automatically resulted in curing his diseased state of health. 
... 

Sometimes Masters like Sai Baba give orders to their devotees which to the person concerned seem very awkward and meaningless. But bitter experience teaches them that even random words and behests of a Master have a deep significance which, if ignored, the party concerned has to pay very dearly for not listening to them. The following are a few instances of Sai Baba's prescience which a layman would term as idiosyncracies which saved many a devotee the inconveniences of the situation. 
Once Nanasaheb had to meet his Collector and other officers at a camp, and prayed for leave. Sai Baba refused to grant it. The next day Baba allowed him to go, and when Nana went to the Collector's camp, he was informed that the meeting had been postponed by the Collector himself. 

A pleader had to conduct a very important case at Pandharpur, and requested Baba's leave to depart. Sai Baba refused leave, but the next day he allowed him to go. The lawyer who had obeyed Baba, on reaching Pandharpur, was very much relieved to find that the case which he was to conduct had been postponed for one day during his absence on the application of the opposite party. 
A District Munsiff summoned one Tatya Patel to appear before him in his court. Sai Baba asked him not to go, at which Tatya Patel improvised an excuse for his inability to attend the court that day. The next day he was surprised to learn that the court did not function on account of the Munsiff's indisposition. 
One Mr. H. V. Sathe had a very important engagement with the Collector of the district and the superior officers, and wanted to leave immediately. Sai Baba interfered and forbade him to go. Mr. Sathe was greatly perturbed by this order, as absence in this case involved the risk of dismissal or other serious consequences. Sai Baba, finding him in this disturbed frame of mind, asked his father-in­law to lock him up for two days, as he was fretting too much over the consequences of his absence. Mr. Sathe, going to the camp on the third day, was overjoyed to find that all the original arrangements had been cancelled by the superior officers without sufficient infor­mation to him. This incident greatly enhanced Mr. Sathe's faith in Sai Baba being a Trikal-gnyani, i.e., a Knower of things past, present and future. 
... 

One G. D. Vaidya, a devotee of Baba, in spite of his great exertions in the matter, failed to arrange a suitable match for his grown-up daughter. Brooding over this question, one day he retired to bed, and Sai Baba appeared in his dream. The latter showed him two boys, and said, "I have knowledge of your worries, and one of these boys, 'Keshav Dixit's son', would be the match for your daughter." Mr. Vaidya's son, when informed about this dream, said that one of the boys seen in the dream was working in his office and fitted in completely on all points noticed in the dream. After making due inquiries, the boy of the dream was located, and after a little preliminaries the marriage of his daughter became a realized fact. 

... 

Mr. G. G. Shiriyan had entered into an agreement with a friend in 1924 that their children should marry each other. His friend who had a son, in order to secure a better prospect and dowry, went back on his word, and refused to fulfil the marriage contract. Mr. Shiriyan was greatly pained over this situation, and appealed to Sai Baba for help and advice. Sai Baba appeared in his dream, and promised to secure for him the identical boy as his son-in-law in the course of two years. 
In the meanwhile, his friend's plans and hopes for obtaining a high price for his son in the marital market ended in smoke, and the subject of this bargain, the son himself, also proved recal­citrant on grounds of conscience and high mindedness. Eventually the old pact between the two families was restored, and the marriage of the young couple came to be celebrated, true to the words of Sai Baba, within two years. 
These are some of the incidents or miraculous happenings in the lives of Sai Baba's admirers and devotees, and if anything, they show unmistakably how he reacted spiritually towards those who reposed implicit faith in his divine personality. Sai Baba's greatest duty* on the earthly plane may be said to be the Great War of 1914, and his greatest miracle or achievement was to make Shri Upasni Maharaj spiritually Perfect
