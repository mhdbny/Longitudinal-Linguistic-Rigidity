THE SAYING OF SHRI MEHER BABA 

God 

    There is nothing but God. 



Only three things are of Real Worth: God, Love, and the Perfect Master. These three are almost one and the same. 

    It is the same One Paramatman or Supreme Soul who is playing the different parts of the Almighty, the Creator (Ishwar), Shivatman, and Jivatman. 

The Almighty, the Supreme Soul, God, is beyond even the super-conscious state. He is infinite; He is the shoreless ocean of Truth. As Ishwar, He is the creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe. 

    The individual or ordinary consciousness that has not realized God is finite and limited. 

The Shivatman or God-realized man knows himself as the Almighty, the One Infinite Ocean of Truth. He has attained the Christ-conscious state. Shivatman is the Sadguru or Perfect Master. He knows that He is in every man (Jivatman) and that every Jivatman is in Him. The Perfect Master is Love, Lover and the Beloved.
