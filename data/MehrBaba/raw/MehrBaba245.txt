FREEDOM 



"We have gained our National freedom, Let us now try to gain our Spiritual Freedom, beside which every other kind of freedom is a binding. Spiritual Freedom is marred by the bindings of lust, power, greed, anger, hatred, jealousy and low desires. When the prison of these bindings is torn asunder, the heritage of freedom which is born of Infinite Power, Wisdom, Peace, Love and Bliss, is gained. To attain this Freedom, we must realize God who is the source of freedom. To realize God we must love Him, losing ourselves in His Infinite Self. We can love God through intense longing for Union with Him. We can love God by surrendering to the Sadguru who is God's personal Manifestation. We can also love God by loving our fellow men, by giving them happiness at the cost of our own happiness, by rendering them service at the sacrifice of our interests and by dedicating our lives at the altar of selfless work for the down-trodden. When we love God intensely through any of these channels we finally know Him to be our own Self. 

The purpose of life is to realize God within ourselves. This can be done even whilst attending to our worldly duties. In the everyday walks of life and amidst intense activities, we should feel detached and dedicate our doings to our Beloved God. 

Enough has been done to make people food-minded. They must now be made God-minded. The down-trodden and the poor must be made to understand that from the spiritual point of view, their misfortunes and miseries could be made weapons for the struggle for Truth. They should feel that these miseries can be counted as gifts from God and, if faced bravely and cheerfully, can become the gateway to eternal happiness. 

I giye my love and blessings to one and all for the understanding of the One Infinite God residing equally within us all and beside whom everything else is false and illusory."
