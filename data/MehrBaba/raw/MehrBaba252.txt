My dear Dr. H. L. Kenmore, 
Jai Baba! Thanks for your very, very good article about Baba-Iovers which appeared in your precious Baba journal, volume 1, number 5, issued on the 25th of May 1970. 
Dear Dr. Kenmore really it touches my heart. It is a sublime article useful for all-everywhere in the world. I appreciate this article along with your other talks and articles. Really your are blessed, and God, Meher Baba, has kindly gifted you with such profound knowledge and understanding. 
Dear Harry, this Baba journal of the Society for Avatar Meher Baba called The Way and the Goal, under your care, is like a torch that shines in the darkness, guiding and leading shining just like the sun on all the hearts of the seekers of the Truth in the East as well as in the West. May Avatar Meher Baba make it lasting for many, many years. Amen. Now dear Dr. Kenmore, 
If possible please send one copy of each issue for me in care of Eruch at Meherazad. I want to translate and send it to Iran for the benefit of Baba≠seekers there. May Avatar Meher Baba help you in many ways in your work for Him. My Jai Baba to your Annarosa and those who help you in Baba≠work there. 
Yours Lovingly, ALOBA
