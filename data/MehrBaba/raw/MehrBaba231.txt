Divine secrets are more arrestive and effective when clothed in parables. 
It is historically related that Sultan kingdom incognito to acquaint himself Mahmud of Ghazni (Afghanistan) was first hand with the state of affairs and in the habit of going out into his people. One night seeing four 
people moving about in a suspicious manner, he accosted them as to who they were. The reply was that they were thieves by profession and were out on business. 
Sultan Mahmud immediately took in the situation, and assured them that himself having come out with similar intentions, he would like to join them for the night's venture. Agreeing with the proposition and feeling more confidence which very often number inspires, they proposed a daring attempt at thieving in the palace of the Sultan himself. The King readily fell in with the idea, but wanted to ascertain each one's qualification for that risky job. Thereupon the first thief replied: "I can understand the language of animals;" the second one said: "I have very keen olfactory nerves; I can smell the location of any buried treasure;" the third thief explained: "I can open the best or the worst of locks without the help of a key;" and the fourth one affirmed: "If I see a person even once in the darkest of nights, I can recognize him in a million." 
It was now for the King to state his own qualification, and so he said: "I have the power to bring about the release of a man about to be hanged, by merely nodding my head." On this the thieves became highly overjoyed and confessed say­ing, ''Brother, your power is an exceptional one. Now that you are with us, we are afraid of nothing. We can do and dare anything we like. Hurrah, let's go." 
All the five headed towards the objective for the night, i.e., the palace of the Sultan. On the way hearing a dog bark, the King asked the one who knew the language of animals as to what the dog was saying. The thief replied, "The dog is telling that one of us is a king but refuses to say any further." On entering the palace precincts, the specialist amongst them pointed out the location of the treasure, and another one succeeded in opening the lock thereon without the help of a key. Having helped themselves to a large booty, the thieves left for their destination. The King also parted company, having very astutely ascer­tained the names and addresses of his confederates.
