One night, while strolling about in the town, Baba Tajuddin entered the house of a goldweaver without announcing himself. The inmates of the house were surprised at the coming in of a stranger so very unceremoniously. When confronted with a male member of the household, Baba asked him to vacate the house immediately with whatever valuable articles he could remove. The goldweaver hesitated for a moment, but being impressed by the saintly personality of the intruder and the peremptory tone of his order, he complied with the hint given him. Soon afterwards the house somehow caught fire, and compliance with the order of the Saint resulted in the family and the valuables being saved. This miracle took place at Kamptee prior to Baba Tajuddin being lodged in the lunatic asylum. 
... 

Once Baba Tajuddin was walking along near the tomb of Hazrat  Syed Saheb at Kamtee. He happened to see a worried and distracted Marwadi going towards the court of law. Baba Tajuddin laughed aloud, and said that the suit pending in the court against him was dismissed. The preoccupied Marwadi found it difficult to believe his words. On going to the court he was surprised to find the suit against him dismissed, and was thus greatly impressed by the pre-science of Baba Tajuddin in the matter. As a token of his faith in him, the Marwadi brought some sweets which Baba Tajuddin ordered to be distributed amongst children. 
... 

Once Baba Tajuddin called at a house in the city, and begged for some food to eat. The inmate replied that they had already taken their meals and there was nothing left in the house. The man was taken aback when Baba told him that he was telling a lie, and the food was there concealed in the box. The man went inside and was surprised to find the food in the box mentioned. He brought it out and gave it to Baba Tajuddin. 

... 

While in the lunatic asylum one day Dr. Abdul Majid, the Medical Officer in charge of the Institution, expressed to Baba Tajuddin his desire to go to Bombay. Baba Tajuddin refused him permission, saying the road was dangerous. As the doctor had a pressing en­gagement in Bombay, he requested persistently to be allowed to go. Whereupon Baba Tajuddin very reluctantly granted him the permission and at the same time gave him a leaf from a tree nearby, with instructions to preserve it carefully. 
The doctor went to Bombay, and as something untoward was exepected from the hesitancy with which the permission was granted to him, he met with an accident. The doctor, after alighting from the train, wanted to take a short cut to the platform by crossing the railway lines instead of the overbridge. While crossing the lines, all of a sudden, he saw a light engine coming towards him at great speed. 
He became greatly nervous, and in the excitement of the moment he tripped and fell across the railway track. To the astonishment of the doctor and the spectators around, the engine, although travelling at a good speed, came to a sudden halt just a few inches from his body. The railway officials congratulated the doctor at his miraculous escape from the accident, whereupon the doctor related to the officials how Baba Tajuddin was unwilling to give him permission to visit Bom­bay. The railway officials clearly saw in the incident the spiritual interference of Baba Tajuddin, and they all accompanied the doctor shortly afterwards for the Saint's darshan in the lunatic asylum. 
... 

One day a man came to Baba Tajuddin, and informed him that his daughter was on the point of death and the best of medical treatment failed to see any improvement in her condition. After this the man began to shed tears and wailingly beseached Babas grace for her. Baba Tajuddin closed his eyes, and after a few moments smiled and said, "Your daughter is all right. The man 

immediately returned home in a very hopeful mood, and was wonder-struck to find the girl sitting in her bed partaking of food. 
The man inquired of the inmates of the house as to how she happened to come round so quickly. They informed him that a few minutes ago a mendicant came to the door and asked for alms. When it was given him, he made personal inquiries and was told about the girl's sickness. He came into the house and saw the girl. This mendicant stood for a few seconds by the sick bed and departing said, "Don't worry, she will be all right." Soon after the mendicant left, the girl came to her senses and demanded food. The father who had seen Baba Tajuddin a little while ago said that the mendicant 
was none himself.  else  but  the  Saint  
.  .  .  
Once a Katchi MeBombay, whose father seriously ill, came to  mon was see  from lying Baba  

Tajuddin at Nagpur. He related his father's hopeless and helpless plight, and begged for his intercession. On hearing this tale Baba Tajuddin indulged in a hearty laugh, and said that his father was already good in health in Bombay. On hearing this the Katchi gentleman immediately wired to Bombay and got the news that his father was out of danger, thus verifying the miraculous truth in the words of the Saint. 
... 

Once a man, by name Babu Ramsing, was involved in a criminal charge against him. He approached Baba Tajuddin and pleaded his case, whereupon Baba Tajuddin assured him that he would be absolved of the criminal charge. On the date of the hearing the man appeared in the court in person, as he was too poor to engage a pleader to conduct his case. To his surprise he saw altogether a stranger in the person of a barrister presenting himself before the court, and requesting permission to argue the case for the defendent. The proceedings began, and on a technical point of law he won the case. Ramsing was let off and he approached the barrister to thank him as well as to ascertain as to what made him plead on his behalf unsolicited. The barrister replied that he should 

not be bothered with any further questions in the matter. He was there because the Saint who interested himself in his case ordered him to do so. Giving this astounding piece of information, the barrister departed. 
... 

There was a police head con­stable who used to visit Baba Tajuddin now and then even while on active duty. His immediate officer reprimanded him and threatened to report him if he persisted in this habit, saying, "If I once make a report against you, I would like to see how your Baba Tajuddin can help you out of it." The constable replied, You can do your worst, and continued his habit of having Baba Tajuddin's darshan: After this incident no sooner Baba Tajuddin saw him, he said, "Certainly Tajuddin will save you; don't worry, you will be promoted." Baba Tajuddin's words came true. The officer was soon afterwards transferred, and the said constable found himself promoted to his place. 
... 

A pious Mahomedan from India 
had gone to Mecca for the performance of the Haj ceremony. On the mountain nearby called Arafat he saw a saintly personality coming towards him. He paid obeisance to him and asked the Saint's name and address. The Saint replied that his name was Tajuddin, and that he lived in the mad jhopdi (hut), meaning thereby the lunatic asylum at Nagpur. Saying this he went away and was never to be seen again. When the Haji returned to India from Mecca, he came to Nagpur and visited the lunatic asylum. Right enough there in the asylum he saw the same personality whom he saw at the Mount of Arafat, and to his astonishment the Haji was informed that Baba Tajuddin was talking about him just an hour before. Both the Saint and the Haji met each other very cordially, and the latter, in the course of his talk, evinced a desire to see some miracle about him. No sooner this thought flashed across his mind, Baba Tajuddin put his thumb and the fore-finger on to the eyes of the visitor, and asked him, "What do you see now? Is this not Arafat where we 

had met at the time of the Haj cermony?" The Haji was immedi­ately convinced of Baba Tajuddin's high state of spirituality and requested him to show him the sight of God. The Saint artfully replied, "O dear me, who can travel that far? 
... 

One Mr. Murtaza of Nagpur relates having seen Baba Tajuddin eating pulav (a favourite dish of the Mahomedans in the East) and that too very voraciously. He wondered that saints never enjoy luxuries and neither they eat full stomach. Why Baba happened to do like this today? No sooner this thought passed in his mind, Baba Tajuddin stopped eating and began eating pieces of stones lying nearby. He was eating the stones with as much relish as children would eat sweets. Mr. Murtaza felt sorry for the questioning attitude of his mind, and begged of the Saint to forgive this weakness and doubt on his part. 
... 

One day Baba Tajuddin, all of a sudden, turned to a man standing nearby, and said, "What are you doing here? Your wife is dead." The man immediately returned home and was given a telegram in­forming him of his wife's death. 
... 

One day people came to Baba Tajuddin requesting him to pray for rains. The Saint immediately held a piece of brick in between his teeth and looked up at the sky. Within a short time clouds gathered and it 
rained  heavily, flooding the  
countryside.   
.  .  .  

One day a very righteous but well-to-do man of the place, by name Narayanrao, happened to meet Baba Tajuddin in seclusion. He was overawed to see the Saint with a big snake round his neck. He was very much frightened and ran straight to Dr. Abdul Majid and informed the latter as to what he saw. Both of them returned and saw the same sight of the vicious cobra coiled round the Saint's neck. They were afraid to go nearer to him. Seeing this Baba Tajuddin removed the snake, and smilingly asked them to approach him. 
... 

While in the lunatic asylum a woman was brought to Baba Tajuddin, and it was reported about her that she was suffering great agonies as a result of being obsessed by a genii (a spirit of a high order). Many remedies, religious and mundane, were applied in her case, but to no avail. No sooner the woman was brought to Baba Tajuddin"s presence, he spat in her face, saying, "Why are you so bold and insolent with the faqirs?" The moment he uttered these words, the woman fell down unconscious. When coming to her senses there was a glow of happiness and relief on her facethe ghost had escaped. 

... 

A married woman of affluent circumstances had been to Ajmer for beseeching the Khwaja Saheb to relieve her of her chronic ailment. There she had a dream in which she was directed to go to Nagpur, as the good that she sought was in the hand of Baba Tajuddin. The woman accordingly left for Nagpur. On arriving at the Saint's place she was informed that Baba Tajuddin was not there, as he had gone towards the jungle a short while ago. She was very eager to see him and could not wait for the 
Saint's return. She started im­mediately towards the jungle. When she had not proceeded far, she saw Baba Tajuddin returning with very quick strides in her direction. At that moment Baba Tajuddin was, in the language of the Sufis, in a state of jalal (divine glory). No sooner their eyes met, she felt as if the sun was paling and it looked like the dusk of evening pervading all around. She felt a sort of a weird stillness in the atmosphere, and it looked as if all the animate life round about i.e. animals, birds, vegetation ceased to function and move. When the Saint approached her, he began throwing big pieces of stones at her. The woman was extremely frightened and wanted to run away. Then Baba Tajuddin ran towards her and caught her by the shoulders, saying. "Mother, why are you afraid? I was not going to hurt you." At these words of the Saint she felt the whole atmosphere about her again pulsating with life and resuming normality, and to her great wonderment she began to feel even physically normal. The chronic complaint which had made her life miserable for such a length of time had vanished miraculously. 

... 

Once a Government servant, for some lapse on his part, was dismissed from service. In spite of many appeals he got no redress. He went to Ajmer in a very dejected frame of mind. One night he saw the Khawja of Ajmer in his dream surrounded by a few companions who all looked like saints. The Khawja, pointing towards him, said, "Go away, you will be reinstated." When this man returned to his place, he was surprised to find a letter from the authorities concerned informing him of his reinstatement. 
After a few days this very man happened to go to Nagpur and incidentally had Baba Tajuddin's darshan. No sooner he approached Baba Tajuddin, who accosted him, saying, "Well, you have come? Do you recognize me? I was there when the great Master told you about your resuming service." 
... 

A man was accused of the murder of a rich barber, and after a pro­tracted trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. The parents and relations of the murderer came to see Baba Tajuddin at Waki and related the story. The Saint for a long time did not countenance them at all, and used to fly into rage at the sight of any one of them. However, one day, being in the spiritual state of jamal (divine beatitude), Baba Tajuddin, on seeing the parents approaching him, uttered the words, "The murderer would be realeased." Right enough in the higher court of appeal the man was declared not guilty and was discharged. 
... 

Once a man was under the shadow of decree from a court of law for a very big amount, and his appeal was pending in the higher court. The man wrote to his guru (Master) at Allahabad and requested his grace in the success of the appeal. The reply came to him that the spiritual and material chargemanship of India at the moment was in the hands of Baba Tajuddin, and he was advised to go and lodge his appeal at Nagpur. The man accordingly came to Nagpur and got his desire fulfilled. 
... 


One spiritual personage, by name Zahurali Shah, relates as follows: One day I was going towards old Delhi to visit a saint's tomb. On the way, while sitting underneath a tree smoking hukka, I saw a man coming towards me. On seeing me the approaching figure halted. I at first saw nothing unusual about it, but after a while I could not but feel that I as in the presence of a great personality. This man came near to me and asked me to accompany him. I thereupon asked him, ''Where do you live and what's your town?" He replied, "I live at Nagpur Waki. Do come to me. 
After walking a distance the strange man left me, excusing himself for something and dis­appeared from my sight. I waited for a long time for him to return, but there were no signs of him. After some days on visiting Nagpur I found in Baba Tajuddin the identical personality in the very same garb and attire in which I met him at Delhi. 
... 

Once a Tahsildar, by name Munshi Mahomed Husain, ap­proached Baba Tajuddin and related to him plaintively that he had heard no news from his native place Hyderbad (Deccan) in spite of many letters to his relatives there. Baba Tajuddin said, "Where are your letters?" Thus saying he produced all the letters written by him from behind his pillow, and said, "All your letters are lying here." 
... 

Once a boy, by name Azizuddin, had gone -to the river along with Baba Tajuddin. The river was in floods at the time, and leaving company of the Saint, he went along with some boys to the banks of the river. Accidentally he lost his foot­hold and found himself struggling in the angry waters. He cried out for Baba Tajuddin to save him. Baba Tajuddin was partaking of his meal at the time, and nobody besides him heard the drowning boy's cry for help. He gave up eating and speedily ran in the direction of the river. During that time the boy had been carried away a long distance by the strong current. Baba Tajuddin standing by the side of the river, raised up both his hands high above the head and asked people to render help. Nobody 

from amongst the crowd dared to risk his life in the flooded river. With great persuasion two or three people ventured to enter the water, but they returned unsuccessful, as the boy had floated a long way down with the current. Thereupon Baba Tajuddin asked one faqir to go into the river, and being assured of Baba's help the latter took a dive. This faqir saw the floating boy as if he was being brought in his direction by somebody, and eventually saved him. Till the boy was safe out of the water, Baba Tajuddin was seen holding aloft both his hands above his bead, and the people assembled there saw the boy floating on the surface only, although he was not a swimmer at all. 
... 

Once a professional singer by name Surji, who was very often entertaining Baba Tajuddin with her music, fell ill. In spite of best treatment her condition daily grew from bad to worse. Ultimately she expired, and medically it was certified that life was extinct. On hearing this, Rangarao Baboo went to inform Baba Tajuddin that Surji was dead. Thereupon Baba Tajuddin flared up and said, ''You  are telling a lie. She is alive. In a short while she will get up. If she dies, who will entertain me with singing? She is only sleeping. Don't disturb her." These words were uttered by the Saint at 10 o'clock at night, and Surji came to life again at 3 a.m. the next morning. There was great jubil­ation all around, and the news of the woman being restored to life was the talk of the town for some days. 
... 

One day it was raining very heavily, and Baba Tajuddin was seen walking to and fro in the rains, followed by a. large crowd behind him. By chance Baba Tajuddin happened to see a dog lying dead for three days. The Saint approached the dog and touched the dead body with his hands, saying, "Why are you lying here? Get thee away." The dog immed­iately came to life and skulked away. It is said the dog is still alive.  
... 

One day Baba Tajuddin's auntie brought tea for him. He refused emphatically to drink it, saying, "Feed this tea to a fox lying dead in the field nearby." The auntie went there as directed, and accosted the fox to drink of the tea sent by Baba Tajuddin. The fox immediately came to life and licked up the tea sent by the Saint. 

... 

Once the nightingale of Delhi, Janakibai, the famous singer, came to Nagpur and wanted to entertain Baba Tajuddin with her sweet music. No sooner she was ushered into his presence, Baba Tajuddin lost his temper and said, "Take away the bitch from my sight. She thinks she can charm me like the worldly people by the sweetness of her voice and personnality." Thus saying he ordered his tonga to be got ready for him, as he wanted to go to the river side. It was raining heavily at the same time, and the country-side was all a bog of mud and mire. On reaching the river Baba Tajuddin alighted from his tonga, and walked towards the bank of the river wading through deep mud, and squatted down there as unconcerned  as one would sit on a sofa. Then he remembered the singer from Delhi, and ordered that she should be brought there to sing if she was at all willing. Janakibai was informed of the Saint's wish and she unhesitatingly complied. In spite of her costly attire she waded through the mud and sat down on the watery patch of the ground with all the paraphernalia of her profession and entertained the Saint for almost three hours with her sweet music. The people who witnessed the scene describe it that the atmosphere seemed to be charged with divine ecstacy for the time that she was singing. Thereafter Baba Tajuddin blessed her and sent her away. 
This eccentricity on the part of the Saint was with a view to bring down her ego as she, being a noted artist, thought she was honouring the Saint by offering to entertain him with her music. She was very coldly made to understand that it was the Saint who was honouring and blessing her by allowing her to sing in his presence.
