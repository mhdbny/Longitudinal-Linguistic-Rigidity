What is the spiritual significance of Mantra (Persian 'Zikr')? How is a neophyte helped by a monotonous incantation or repetition of a certain word or words? Ans. 

    Mantra is very beneficial to a neophyte on the spiritual path, particularly so when it is given by the Guru. The first and immediate result accruing from the oft repetition of word or words is the concentration of the mind on the subject to be gained. Secondly, the sound vibrations as a result of continuous repetition induces, in course of time, an harmonious sympathy to the sound vibrations of the higher planes engendering a blissful feeling√≥a factor greatly encouraging to a beginner. This blissful feeling, coupled with the awakening of mental powers, is called the Mantric force, and it has immense possibilities for good as well as bad.
