 July 28, 2008 With Friends Like These How Can We Lose? Commentary by Captain Paul Watson Founder and President of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society The Dark Knight is a Shepherd of the Sea A few days ago, Christian Bale departed from Heathrow Airport en route to Japan wearing a Sea Shepherd Jolly Roger shirt. Bale, who recently played the Caped Crusader, has been a long time supporter of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Heath Ledger who played the Joker in the movie was also a supporter of Sea Shepherd and had joined the Sea Shepherd Board of Advisors only a few months before his tragic and untimely death. With Richard Dean Anderson on the Sea Shepherd Board of Directors, with Pierce Brosnan on the Sea Shepherd Board of Advisors and with William Shatner and Christian Bale as supporters that means that Sea Shepherd has MacGyver, James Bond, Captain Kirk and Batman fighting alongside us in our efforts to save our oceans from the forces of greed and destruction.
