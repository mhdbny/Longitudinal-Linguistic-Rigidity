The show took place December 1 st in Ghent. Having been a huge fan since 1987, SSCS Belgium Director, Anne Van Ingelgem, was delighted; not just for the concert, but also for the opportunity to spread awareness of Sea Shepherd?s work.  ?It was a fantastic gig!? she exclaimed.  ?The Scabs played all my favorite songs: Matchbox Car, So Called Friends, Nothing on my Radio, I Need You, and many more. They were sharp and on point!? Frontman Guy Swinnen wore a Sea Shepherd T-shirt for the duration of the performance and guitarist Willy Willy proudly displayed the Sea Shepherd Jolly Roger logo shirt during the encore. Sea Shepherd wants to thank the Scabs for their support. It means a great deal to us.  We look forward to working with the Scabs again in the future to spread awareness of the issues facing our oceans.
