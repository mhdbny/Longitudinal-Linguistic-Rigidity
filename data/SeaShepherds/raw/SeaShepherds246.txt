 August 22, 2007 Killing Fish for Fun and Profit Commentary by Paul Watson Founder and President of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society It is a very strange world we live in, a world where destruction of nature is rewarded and those who seek to protect and defend nature are punished. As we struggle to raise funds to protect and defend whales, seals, sea turtles, sharks, dolphins and fish, the killers reap large financial rewards for destroying the largest and strongest fish in the seas. The White Marlin Open is the largest fishing tournament in the world. People who take joy and pleasure from murdering fish come from all over the world to hunt down and take the biggest and the best White Marlins, Bluefin, Tuna, Dolphin (Dorado or Mahi Mahi) Wahoo and Shark.  (please insert photo named: Frankoswhite.jpg) Following are the prize winning killers for 2008. This illustrates the obscene amount of money these aquatic nimrods can win for inflicting pain, misery and death on such wonderful and important creatures in our marine eco-systems.

Over 400 boats participated in this orgy of death, so the slaughter of fish was very high with thousands of large fish taken that did not qualify for a prize. Very strange and very true. The madness amongst some people is so incredibly bizarre that this incredible pay-off in return for who gets the biggest fish is simply insane. But there are corporate sponsors willing to pay for this nonsense. We need to let these sponsors know that we won't purchase products from companies that sponsor fish killing competitions. Our oceans are dying and fish are being diminished around the world and this nonsense simply perpetuates the idea that humans can lay waste to the sea for fun and profit. The competition was not without controversy this year. Activists struck back on behalf of the fish. Donning scuba gear the activists holed the hulls and damaged the props on eight boats as the U.S. Coast Guard patrolled the marina and security guards prowled the docks. 8 boats were permanently damaged and did not participate in the killing that day. Although the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society does not condone damaging boats and gear utilized for legal fishing, we could not help but smile knowing that 8 of these fish killing for pleasure boats were knocked out of the competition. "The White Marlin Open may be legal but it is immoral, and there is no justification for such an orgy of destruction in a world where 90% of the ocean's large fish have already been exterminated," said Captain Paul Watson. "These magnificent creatures are being slaughtered, not for food and not for people to make a living but to provide bragging rights to a bunch of yahoos who want to have their picture taken next to the corpse of a creature more noble than themselves."
