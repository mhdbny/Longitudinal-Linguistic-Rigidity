April 3, 2014 â€” The decision of the United States Supreme Court in McCutcheon vs. Federal Election Commission both reflects and encourages a distressing trend in the American political process. While the right of free expression is the foundation of democracy and a free society, the domination of the public forum by big money drowns out those voices that reflect broad constituencies, but not big finances. Political decision-making must be based on the premise of one citizen/one vote, not on who can round up the richest backer. Reasonable, realistic, and balanced regulations that will limit the opportunity for a few wealthy individuals to overwhelm the election process will strengthen our democracy.
