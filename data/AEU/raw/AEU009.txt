As the news about the Orlando shooting trickled in over the course of the weekend, we all had a sense of déjà vu. Once again senseless violence leaves dozens dead and wounded and thousands mourning the loss of loved ones. I share with all of you a deep sadness about such suffering.
As pundits and politicians scramble to put their particular spin on the situation, I resist joining in the fray. Over the next weeks we will have endless analysis of the shooter and the horror he inflicted. We will debate issues from ISIS, terrorism, homophobia, and our civic inability to enact sensible gun control. None of these debates will do enough to make sense of our sadness, anger, frustration, and confusion.
Each of us will have to decide how best to move on in lives. May we resist the corrosive effects of hopelessness and resignation; may we all find a way to transform the darkness by seeking ways to bring light to the world. Perhaps it will awaken in us our commitment to responsible citizenship. At the very least, let us be kind to those we meet today. Let us nurture the love in our hearts.
