    June 18, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Dying As A Means Of Loving (Part One)   (John 12:20-26)          Now there were certain Greeks among thosewho were going up to    worship at the feast; these therefore came to Philip, who wasfrom Bethsaida of Galilee,    and began to ask him, saying, Sir, we wish to seeJesus. Philip *came and    *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came, and they * told Jesus.And Jesus *answered them,    saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to beglorified. Truly, truly, I    say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth anddies, it remains by itself    alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves hislife loses it; and he who    hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal. Ifanyone serves Me, let him    follow Me; and where I am, there shall My servant also be; ifanyone serves Me, the Father    will honor him.              We Wish To See Jesus     Summer is for doing what these Greekswanted to do. Verse 21 says  they came to Philip and said, Sir, we wish to seeJesus. Summer is for seeing  and showing Christ. We want to see Jesus, they said. And I say, Ido too. That is what I  want to happen in my life this summer. I want to see him soclearly and so powerfully that  I am changed form one degree of glory to another into his image sothat I can show him to  others more compellingly.    So did they get to see him -- these Greeks?Most likely they did. But  the way Jesus handled the request is probably not what theyexpected. They said, We  wish to see Jesus. So Philip and Andrew came and told Jesus(v. 22). Does he show  himself to them? Yes he does. The same way he shows himself to us -- with truth about  himself that becomes a truth about us. This is the way Jesusappears in power: he gives  truth about himself that becomes truth about us.    He says in verse 23,          [So there are Greeks who want to see me? Hereis the truth about me    that matters for Greeks who want to see me and know me:] The hour has come for    the Son of Man to be glorified.        I am on my way to glory. I really will besomething to see. They are  right to want to see me. I will be the most glorious person tobehold in the universe when  my Father raises me from the dead and gives me a name which isabove every name that at my  name every knee will bow -- including the Greeks and thebarbarians. Yes, they are right  to want to see me -- and even want to be identified with me.    But here is a truth that they may not expect.Verse 24:          Truly, truly, I say to you, unless agrain of wheat falls into the    earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, itbears much fruit.        My pathway to glory is through death. Do youwant to see that? I will  indeed bear much fruit -- including Greeks -- But I will not and Icannot bear this fruit  any way but through dying. Tell the Greeks that I will not come tothem now, because I  have a hard work to do so that I might bear them as the fruit ofmy life and ministry. If  I leave the road I&#146;m on to go and be seen by men, I willremain alone and you and the  Greeks will not be saved. But if I go and die on my way to glory,then I will bear much  fruit -- you will be saved and the Greeks will be saved, and allwho believe in me will be  saved. This is what I want them to see. See me dying. See mebearing fruit.    That is the truth about Jesus that he revealsto the Greeks. But now it  also becomes a truth about them -- and about us. Jesus&#146; self-revelation is always a  confrontation. He says in verse 25 and 26: my dying for yoursalvation is also my design  for your imitation. If you want to see me, be prepared to becomelike me. This is what  happens. Do you mean it: We wish to see Jesus? Do wemean it this morning?  Jesus says, If you mean it -- if you want to see me -- prepare tobecome like me. Prepare  to follow me on the road I am going.    So he says, (v. 25):         He who loves his life loses it; and he whohates his life in this world    shall keep it to life eternal. If anyone serves Me, let himfollow Me [Where? To    Gethsemane and to Calvary and to the grave]; and where I am,there shall My servant also    be [in the presence of my Father in glory]; if anyone serves Me,the Father will honor    him.       So Jesus begins with truth about himself -- thehour has come for the  Son of Man to be glorified and this will happen by the grain ofwheat falling into the  ground and dying. Then he makes the truth about himself a truthabout his followers. Will  we hate our lives in this world? Will we follow him on the path toCalvary? Will we serve  the Son in this way? Will we let the truth about the Son of Manbecome truth about us?    This is the way we see Jesus and the way weshow Jesus. He reveals  himself to us as a Person who goes to glory and bears much fruitby dying -- by hating his  life in this world. That&#146;s what we see. And then he says,Follow me. Die with me.  Hate your life in this world with me. Serve me. And if we do, weshow Christ to the world.  Christ means to be seen by the Greeks and by every other peoplegroup in the world. And  the way he means for it to happen is by our becoming like him inhis dying so that others  may see him in us (2 Cor. 4:10).     The Way Is Hard And Glorious     Two things are unmistakable here. One isthat this is hard. And the  other is that this is glorious. Don&#146;t miss either of these.If you only see the hard  part you will miss the power and the freedom. If you only see theglorious part you will  minimize the sacrifice. So let me show you four hard things andfour glorious things.    First, the hard things:         Verse 24: the grain of wheat must die.Unless the grain of wheat    fall into the ground and die...       Verse 25: Jesus calls us to hate our lives inthis world, He who    loves his life loses it; and he who hates his life in thisworld...      Verse 26a: Jesus calls us to follow him -- onhis Calvary road, leading    to death. If anyone serves me let him follow me...      Finally, verse 26b: he calls us to serve him.To take the role of a    waiter at his table to do his bidding, no matter what the demandor how lowly the status.       Now that is what it means to be a Christian, adisciple of Jesus. And  it is hard. Jesus knew it would be hard. That&#146;s why he saidin Matthew 7:14,  The gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life,and those who find it  are few. It is hard to die. It is hard to hate your life inthis world. It is hard  to follow Jesus on the road that leads to the cross. It is hard totake the role of a  servant in a world of power.    But it is also glorious. And the glorycompensates for the hardness of  it all. In fact the glory turns the hardness of it into the mostsignificant life  imaginable. Just this week I was reading about the search forsignificance. Do you know  what next year is? Beginning January 1, 1996 and continuing forthe next 18 years someone  in America will turn 50 every 1.8 seconds. So the books arerolling off the press, because  one thing we Baby Boomers know how to do is cash in on our life-stages. And virtually all  the books address the theme of significance versus success.You&#146;re fifty. You&#146;ve  made it in your career. How do you feel about it? Not so great.Well, take stock of the  last 15 and go for significance not success. That&#146;s themessage.    It&#146;s a good one. And the good news is thatyou 20-year-olds  don&#146;t have to wait till you&#146;re fifty for a life ofsignificance and you  70-year-olds don&#146;t have to think that it&#146;s too late. Thelife Jesus is calling  for here is glorious in its outcome and therefore deeplysignificant in its hardness.    Here&#146;s the glory:         Verse 24: Yes the seed must die, but ifit dies it bears much    fruit. The death is not in vain. It is significant. Itbears fruit.      Verse 25: Yes, if we love our lives we willlose them; and yes, we must    hate our lives in this world. But why? What will be the outcome?That we may keep it to    eternal life. He who hates his life in this world shallkeep it to life    eternal. What we lay down for Christ he will put in ourhands again with glory. You    cannot out-sacrifice his resurrection generosity.      Verse 26a: yes, we must follow him toCalvary. But with what outcome?    And where I am, there shall my servant be. Jesusused those very words one    other time (John 14:3), and he meant heaven: I go toprepare a place for you that    where I am there you may be also. If we follow him toCalvary we will be with him in    heaven.      Verse 26b: yes, we must become his servants.But what does the Father    do to his servants? If anyone serves Me, the Father willhonor him.        So don&#146;t miss the glory in thishard life of being a  Christian.           We die;            We hate our lives in this world;            We follow Jesus on the Calvary road;            We become servants.             And when we do, what we find isthat           We bear much fruit;            We keep our lives for eternal life;            We join Jesus where he is in glory;            The Father honors us.            At least for  this  almost-fifty-year-oldthat sounds like the way  I want to live the few remaining years I have left in this world,and how I want to spend  eternity. I invite you to join me. It won&#146;t be easy, but itwill be significant.     Before Revival and Fruit Bearing: Death     We are praying for revival in ourfellowship and across the Twin  Cities and around the world -- that God would come in great self-evidencing power and make  his church vibrant and strong and bold and joyful and radical inallegiance to him. When  this text (John 12:24-26) came to me Saturday a week ago, it camewith the force of a  warning and an invitation: beware of praying toward revival. Why?Because before there  will be the life of revival there is the dying of reward. Bewareof praying toward great  fruitfulness in ministry and in your personal life. Why? Becauseonly if the grain of  wheat falls into the ground and dies does it bear much fruit Knowwhat you are asking. But  if you are willing, I invite you to seek this. This is the mostsignificant life there is  on the planet. Not many are willing to even think about it. But Ioffer it to you in  Jesus&#146; name.    So I have been asking myself earnestly, and Iwant you to ask with me  this morning, What in me must die? What must die formy life and ministry to  bear more fruit? Is there a corporate dying that we have to gothrough in order to bear  more fruit? What in our church must die for us to bear more fruit?It&#146;s a scary  question -- personally and corporately.    It has a lot to do with love. That is what Iwill try to show you next  week from 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 -- how love is the topside of thisdying. That is, what  lives when all dies that ought to die is love. It was an amazingdiscovery for me to  compare John 12:24-26 with 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. That&#146;s whatwe&#146;ll do next week.    I had planned on doing that this week. But themore I thought about  this issue of dying for the sake of fruit-bearing the more I feltI needed to see this in  the bigger picture of what it means to be a Christian. Idon&#146;t what you to get the  impression that this word from the Lord is a little peripheralword. This word about dying  and hating your life in this world is not a marginal word. It is acentral word. So let me  draw things to a close today by showing you what I mean.     There are two straightforwardpoints.     First,   if you are a Christian you havealready died  . This  is not a second or third stage in the Christian life. This is themeaning of becoming a  Christian. Becoming a Christian means dying. Here are the keytexts: Galatians 5:24,          Now those who belong to Christ Jesus havecrucified the flesh with    its passions and desires.        Note the tense: if we belong to Christ (thatis, if we are true  Christians) this is what has happened to us. Our flesh -- that oldrebellious,  unbelieving, self-centered person we were apart from Christ -- wascrucified. That is,  when we put our faith in Christ, we were united to him and what heexperienced, we  experienced (Romans 6:5). His death became our death so that hislife might become our  life.    Don&#146;t panic here, thinking, O thatcan&#146;t be, I still  have some very rebellious, unbelieving, self-centeredtendencies. Yes, me too. But  do not let your experience become the main authority here. Theword of God says,  Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh.That is something we are  called to believe and live by.    Or consider the word in Colossians 3:3,             You have died and your life is hidden withChrist in God.          This is what happened to you when you became aChristian. This is the  meaning of your baptism:          We have been buried with Him throughbaptism into death, in order    that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of theFather, so we too might    walk in newness of life (Romans 6:4).        Becoming a Christian means a decisive death tothe old and a newness of  life, walking by faith with Christ. Paul put it like this inGalatians 2:20:          I am crucified with Christ, it is nolonger I who live but Christ    who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live byfaith in the Son of God    who loved me and gave himself for me.        My old unbelieving self died; the me that liveslives by faith (moment  by moment) in Christ.    So when I ask myself and you about dying as ameans to revival we must  understand that we are not talking about becoming Christians allover again. We are not  denying that something glorious has happened to us decisively andalready and once for  all. It has. We have been joined to Christ by the Holy Spirit andwe have died with him  and are walking in newness of life in him. Our life is hid withChrist in God. Something  eternal and magnificent has happened.    So why am I asking, when I say, What inme must die that I might  be a more fruitful father and husband and pastor? What in us mustdie as a church for us  to be more fruitful? I said a moment ago that there are twostraightforward points.  The first was, if you are a Christian you have already died.    Now the second one is:   If you are aChristian, God calls you to  die daily  . Or, if you don&#146;t like paradoxes, God callsus to experience  practically in daily life what is true about us positionally inChrist. In Christ we are  dead to sin and our lives are hidden in Christ in God. Now becausethat is your position  in God&#146;s reckoning, put it into practical experience. Infact, making it true in  practice by the power of the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:13) is theevidence that this is your  position.    Where do I find this second point in the Bible?First, I find it in the  words of Jesus, Luke 9:23,          If anyone wishes to come after Me, lethim deny himself, and take    up his cross  daily , and follow Me.        The word daily shows that followingJesus means a daily  dying, not only a once-for-all dying. Each day I must experiencein practice what is true  of me in my position in Christ. I am once for all crucifiedwith Christ (Gal.  2:20; 5:24) -- that&#146;s my position; my life is hid with Christin God (Col. 3:3).  Therefore I must believe this reality and act on it and experienceit. I must become in  practice   what I am in my  position . And the practice confirms thereality of the position.    The other place I find this truth is in theapostle Paul&#146;s  letters. In Romans 6, after saying in verse 5 that we wereunited with [Christ] in  the likeness of his death, and after saying in verse 6 thatour old self was  crucified with him, then he says in verse 11 Consideryourselves to be dead to  sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. In other words, youare dead with Christ --  that is your position; therefore consider yourselves dead tosin --  demonstrate your position by your practice.    It&#146;s the same in Colossians 3. Aftersaying in verse 3 that  you have died and your life is hid with Christ in God,he says in verse 5,          Therefore put to death the member [ofyour sinful body] on the    earth, immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, andgreed.        You have died and your position is in Christ.Now experience this death  in your fight with sin. Put to death your sinning self. Show whoyou really are in Christ  by trusting his promises above all else.    I want you to glory in what it means to be aChristian. You do not  become a Christian by working away at all the things you must dieto. You become a  Christian by a decisive work of God in you and by a decisivesurrender to Jesus Christ  through which, by faith in him, he becomes your substitute andyour Lord. Then comes a  life-long experience of becoming in practice what you are by yourposition. And that  becoming -- called sanctification -- strengthens your assurancethat you are real.     So what I am asking myself and you isthis:           Is there something God is calling me todie to that I might      experience more fully my position in Christ; that I might seeChrist more clearly and show      him more compellingly?            Am I striving against my very nature as aChristian by trying to keep      alive something God sentenced to death when I became aChristian?            Are my weaknesses as a father or ahusband or a witness owing to      something that needs to die in me -- some old habit, somesecret sin, some root of pride,      some fear of looking silly, some desperate need for approval,some desire for wealth?            Next week I want to share with you what theLord is showing me about  how loving each other is what this dying is all about. But thismorning let&#146;s just  soberly ask ourselves the question: is there something that ishindering my fruitfulness  of Christ -- something that keeps me from seeing him and showinghim -- something that I  need to die to? Lord show us what it is; and we will obey the wordand put it to death by  the Spirit (Romans 8:13).    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
