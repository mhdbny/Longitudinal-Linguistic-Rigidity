      December 3, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church:    Volume 10      Diversity in God-CenteredWorship   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document   Unfolding Fresh Initiative # 4    Fresh Initiatives     For the Immediate Future of our Mission          Our  mission  and  Spiritual Dynamic declare that the  all-satisfying supremacy of God shines most brightly throughsacrificial deeds of joyful  love .  The cry of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of our people is for afresh, decisive emphasis  on  relationships of   Love .      Therefore we eagerly embrace God&#146;scall for new, visible  manifestations of love toward each other, our guests and ourneighbors. With a fresh  openness and outgoing spirit to each other and to all new people,we henceforth put  understanding above accusation, forbearance above faultfinding,and Biblical unity above  the demand for uniformity.     * * *    3.   Diversity in God-centered worship.  Sunday morning  worship is a corporate expression of our passion for the supremacyof God. We sense  God&#146;s leading to develop fresh expressions of this passionthat 1) allow for a more  focused and free lingering of love in the presence of the Lord; 2)reflect musically the  diversity of our congregation and our metropolitan culture; and 3)interweave the values  of intense God-centeredness and more personal ministry to eachother in the power of the  Holy Spirit.    We are unfolding each of the six FreshInitiatives in the Mission and  Vision booklet during these weeks. Today we will take up #4, Diversity in God-centered  Worship , saving #3 for Martin Luther King weekend on January14. Next week we will  take up #5 and then save #6 for Sanctity of Life Sunday, January21.     Our aim in these days is to give a flavor ofwhat the changes implied  in the Fresh Initiatives might look like and what the Biblicalfoundations for them are.  This week we will reverse the order of last week. We will beginwith the word and move to  Fresh Initiative #4.     Romans 15:1-7     The Word I would like us to look like isRomans 15:1-7          Now we who are strong ought to bear theweaknesses of those without    strength and not  just  please ourselves. 2 Leteach of us please his    neighbor for his good, to his edification. 3 For even Christ didnot please Himself; but    as it is written, THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHEDTHEE FELL UPON ME. 4    For whatever was written in earlier times was written for ourinstruction, that through    perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we mighthave hope. 5 Now may the God    who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of thesame mind with one another    according to Christ Jesus; 6 that with one accord you may withone voice glorify the God    and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Wherefore, accept oneanother, just as Christ also    accepted us to the glory of God.        Summary observations:    Ponder these especially in the light of thedifference in preferences  regarding worship forms at Bethlehem.    1)  Verses 1-2 : There are strongChristians and non-strong  Christians in the church.         Examples:       a) Romans 14:2 -- those who have faith to eatanything, and those who    eat only vegetables      b) Romans 14:5 -- those who regard one dayabove another and those who    regard all days alike.             2)  Verses 1-2 : Paul assumes thatthese differences cannot be      wiped away simply by his teaching or praying, for he givesinstructions for how to live      with them, not how to remove them so that you don&#146;t haveto live with them.        3)  Verses 1-2 : The way to live withthese differences and move      beyond them is by putting a premium on edification and self-denial.        a) V. 2: seek to please others for theiredification -- what will build      the faith of others and help them to live more by faith infuture grace? This will move      the weak toward strength and guard the strong frompresumption.        b) V. 1: so don&#146;t make it a priorityto please yourself. Be the      kind of person who finds more satisfaction in denying yourpreferences for the good of      others.        [NOTE: this is a mindset that sets thestage for solving problems of      diversity; but is not the solution to what food will be servedor days celebrated or music      played.]        4)  Verse 3 : Christ is the exampleand empowering inspiration for      us in these two things: he did not please himself, but he tookon himself reproaches that      were not his to bear, so that good could come to others.        [NOTE: He was trying to bring about changein the world. He was not out      to simply take people where they were and please them in theircorrupt preferences. The      point is not that we have no desire for others to change, butthat our strategy is to      suffer for them.]        5)  Verse 4 : Scripture is held out tous as our source for      perseverance and encouragement to sustain our hope in thesometimes frustrating      experiences of self-denial and love.        6)  Verse 5 : The prayer that God giveus the same mind ( to      auta phronein ) does not mean immediately that he give usthe same preferences about      foods or days (or music forms), but that he give us the samespiritual values referred to      here in these verses. When he says according to Christ,its the same as      Christ&#146;s being given as a model in verse 3 -- a model ofthese values:         a) the value of doing all for theedification of another&#146;s faith;         b) the value of self-denial in thatministry;         c) and the following value of exalting theall-satisfying value of God      the Father through Jesus Christ.        7)  Verse 6 : the aim of all this wayof living together with      common values of building faith and denying self is that wemight  worship as we ought  --      glorify the God and Father of our Lord JesusChrist.        a)  with one accord  -- that&#146;sthe inner unity of verse 5,      the shared spiritual values, not the shared preferences.        b)  with one voice  (literally: mouth)-- this is the outer form      unity that has to be found for a congregation.        [NOTE: It need not imply, I think, totaldilution of all cultural      differences into one service form or language. For example, Ithink that language      differences can be respected and probably others things aswell in separate services. But      the tendency here, as last week in Colossians 3:11 is that weaim at overcoming the      non-essential things that divide us and work toward expressingand experiencing unity in      the spiritual values -- especially, now the main aim and valueof all GLORIFYING GOD THE      FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.]             Diversity in God-Centered Worship     Now this leads to our Fresh Initiative #4, Diversity in  God-centered worship.  Read it in the light of the thirteenvalue statements on page  six of the mission/vision statement booklet.    Observations on Fresh Initiative #4:    1)  The abiding foundation of our corporateworship is  God-centeredness . This is implied in our Mission Statement --a passion for the  supremacy of God. We need to feel this from beginning to end thatwe are driven by a  passion for the supremacy of God&#146;s worth and greatness andthe manifold beauty of all  his perfections.    2)  Subpoint 1 :            focused : minimize neutralminds and distracted    heads and disengaged hearts. Engagement, intensity, earnestcommunion with the Lord.    Thinking and feeling directed to him.        free : Saying Amen,lifting hands, clapping,    standing or sitting, using overhead or hymnal, kneeling, prayingaloud when the    opportunity is given.      . ..lingering : not feelingrushed from one expression    of worship to another and not leaving a truth or a moment ofencounter too quickly. Using    simple tunes and lyrics to assist in assimilating more rich andcomplex texts. For    example, following the five verses of Amazing Grace with therepetitions    Hallelujah to the same tune. There are reasons forrepeating a song text two    or three times: a) getting familiar with the words and tune; b)being relaxed in them; c)    connecting with the Lord with no work on the text and music.      ...i n the presence : asense of the Lord&#146;s    nearness to receive our worship. A speaking directly to him andnot just about him to each    other, though that is biblically legitimate.        3)  Subpoint 2 : reflect diversityof our congregation and  culture.         a)  We are diverse in what helps us connectwith God . We want to    expand the range where we can meet each other. This was impliedlast week in the    significant range of Fresh Initiative #2.      b) This is not to be conceived as a varietyshow or worship mall each    Sunday, but as  a new unified personality that will beuniquely us . It will be    influenced mainly by these things: 1) the Holy Spirit; 2) theBible; 3) the inevitable    influence of our history; 4) this mission-vision document; 5)the fleshing out of this    document by the worship and music task force in its documents;6) the ongoing input of the    congregation in its responsiveness to what is happening; 7) thegifts and personality and    musical breadth and spirituality of the new lead worshipper; 8)me.      c) The culture is not unimportant: we are notgoing to use instruments    only familiar in Bangkok or Kankan.  We will try to find abalance between being so    unlike our culture musically that there is little naturalresonance; or so like our    culture that there is little sense of the uniqueness of God.            4)  Subpoint 3 : interweave valuesof intense  God-centeredness and more personal ministry to each other in thepower of the Holy  Spirit.         Examples: including in the service thingslike praying for a missionary    family at the offering time; praying for the Larson&#146;s intheir crisis a few months    ago; praying in clusters at certain crucial points in the churchlife; inviting the people    to come forward for prayer about missions three weeks ago;encouraging ministries to one    another before and after the services in this room; otherpossibilities where God may want    to bring the word more immediately to bear on individuals in theservices.       The key will be that Christ is all in all.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
