          THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH ARE THE SONS OF   ABRAHAM     (Galatians 3:6-9)             
         Thus Abraham "believed      God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness." So you see      that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the      scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by      faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In      you shall all the nations be blessed." So then, those who are      men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.                     
          The Word of God from this text for us today   is that anyone -- Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, male or female,   white or black or brown, quick-witted or slow, old or   young--anyone can be a child of Abraham and inherit the blessings   promised to Abraham's children if you live by faith. The structure   of the text is simple. The main point is stated in two different   ways, once in verse 7 and once in verse 9. And each of these is   preceded by its Old Testament support. Verse six quotes Genesis   15:6, "Abraham 'believed God and it was reckoned to him as   righteousness."' And verse 7 draws out of that verse together with   verse 5 a general inference: "So (or: therefore) you see that it   is those of faith who are sons of Abraham." The thing that makes a   person a "son of Abraham" is faith. Then verse 8 quotes Genesis   12:3 (and 18:18), "In you shall all the nations be blessed." And   verse 9 draws out the inference, "So then, those who are of faith   are blessed with Abraham who had faith." The thing that qualifies   a person to inherit Abraham's blessing is faith. So the main point   -- the Word of God for us today (expressed in verses 7 and 9) --   is that anyone of us who lives by faith is a child of Abraham and   will inherit Abraham's blessing.              I can think of at least two reasons why most   modern people would simply shrug their shoulders at this   announcement. One reason is that they have no idea what it means   to be a son of Abraham and no sense of the stupendous value of the   blessing promised to Abraham's children. And the other reason is   that they can't see how a 20th century American who doesn't have a   Jewish cell in his body can be called a son of Abraham. In other   words, if this promise in Gal. 3:6-9 is going to strengthen our   faith and increase our joy we have to dig in and see what it means   and how it is grounded in the Old Testament. And that's my aim:   the advancement and joy of your faith (Phil. 1:25), because I know   that genuine faith works itself out in love (Gal. 5:6) and when   people see the sacrificial love of God's people many are gripped   and give glory to him (Mt. 5:16). So for the sake of our faith,   our love and ultimately, of God's glory, let's see how Paul gets   verses 7 and 9 out of the Old Testament and what they mean for us   today.              A great deal in this passage hangs on what   it means to be a son of Abraham. So let's try to answer that   question first. The first thing that needs to be said is that Paul   thinks sonship does not depend on physical descent. For example,   in 3:28, 29 he says, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is   neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you   are all one in Christ. And if you are Christ's, then you are   Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise." So the first   thing to be said is that Jews and non-Jews can be offspring or   children or sons of Abraham. Sonship does not depend on physical   descent. Romans 9:6,7 confirm this: "Not all who are descended   from Israel belong to Israel, and not all are children of Abraham   just because they are descendants." But we don't even have to go   beyond our text to see this. Aren't verses 7 and 9 referring to   the same group of people? Verse 7 says that "those of faith are   sons of Abraham." And verse 9 says that "those of faith are   blessed with Abraham." Surely, these are the same people: sons of   Abraham who will therefore enjoy the blessings promised to Abraham   and his children. But it is clear from the connection between   verses 8 and 9 that these people include Gentiles. Verse 8 quotes   Genesis 12:3, "In you shall all the nations (i.e., Gentiles) be   blessed" -- not just Jews. And from that Paul infers verse 9: "So   then, those of faith are blessed." So the believers of verse 9   must include Gentiles, and since these are the same as the   believers in verse 7 who are called Sons of Abraham, the sons of   Abraham must include Gentiles. That's the first thing about being   a son of Abraham: it does not depend on physical descent from   Abraham.              I know it sounds strange to us, but it is   very close to the heart of the gospel: white Anglo-Saxon   protestants can become sons of Abraham, Hispanics and Laotians and   Cambodians can become sons of Abraham; black African Muslims can   become sons of Abraham; anti-semitic, redneck Nazi vigilantes can   become sons of Abraham; Hitler could have become a son of   Abraham.              Before we ask what that sonship involves and   why it is good news, we need to ask whether Paul's view of   Abrahamic sonship is the same as the Old Testament's view. It is   no good telling our Jewish friends that we are sons of Abraham if   they can simply point to the Torah and show us that Paul has   distorted what Moses taught. Turn with me to Genesis 12:1-3. Here   is the foundational promise of the Jewish people. "Now the Lord   said to Abram, 'Go from your country and your kindred and your   father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make   of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name   great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who   bless you and him who curses you I will curse, and in you shall   all the families of the earth be blessed."' When God chose Abram   to found a new nation he made sure that Abram knew that the Jewish   people were being created  for the world . Their mission is   to " be  a blessing." Their destiny is to serve all the   nations. (Genesis 18:18 says the same thing, and uses "nations" =   Gentiles, instead of "families.") This is the text Paul quotes in   Galatians 3:8, "In you shall all the nations be blessed."              But is this blessing which the nations get   the same as sonship? Is there any clue in Genesis that the nations   would be blessed in Abraham because they would become his sons?   Yes, there is in Genesis 17. Here God spells out the terms of his   covenant with Abraham and says in verses 4,5, "Behold, my covenant   is with you, and you shall be the  father of a multitude of   nations . No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name   shall be Abraham, for I have made you the  father of a multitude   of nations ." Some have tried to refer the "nations" here to   the Ishmaelites and Edomites, who can trace their physical descent   to Abraham. But surely the word "multitude" in Gen. 17:4,5 means   more than two. Surely God has in view here the same nations that   will be blessed in Gen. 12:3 and 18:18, namely, "all the families   (nations) of the earth." In other words, Genesis 17:4 explains how   the nations of Gen. 12:3 and 18:18 are going to be blessed. They   are going to be blessed because Abraham will become their father.   They are going to be blessed by becoming sons of Abraham. So it   does not look as though Paul has distorted the Old Testament when   he teaches that Gentiles can be sons of Abraham. That's the first   thing we need to see about Abraham's children -- they include more   than Jews. They can include you and me. (See Romans 4:16 and 17 to   confirm that Gen. 17:4 lies behind Paul's thinking about Gentile   sonship.)              The second thing to notice about being a   child of Abraham is that it means  being like Abraham . In   John 8:39 the Jews defend themselves against Jesus' criticisms by   saying, "'Abraham is our father.' Jesus said to them, 'If you were   Abraham's children you would do what Abraham did."' Jesus shows us   two things in this response. First, he shows us that they are    not  Abraham's children even though they are Jews -- and so   he confirms our first point, that being a child of Abraham is not   the same as Jewishness. And the second thing he shows us is that   being a child of Abraham means being like Abraham--doing what he   does: "If you were Abraham's children you would do what Abraham   did." In Galatians 3:6 what Abraham did was believe God. "Abraham   believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness" (Gen.   15:6). Then Paul infers from this in verse 7, "So you see, it is   those of faith who are sons of Abraham." Abraham was a man of   faith, so if you do what he did, if you have faith, you will be   his child.              So the first thing we said about being sons   of Abraham is that it's not the same as being a physical   descendant. Anyone here can become a child of Abraham. Now the   second thing we've said is that being a son of Abraham involves   doing what he did -- not in every particular, of course, but in   the essential thing, namely, believing God's promises. Abraham   believed God; therefore, those of faith are sons of Abraham.              The third thing to say about sons of Abraham   is that they are heirs of the blessing to Abraham and his   descendants. Gal. 3:29 makes this especially clear: "If you are   Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring,  heirs  according   to the promise." Remember, this comes right after verse 28 which   shows that Paul has in mind here male and female, slave and free,   Jew and Greek. The most astonishing thing asserted here is that   Greeks -- uncircumcised Gentiles! -- are heirs of the promises   made to Abraham. You and I can become beneficiaries of God's   promises to Abraham if we have the faith of Abraham and belong to   Jesus Christ. (Romans 4:16, 17 also shows that Gentiles are made   heirs of "the promise" because of faith. See also Gal. 3:14 and   4:30.)              Those are the three things I wanted to say   about being children of Abraham: 1) It is not the same thing as   being Jewish, Gentiles can be included; 2) it means being like   Abraham, especially trusting the promises of God like Abraham did;   3) it means inheriting the blessings promised to Abraham.              So the question that begs to be answered now   is: What are those blessings? Is there anything in this   inheritance that should interest a twentieth-century American   businessman, housewife, student, professional, laborer, teenager,   senior citizen? I think there is. I'll mention two of them -- two   things that you inherit if you are a child of Abraham. And each of   these is promised in order to take away a fear that you have (or   ought to have): 1) The fear of meeting an infinitely holy God   loaded with all your sin; and 2) the fear of death.              First, if you are a child of Abraham part of   your guaranteed inheritance is the bequest of justification. And   only justification can take away your fear of meeting God loaded   with your sin. Notice Gal. 3:8, "And the Scripture, foreseeing   that God would  justify  the Gentiles by faith preached the   gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, 'In you shall all the   nations be blessed."' This verse teaches that the reason the   Scripture promises blessing to the nations through Abraham is that   God intended to justify people from every nation. "Since the   Scripture saw God justifying the Gentiles &#133; therefore the   Scripture promised blessing to the Gentiles through Abraham." So   the promised blessing of Abraham must involve justification. And   you recall from the connection between Genesis 12:3 and 17:4 that   the reason the nations will be blessed is because Abraham becomes   their father. They become his sons. Therefore, justification is   part of our inheritance as children of Abraham. If you are his   child, and only then, you are justified.              Which means that in spite of all your sins   God reckons you to be righteous. If you are a child of Abraham all   the things you have done wrong or ever will do wrong are forgiven   because of Christ, and God does not hold your sins against you. I   don't know of any cultural, intellectual or technological changes   over the past two thousand years that makes this inheritance any   less needed or less desirable today than it was for the Galatians.   This and this alone can take away the fear of meeting an   infinitely holy God loaded with our sin. So the first thing we   inherit from God as children of Abraham is justification,   acquittal of all our sin. (And this is the basis for all the other   blessings!)              Second, if you are a child of Abraham part   of your guaranteed inheritance is the Spirit of God who seals you   for eternal life. Only the Spirit can take away the fear of death   and hell and replace it with the hope of eternal life. Notice two   key texts from Galatians which make this plain. Gal. 3:14 says   that Christ became a curse for us "that in Christ Jesus the   blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in order that we   might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." This verse   teaches that part of Abraham's blessing which we Gentiles can   inherit is the gift of the Spirit. One of the marks of the   children of Abraham is that they are indwelt by the Spirit of   Christ (2:20; 4:6,29).              The connection between this and eternal life   is then brought out in Galatians 6:8, "He who sows to his own   flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the   Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life." The only ground   out of which eternal life can be harvested is the ground of the   Spirit. If you plant your life in the flesh, if you count on what    you  can achieve and enjoy in this world, then the harvest   you will get is corruption, death and hell, for that is an   immeasurable insult to God who offers himself to you in the   Spirit. But if you plant your life in the Spirit and count on what    he  can do through you and for you the harvest you will get   is  eternal life . So when Gal. 3:14 says that the Spirit is   a part of our inheritance as children of Abraham, it implies that   only the children of Abraham will enjoy eternal life. And that   takes away the fear of death and hell, which is just as real and   terrible in the twentieth century as it was in the first. (Note:   the Spirit is not explicitly promised to Abraham in Genesis. It is   promised to God's people in Joel 2 and Ezekiel 36. Paul's   assumption is that whatever goes into making the children of   Abraham what they ought to be is a fulfillment of God's intention   in the promise to Abraham. See Gen. 17:7.)              In summary, we have seen five things about   what it means to be children of Abraham. 1) It is not the same as   physical descent from Abraham. Even twentieth century Gentiles can   be Abraham's sons. 2) It implies being like Abraham, a chip off   the old block, as it were, especially in his life of faith. 3) If   you are a child of Abraham you inherit the blessing of Abraham.   You become the beneficiary of the promises God made to his   children. That means 4) you are justified, acquitted by God of all   your sins on the basis of Christ's death in your place. And   finally, 5) if you are Abraham's child you have the Spirit who   will lead you into eternal life.              Therefore, it is surely no overstatement   this morning to say that the most important concern of your life   is to make sure that you are a child of Abraham. So I close with   an observation from our text and an illustration. The text makes   plain that the only way to be a child of Abraham is to live by   faith. Literally, Gal. 3:7 says, "Know therefore that  those of   faith , these are the sons of Abraham." The test of whether you   are  of faith , not whether you once made a decision   somewhere in the past, but whether your life is a life of faith.   The child of Abraham can say without insincerity, "I am crucified   with Christ, it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in   me, and the life I now live in the flesh  I live by faith  in   the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me." We are   children of Abraham if we  live  by faith in the promises of   God summed up in Christ.              I end with an illustration. Picture heaven   as Orchestra Hall and the music of the symphony as the glory of   God. Everybody here knows that faith is the precondition for   entering that hall and enjoying that music. But some of you, I   fear, have gotten the notion that trusting in Christ is like   buying a ticket to Orchestra Hall once for all, and that you can   put this ticket away in your pocket as the guarantee of your   admission someday, even though the affections of your life are   captured by the music of this world. That is not a Biblical view   of saving faith. It's a delusion.              Faith is a precondition for enjoying the   symphony of God's glory not in the sense of getting a ticket but   in the sense of getting an ear for heaven's music. The real   precondition of enjoying the music of heaven throughout eternity   is a new heart which delights in the things of God, not a decision   card which you carry in your pocket to ease your conscience while   your mind is captivated by the delights of this   world.
