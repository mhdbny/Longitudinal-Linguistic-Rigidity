  March 23, 1986 Bethlehem Baptist Church  Morning  Pastor John Piper  Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   CHRIST: THE LION AND THE LAMB  Revelation 5:1-10 And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scrollwritten within and on the back, sealed with seven seals; (2) and I saw astrong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scrolland break its seals?" (3) And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earthwas able to open the scroll or to look into it, (4) and I wept much thatno one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. (5) Then oneof the elders said to me, "Weep not; lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah,the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and itsseven seals." (6) And between the throne and the four living creatures andamong the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, withseven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sentout into all the earth; (7) and he went and took the scroll from the righthand of him who was seated on the throne. (8)And when he had taken the scroll,the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before theLamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which arethe prayers of the saints; (9) and they sang a new song, saying, "Worthyart thou to take the scroll and to open its seals, for thou was slain andby thy blood didst ransom men for God from every tribe and tongue and peopleand nation, (10) and hast made them a kingdom and priests to our God, andthey shall reign on earth."   Noel and I have discussed often over the years what makes a truly admirable  woman and a truly admirable man. One of the conclusions we have come to is  that no man is truly admirable who does not have a measure of the more feminine  qualities, and no woman is truly admirable who does not have a measure of  the more masculine qualities.     A woman who acts too much like a man we regard as unnatural. We may pity  her or even be offended by her, but we don't admire her. And a man who acts  too much like a woman we regard as unnatural. We may pity him or even be  offended by him, but we don't admire him.     But neither do we admire the man who is typically called "all man" or the  woman who is typically called "all woman." Both of those phrases usually  suggest a man or a woman who is too narrow and too simple. They don`t have  the complexity and harmony of personality that makes a person rise in our  admiration. These phrases make us think of people who are only able to respond  with one kind of response and feel one kind of feeling and think one kind  of thought.     To admire that is like saying that a male chorus would be more male if they  all sang bass. And a women's chorus would be more female if they all sang  soprano. Well, that may be true, but they wouldn't be the better for it.     There is a real difference between a male chorus and a female chorus, just  like there is a difference between an admirable man and an admirable woman.  But what makes the male chorus sound great is that some of the voices have  a more feminine quality. And what makes a women's chorus sound great is that  some of the voices have a more masculine quality.     People who know music know what the balance should be. And people who are  good judges of character know what balance and blend is admirable in a person  too. The highest and deepest and most admirable beauties in my life are not  simple things. They are complex.     The reason I mention this is not because I want to talk about the difference  between male and female today, but simply to illustrate a principle of beauty  or excellence or admirableness. I want you to think seriously today about  what makes a person truly beautiful or excellent or admirable or praiseworthy.  My goal is that you might come to see Jesus Christ as irresistably admirable  and excellent and praiseworthy, and that you would be drawn to love him and  trust him and and give your full allegiance to him.     The principle that I am trying to illustrate and that makes Christ stand  out as absolutely unique is this: beauty or excellence consists in the right  proportion of diverse qualities. For example:              we admire him for his glory, but even more because his glory is mingled with      humility;           we admire him for his transcendence, but even more because his transcendence      is accompanied by condescension;           we admire him for his uncompromising justice, but even more because it is      tempered with mercy;           we admire him for his majesty, but even more because it is a majesty in meekness;           we admire him because of his equality with God, but even more because as      God's equal he nevertheless has a deep reverence for God;           we admire him because of how worthy he was of all good, but even more because      this was accompanied by an amazing patience to suffer evil;           we admire him because of his sovereign dominion over the world, but even      more because this dominion was clothed with a spirit of obedience and submission;           we love the way he stumped the proud scribes with his wisdom, and we love      it even more because he could be simple enough to like children and spend      time with them;           and we admire him because he could still the storm, but even more because      he refused to use that power to strike the Samaritans with lightning and      he refused to use it to get himself down from the cross.        The list could go on and on. Do you see what I mean when I say that beauty  and excellency in person is not a simple thing? It is complex. It is a coming  together in one person of the perfect balance and proportion of extremely  diverse qualities. And that's what makes Jesus Christ so irresistably admirable  and excellent.     The human heart was made to stand in awe of ultimate excellence -- You were  made to admire Jesus Christ the Son of God -- Wonderful Counselor, Mighty  God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, King of kings and Lord of lords  -- and if your heart is not much taken up with him then you don't need to  look any farther to know the deepest source of your frustration.     A student once asked Bonaventure, the medieval Franciscan teacher, "Why don't  men love God more?" And he answered, "They don't love him because they don't  know him." That's the way I feel about Christ this morning. Surely, if I  can display for you just a flicker of the excellency of Christ today, you  will love him and trust him and follow him, no matter what it costs. That's  my prayer for you (and for you who read this manuscript!).     I begin with the text by directing your attention to Revelation 5:5. John  is receiving a vision of the throne room of heaven. "Then one of the elders  said to me, 'Weep not; lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David,  has conquered.'" So Jesus here is described as a Lion, an animal who makes  prey of others and who is strong and wild and majestic and dangerous. (See  the prophecy in Genesis 49:9-10.)     But then in verse 6 John is allowed to see this Lion. But what he sees must  have been a surprise after the words of the elder in verse 5. It says, "And  between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I  saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain." So the Lion is a Lamb,  an animal that is easily preyed upon and that is weak and harmless and lowly,  sheared for our clothes and killed for our food.     So here is the point that I want to make this morning:     Because Jesus is a Lion-like Lamb and a Lamb-like Lion he has the right to  bring the world to an end for the glory of his name and the good of his people.     To see how this truth comes out of the text let's make three preliminary  observations.     1. The first is that God has absolute control of all future history and  everything that happens in it.     This is the point of verse 1: "And I saw in the right hand of him who was  seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with  seven seals."     What is this scroll with its writing on both sides and its seven seals? The  scroll represents the decrees of God concerning what will happen in the future.  You can see this in chapter six as one seal after the other is opened and  more and more is revealed of the judgments coming on the earth.     Opening the first seal in 6:1-2 reveals the rider of a white horse going  out to conquer, and probably represents the advance of the gospel in fulfillment  of the great commission. Opening the second seal in verses 3-4 reveal a red  horse signifying how in the days leading up to the end of the world men would  slay one another with the sword. The opening of the third and fourth seals  point to famine and other judgments. And so on it goes as Christ opens the  seals of the scroll and displays for John what was going to happen in the  future. The one who opens the seals reveals and executes the decrees of God.     So the scroll contains God's plans for the future: the struggles and victories  of the gospel as well as the judgments on those who reject it. The opening  of the seals is the course of history leading up to the end. And the rest  of the scroll is the story of the end of the world and the final triumph  of God's kingdom.     Now notice that the scroll is in the right hand of God. Verse 1: "And I saw  in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll." God holds  all of the future in his right hand. He wrote the script for what will take  place and no one can change it. He has it in his own right hand. If the kingdom  of Christ finally conquers and judgment finally falls on the unbelieving  world, it will be because God holds all things firmly in his right hand.     Then notice that he is called one "who was seated on the throne." This simply  confirms that he rules in the universe. His throne represents his right and  authority and power to govern the world the way he sees fit.     The completeness of his rule and the perfection of his decrees is signified  by the fact that the scroll is written within and on the back. In other words,  the scroll is packed. There are no spaces for later additions, as though  the King of the universe could overlook some eventuality. The plan is complete,  it is full, it is safe in the right hand of the King, and he is on the throne.     What we learn from this is that we ought submit to the authority of our King,  our Creator (4:11) and the Ruler of all things. A picture of God's sovereign  rule over all that will happen should bring us to our faces in reverence  and fear.     That's the first preliminary observation.     2. The second observation is that no creature in the universe is worthy to  reveal and execute the final decrees of God.     Verses 2-3: "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 'Who  is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?' And no one in heaven or  on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it."     Why doesn't God himself simply remove the seals of the scroll of history  and reveal its contents and bring about the consummation of his kingdom?  We will see the answer in just a moment when we read why Christ was qualified  to open the seals. But in advance the answer is that the end of history,  contained in this scroll, is going to bring such astounding privileges and  happiness to repentant sinners who deserve only condemnation that God would  be unrighteousness to bring it to pass by himself.     It would look as though he didn't care that we have trampled his glory in  the dirt. It would look as though he could just sweep our sin under the rug  of the universe. Something must be done to demonstrate the righteousness  of God if the opening of this scroll is going to bring infinite blessing  upon repentant sinners who deserve only condemnation. If God were to open  the scroll himself without any mediator, without any go-between, and deal  directly with sinful man, we would all be consumed and there would be no  salvation at all.     Someone must be found who is worthy to take the scroll and open it. And the  point of verses 2-3 is that there is no creature in all the universe who  can do it. No angel in heaven, no man on earth, no devil in hell can touch  this scroll and do what needs to be done to bring the consummation of the  kingdom.     So the lessons we learn from this second observation could be many. I'll  just mention two!     First, that God is a God of love because he will not open the seals of history  without the hands of a Savior.     Second, that no one -- not your friend or spouse or parent or child or boss  or teacher -- no one but Jesus can make your future bright. Without him all  is meaningless and fearful.     3. Which leads us very briefly to the third observation from verse 4: "And  I wept much that no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into  it." The third observation is that without Christ there will be only weeping.     If there is no one found who is worthy to open the scroll, then there will  be no triumph for the gospel, no marriage supper with the Lamb, no new heaven  and new earth, no eternal life. Only weeping.     Therefore Jesus Christ is utterly necessary for every one of us. He alone  is worthy to open the seals and execute the final decrees of God.     That brings us to verses 5 and 6 and the main point where we began:     Because Jesus is a Lion-like Lamb and a Lamb-like Lion he has the right to  bring the world to an end for the glory of his name and the good of his people.     Now let's read verse 5 again in the light of the three observations we have  made. "Then one of the elders said to me, 'Weep not; lo, the Lion of the  tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the  scroll and its seven seals.'" There is one person who can open the scroll,  namely the Lion of Judah. And the reason that he is worthy to open the scroll  is that he has conquered.     But what does this conquering refer to? We can see that clearly in verse  9. Here the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fall down and  worship the Lamb, and they sang a new song, saying,                 Worthy art thou to take the scroll           and to open its seals,           for thou wast slain and by thy blood           didst ransom men for God           from every tribe and tongue           and people and nation,           and hast make them a kingdom           and priests to our God           and they shall reign on earth.             Now notice carefully the relationship between verse 5 and verse 9. In verse  5 the reason the Lion of Judah can open the scroll is that he has conquered.  In verse 9 the reason he can open the scroll is because he was slain and  by his blood ransomed men for God.     In other words, his right to open the scroll is owing to the fact that he  ransomed people for God by his death, and this ransoming was the victory  referred to in verse 5.     What sort of Lion was he? He was a Lamb-like Lion. The Lion of Judah conquered  because he was willing to act the part of a Lamb. He came into Jerusalem  on Palm Sunday like a King on the way to a throne, and he went out of Jerusalem  on Good Friday like a Lamb on the way to the slaughter. He drove out the  robbers from the Temple like a Lion devouring its prey. And then at the end  of the week he gave his majestic neck to the knife, and they slaughtered  the Lion of Judah like a Lamb. So he conquered sin and death and Satan not  just because he was a Lion, but because he was a Lamb-like Lion.     It was one of those classic tactical defeats that results in a strategic  victory. Jonathan Edwards captures the paradox of a victorious loser with  another familiar comparison.     The devil had, as it were, swallowed up Christ, as the whale did Jonah; but  it was deadly poison to him; he gave him a mortal wound in his own bowels.  He was soon sick of his morsel, and was forced to do by him as the whale  did by Jonah. To this day he is heart-sick of what he then swallowed as his  prey. (Works I, 685)     The Lion gets the victory through the tactics of the Lamb.     You could use another Old Testament comparison to show the same thing, namely,  Samson.     And thus the true Samson does more towards the destruction of his enemies  at his death than in his life; in yielding up himself to death, he pulls  down the temple of Dagon, and destroys many thousands of his enemies, even  while they are making themselves sport in his sufferings. (Edwards, Works  I, 685)     The Lion Samson gets the decisive victory when he takes the roll of the  sacrificial Lamb and dies.     So it is with Christ. The Lion of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered  sin (Hebrews 1:3; 1 Corinthians 15:56) and death (2 Timothy 1:10; 1 Corinthians  15:25f, 56) and Satan (Hebrews 2:14f; Colossians 2:15). And he did it when  he took the roll of a Lamb and died.     But not only is he a Lamb-like Lion. He is also a Lion-like Lamb. Verse 6:  "And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders,  I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns..."     Notice two things. First, notice that the Lamb is standing. It is not slumped  in a heap on the ground as it once was. It had been slain. But now it is  standing -- standing in the innermost circle next to the throne.     Second, notice that the Lamb has seven horns. A horn is a symbol of strength  and power throughout the book of Revelation (12:3; 13:1; 17:3, 12) as well  as in the OT (Deuteronomy 33:17; Psalm 18:2; 112:7). And the number seven  signifies fullness and completeness.     So this is no ordinary Lamb. He is a Lion-like Lamb. Look at 6:16 where men  call to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of  him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb." And look  at 17:14 where the final enemies of God fight against Christ: "they will  make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords  and King of kings."     In other words, he is a Lion-like Lamb.     So I conclude by stressing the main point: since Jesus is not merely a simple  thing like a lion or like a lamb, but is a Lion-like Lamb and a Lamb-like  Lion, therefore he is admirable and excellent and worthy to take the scroll  and open its seals and bring this world to an end for the glory of his name  and the good of his ransomed people.     And you can be among that number if you trust him as your Lamb, and submit  to him as your Lion, and join the four living creatures and the twenty-four  elders and the the millions of angels to worship the King of kings with all  your heart.
