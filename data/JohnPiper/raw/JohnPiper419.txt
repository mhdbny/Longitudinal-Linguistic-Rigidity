  October 16, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       GOD IN EVERYTHING AT THE END OF THE AGE    (1 Peter 4:7-11)        The end of all things is at hand;therefore be of      sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.      Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because      love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another      without complaint. As each one has received a special gift,      employ it in serving one another, as good stewards of the      manifold grace of God. Whoever speaks, let him speak, as it      were, the utterances of God; whoever serves, let him do so as      by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God      may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the      glory and dominion forever and ever.Amen.         I have preached on this text at least three times since I have   been at Bethlehem. Once I focused on the call to prayer in verse   7. Once I focussed on the call to love and hospitality in verses   8-9. Once I focussed on spiritual gifts in verse 10. And I think   there was a fourth time when I focussed on how to serve God so   that God gets the glory from verse 11.       So as I was praying about what to focus on this time, it seemed   like I should focus on something I have not before. Two things   seemed timely. One was the phrase, "The end of all things is at   hand," in verse 7. The other was a special word I think the Lord   has for us as a church at this specific juncture of our life   together -- coming through hard days and entering into a time of   master planning.       So that's what I want to try to do this morning. I want to   explain what I think Peter means by "The end of all things is at   hand," (in verse 7) and then draw out a word for us that I believe   the Lord impressed on me fairly strongly yesterday.       The End of all things is at hand: What Did Peter Mean?       Let's begin with verse 7. Peter starts the paragraph, "The end   of all things is at hand." What does he mean? Was he claiming to   know and teach that Jesus would come back in a few months or years   and end this age and establish the kingdom -- so that he made a   mistake in his prediction? Or was he teaching that Jesus could   come back at any moment because everything that needs to happen   before he comes had happened -- and so his coming is near in the   sense of being immanent? Or is there a third possibility?       Interpreters with less confidence in the Scriptures have   sometimes concluded that the apostles simply made a mistake when   they said things like this -- "the end of all things at hand." The   end is near, they said, but the end was over two thousand years   away. So they made a mistake -- the argument goes.       But for those of us who have come to trust in Scripture as   God's word and believe that God did not allow his apostles to   teach mistakes to the church, this is not so easy. And there are   other reasons it's not so easy. One is that Peter was there in   Acts 1:6 when the apostles ask Jesus if Now is the time for the   kingdom to be established. "Lord, is it at this time that you are   restoring the kingdom to Israel?" Peter heard Jesus say, "It is   not for you to know the times or epochs which the Father has fixed   by his own authority" (Acts 1:7). Peter had been told that it was   not his business to know when Jesus would come and establish his   kingdom. His business was to do the Master's bidding till he comes   -- to spread the gospel to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the   ends of the earth.       So what was Peter teaching about the end of all things in verse   7? The clue that I followed was the following word on prayer,   "Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose   of prayer." Peter connects the nearness of the end with the need   for prayer. I think this points us back to the teaching of Jesus   who did the same thing in Luke 21:36.       I invite you to look it up with me, so we can see it in   context: "But keep on the alert at all times, praying in order   that you may have strength to escape all these things that are   about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man." The   point of praying for "escape" is not that Christians will be taken   out of the world and not pass through the trouble Jesus is   predicting. You don't need "strength" for that. He prays for   "strength" -- that they would be strong so as not to be   spiritually and morally ruined by the end-time stresses. Two   verses later in verse 34 he calls the coming end a "trap" for   those who are weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and   the worries of life. That's what we need to have strength to   escape from -- the trap of worldliness as the end draws near.       So both Jesus and Peter connect the urgency of prayer with the   drawing near of the end of the age. Peter was there when Jesus   taught this and learned it from him. So let's stay with the   context in Luke 21 for a few minutes and see how Jesus taught   Peter and the others to think about the end of the age.       In verse 6 of Luke 21 Jesus predicts the demolishing of the   Jerusalem temple: "not one stone will be left upon another." This   prompts the disciples to ask (in v. 7) about the signs when these   kinds of things would happen.       So Jesus mentions some things that are going to happen leading   from then to the end. Verse 9: "And when you hear of wars and   disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take   place first, but the end does not follow immediately." Notice:   Jesus is careful to say that these signs -- wars and disturbances   -- are not immediately followed by the end. There is an undefined   space of time. He is avoiding locking himself into a specific time   frame.       In verses 10 and 11 he mentions wars again, as well as   earthquakes and famines and terrors and some kind of cataclysmic   signs in the sky or in space. Then in verse 12 he says something   important about timing. Looking back on the wars and upheavals and   famines and earthquakes, he says, "But before all these things,   they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you . . .   etc."       Notice the word, "before." So now you have another indefinite   space of time implied: First there is the persecution that Peter   and other disciples will experience (v. 12). Then there is "these   things" -- "before all these things" (v. 12) -- namely, the wars   and famines and earthquakes, etc. Then there is the end. And   between these there is no set amount of time.       Then Jesus adds some more signs that will happen on the way to   the end -- still without getting specific about when they happen   or how they are connected. For example, verse 20: "But when you   see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her   desolation is at hand." Then verse 24b: "Jerusalem will be   trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the   Gentiles be fulfilled." So the destruction of Jerusalem is part of   what is coming before the end, and after that there will be this   period of time, again of unspecified length, that has to be   fulfilled -- which Jesus calls "the times of the Gentiles."       Now when Peter wrote 1 Peter, Jerusalem had not been destroyed   yet. He died around A.D. 65 and Jerusalem was destroyed by the   Romans in about A.D. 70. So it's hard for me to agree with the   interpretation that says what Peter meant in 1 Peter 4:7 ("The end   of all things is at hand") was that Jesus could come back at any   moment. Jesus had said that Jerusalem would be destroyed first and   then an undefined time of the Gentiles would elapse before the end   of the age would come and he would return.       Besides the destruction of Jerusalem Jesus also said that world   evangelization would take place before the end would come. For   example, Matthew 24:14, "This gospel of the kingdom must first be   preached in all the world as a testimony to all the nations; then   the end will come" (cf. Acts 1:8).       And not only that Jesus had told Peter what would happen in his   old age, and so he predicted that Peter would get old. In John   21:18 Jesus said, "When you grow old you will stretch out your   hands and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do   not wish to go." So Peter can't have believed that Jesus would   return at any minute during his middle aged years of ministry. The   Lord himself had told him how he would die when he was old.       And Paul warns against this view that Jesus might have returned   in those days at any moment. Paul says, to the Thessalonians,   "&#91;The day of the Lord&#93; will not come first unless the   apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed" (2   Thess. 2:3). So he explicitly checks the spread of the view in his   day that the Day of the Lord could have already come. He says   there are things that yet have to happen before the day of the   Lord can come.       The End of All Things is at Hand: An Interpretation       My suggestion then is that Peter means something like this when   he says, "The end of all things is at hand":       All around us there is intensifying persecution, as the Lord   said there would be. There are rumors of wars. The horizon is dark   for Israel, and the judgment on Jerusalem is near.       Not only that, the gospel is spreading like wildfire as the   Spirit is poured out. Paul was able to plant churches in all the   major cites of Galatia in a matter of months. Now he has completed   the frontier mission work from Jerusalem all the way around to   northern Italy (Rom. 15:19), and he plans to go to Spain.   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of other bands of missionaries are   forming and going to the unreached.       I don't know how big the world is. But if Pentecost is any   indication, and if the success of Paul is any evidence, the world   could be evangelized in not many years by God's great power.   Brothers the end is near -- I'm not predicting when it will   happen. I mean, the things that the Lord said must happen before   he comes are taking place around us, and could be accomplished   quickly -- even in your lifetime.       So be sober for prayer, because the great danger facing us is   that we fall in love with this world and become spiritually dull   and the day come upon us like a thief and we be destroyed. O pray,   brothers, pray for the coming of the kingdom and for your strength   to endure and escape the trap of spiritual apathy. Pray that you   may be able to stand before the Son of Man.       And that's exactly the way I would talk about the coming of the   Lord today. It is just around the corner. The end is near indeed.   If anyone dallies with sin and the world, thinking, "I have lots   of time," he plays the fool. The Judge is at the door. And the   time remaining should be spent in earnest prayer that we not be   made drunk and hard by the cares and pleasures of this world.       This weighed on me all the way home yesterday from Brazil. I   saw all those people in the Sao Paulo airport and the Miami   airport and the Chicago airport and the Minneapolis airport --   thousands and thousands of people who don't believe that the end   is near. Or that there even is a Lord of history that is guiding   it all to an appointed end of judgment and salvation. I felt more   ache for the lost than I had for a long time. May the Lord stir us   up to warn as many people as we can -- earnestly, lovingly,   boldly.       That's a word from the Lord for us this morning. And there is   one more -- at least. Maybe you will hear something from this text   that I don't even see.       A Word for Bethlehem       The other word for us comes from verses 8 and 9 about how to   live together in the end time stresses. "Above all, keep fervent   in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of   sins. 9 Be hospitable to one another without complaint   &#91;without grumbling&#93;." I saw a connection between verses 8   and 9 that I hadn't seen before. And it made me think of where we   are as a church.       Verse 8 says that our love needs to be the kind that covers   each others sins. In other words the focus is on the effect of   love that enables fellowship in spite of sins. Isn't that   remarkable?       Then in verse 9 Peter says that we should be hospitable   "without complaint" or without grumbling. Grumbling about what?   Maybe about the time and effort it takes to fix a meal or   straighten the house. But don't you think he means grumbling about   people. Love covers over sins. Let hospitality be without   grumbling. Love says, "I'm just going to cover the things about   which I could complain and grumble.       The Lord is ministering to us here. He's choosing the texts as   we move through 1 Peter. If we want to, we all have ample reason   to complain and murmur, don't we? Some feel that there are past   sins in the way Dean and Leah were disciplined. Others feel there   are past sins in the way the elders were treated. Others feel   neither or both.       But God's amazing word to us this morning I believe is: love   covers sins, so that hospitality -- real heart-felt fellowship --   can happen, not because we even agree on what the sins are --   that's the amazing thing in this text -- not because we finally   decide what the real sins are, but because love covers them.       Peter is saying that bona fide, authentic love and fellowship   is based, in part, on the covering of many sins. This is not   sweeping things under the rug. It's not endorsing keeping   skeletons in the closet. It's not renouncing church discipline.   It's saying at least this -- probably more: When we've done all   the confrontation -- when we've done all the argumentation and   exhortation -- we cover it. Whatever side we are on we cover it;   we give it up; we bury it as a cause of murmuring.       And then we turn together to God's future grace and take our   united cue for Master Planning from verse 11: we will so live   "that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to   whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
