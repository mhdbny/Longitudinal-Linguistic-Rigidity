  April 24, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WHO SHALL SHEPHERD THE FLOCK?    (1 Peter 5:1-4)        Therefore, I exhort the elders among you,as your      fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a      partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the      flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under      compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and      not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it      over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples      to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will      receive the unfading crown of glory.         Introduction: the Seriousness of Elder Accountability for the   Flock       Probably no issue has occupied more of the elders' time over   the past several years than the issue of how to provide pastoral   care and oversight to about 1100 people scattered all over the   Twin Cities. Verse 4 says that someday the "Chief Shepherd" is   going to appear and there will be a reckoning with the   under-shepherds, the elders. That is a sobering thing to those of   us in leadership.       We have become increasingly convicted by texts like Hebrews   13:17 that says to the church:       Your leaders (the elders) keep watch over your souls, as those   who will give an account &#91;namely, to God&#93;. Let them do   this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable   for you.       Or Acts 20:28 where Paul says to the elders of the church in   Ephesus:        Be on guard for yourselves and for allthe flock,      among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd      the church of God which He purchased with His ownblood.         You can hear the earnestness and the seriousness in those   words: you elders shepherd the people "whom God purchased with his   own blood." In other words, don't take this work lightly. Don't be   casual and cavalier and breezy about this responsibility.       Emerging Vision of "Pastoral Care Elders" at Bethlehem       The fruit of all our study and prayer and work is an emerging   vision of a district pastoral care eldership teamed up with   district deacons and small group leaders who together will   shepherd the flock of God called Bethlehem, and give an account of   each member before the Lord.       The aim is to build a people, through the word of God and   prayer and all kinds of practical caring ministries in the   districts, who in their hearts have a vision of a great, glorious,   sovereign, gracious, wise, all-sufficient, all-satisfying God; and   who savor that vision of God in worship, strengthen that vision of   God in mutual encouragement and care, and spread that vision of   God in works of love, local evangelism and world missions.       Tom Steller will say more about the details of the pastoral   care elders in a few minutes.       Biblical Context for Elder Accountability       What I want to do is put the vision in a Biblical context from   1 Peter 5, that proved to be far more relevant to our situation   when I began to study it than I thought it was going to be.       The text begins in chapter five: "Therefore, I exhort the   elders among you." If we ask, "Why did Peter feel the need to   exhort the elders here at the end of his letter?" we get a clue to   the answer in the word "therefore". Something is happening . . .   "Therefore, I exhort the elders." (Again I build half my message   on a word that the NIV simply chooses to drop!!! Look to the NASB   or RSV.)       What has been happening?       Peter has been warning the church about the "fiery ordeal that   is coming upon them for their testing" (4:12). He says (in 4:13)   that the Christians may share the sufferings of Christ for a   season and then exult in the glory of Christ when he comes. This   is what Peter says about himself in 5:1 when he calls himself a   fellow elder with the elders he's writing to. He says he is a   witness to Christ's sufferings and a sharer in the coming glory.   This alerts us that this "fiery ordeal" (4:12) probably has   something to do with the elders in chapter five.       







Judgment Begins   with the Elders       This gets even clearer in 4:17. Peter explains why this "fiery   trial" is coming on the church. He says (v. 17), "For it is time   for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins   with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey   the gospel of God? (18) And if it is with difficulty that the   righteous is saved, what will become of the godless man and the   sinner?"       These verses have to do with the whole church. The fiery ordeal   that comes as punishing condemnation on unbelievers, hits the   church first as fires of purification and refining (cf. 1:7).       But what about the elders? Is there anything special for them   in this? There are two Old Testament background texts that suggest   there is. One is Ezekiel 9. God's own people have committed   abominations and God resolves to judge his own city. God says to   his angel (v. 4),        "Go through the midst of the city, eventhrough the      midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men      who sigh and groan over all the abominations which are being      committed in its midst." (Like blood on the doorpost at the      Passover.) 5 But to the others He said in my hearing, "Go      through the city after him and strike; do not let your eye have      pity, and do not spare. 6 Utterly slay old men, young men,      maidens, little children, and women, but do not touch any man      on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My sanctuary      (same idea and words as here in 1 Peter 4:17)." So they started      with the elders who were before thetemple.         So if Peter has in his mind the way God once began his judgment   from the house of God -- especially from the elders -- he may well   see a special need to exhort the elders in view of the fiery   ordeal that is coming.       The other background text is Malachi 3:1-3 where God says that   his messenger is going to come to his temple -- to his house or   his people as Peter says in 2:5):        2 But who can endure the day of Hiscoming? And who      can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and      like fullers' soap. 3 . . . He will purify the sons of Levi and      refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to      the Lord offerings in righteousness.         The "sons of Levi" are the priests. Now it's true that in 1   Peter 2:5,9 all believers are priests. But it is not easy for a   leader to read this and fail to see that the refining fire of   judgment has a special reference to leaders. The fire purifies the   leaders first.       So when Peter says in 4:17, "It is time for judgment to begin   with the household of God," it is easy to see why he would say in   5:1, "THEREFORE, I exhort the elders among you . . ."       So my answer to the question, "Why does Peter feel the need to   exhort the elders?" is that this "fiery ordeal" in 4:12 is a   judgment from God that begins with the house of God -- and in the   house of God begins with the elders, the leaders.       It is an fearful and wonderful thing to be an elder in the   house of God. If the elders lead the church into strength and   glory they will also lead the church into the refiners fire of   God's purifying judgment. They will not stand above the church or   outside the church giving suggestions for how to cope with fire;   they will lead the church into the fire.       So when Peter calls himself in verse one a "fellow elder" it's   not that he is laying claim to an exalted title (he could have   called himself an apostle!); he's expressing a willingness to   suffer in the refiner's fire along with the rest of the elders. In   fact I think this is what he means when he calls himself in v. 1b   a "witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the   glory that is to be revealed." I think "witness" here means more   than, "I was there and I saw them." I think he means, "I bear   witness to them by my words and by my life. I am with you in the   struggle. I am with you in the fire that purifies and refines the   elders of God's people."       In other words he is practicing what he preaches in verse 3 --   that elders lead by example not by lording it over the flock.       So Peter believes that the elders need a special exhortation   here at the end of his letter. Fire is painful; judgment is   serious. It is coming on the house of God; and on the elders   first. In this situation elders need warning and they need hope.   Peter gives both.       Three Warnings for Elders       Three warnings. Warnings against three typical failures in the   eldership. A warning against laziness; a warning against greed;   and a warning against pride. The lust for ease, the lust for   money, and the lust for power and prestige.       First, a warning against laziness -- the lust for leisure and   comfort and ease. Verse 2: "Shepherd the flock of God among you,   exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily,   according to the will of God."       He warns them against drifting into a lazy or distracted   pattern of ministry that requires some kind of external   "compulsion" to overcome. Don't be sluggish and unconcerned. Don't   be like the mule that has to have a bit and bridle. Be willing.       Or it might be that it's fear he is warning against here and   not laziness. It might be fear that makes an elder unwilling to   serve. Don't be fearful of doing what you are called to do. Do it   voluntarily.       This is why we do not want to pressure anyone into the   eldership at Bethlehem. God wants men who want the ministry, not   those who act out of external compulsion.       Second, Peter warns the elders against greed -- the lust for   money. Verse 2c: "&#91;Shepherd the flock . . . not for sordid   gain, but with eagerness." This would apply especially to us who   make our living in the ministry. Do not begin to look on your   eldership merely as a means of making a living. Watch out for the   temptation to make "godliness a means of gain" as Paul said in 1   Timothy 6:5.       Rather do your ministry with "eagerness." That is love your   work. Find joy in your work. Remember, as Paul said to the   Ephesian elders in Acts 20:35, "It is more blessed to give than to   receive." And remember what Hebrews 13:17 says, "Let &#91;the   elders minister&#93; with joy and not with grief, for this would   be unprofitable for you."       Third, Peter warns the elders against pride -- the lust for   power and prestige. Verse 3: "&#91;Shepherd the flock . . . not   yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving   to be examples to the flock." Pride is the failure to realize   deeply that without Christ we can do nothing. And so the proud   heart starts to feel that it can be self-reliant. And then it   begins to feel that it is indispensable. And then it starts to act   that way and exalt itself and seek the praise of men.       But Peter says to the elders, don't exalt yourselves like that;   lead -- you must lead (as v. 5 implies) -- but lead with servant   lowliness; lead by example.       When the fiery trial comes to you first, lead by example. You   don't escape it or run from it. You walk through it with the   sheep.       Those are the warnings we need. A warning against living for   ease; a warning against living for money; and a warning against   living for power and prestige and praise.       Hope for Elders       But in this fiery situation elders also need hope. This is what   Peter gives them in verse 4: "And when the Chief Shepherd appears,   you will receive the unfading crown of glory."       Yesterday in the seminar on the urban poor Viv Grigg referred   to the words of Jesus in Luke 14:13-14 about ministry to the poor.   Jesus holds out the same kind of hope Peter does here:       When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame,   the blind, and you will be blessed, since they do not have the   means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of   the righteous.       In other words there are ministries we should do that may be   thankless in this world. If we need a lot of strokes, we will   probably not do what Jesus calls us to do. It's too hard and   there's not enough reward here and now.       But if we really believe that we will be repaid at the   resurrection of the righteous, if we elders really believe that   "when the Chief Shepherd appears he will give us the unfading   crown of glory", then we will have motivation and strength to do   what he calls us to do.       There may be times when our elders feel like the refining fire   is too hot. We may feel that, if it takes this much fire to burn   away our sloth and our greed and our pride, then it's not worth   it. But that would be because we have taken our eyes off eternity,   and off the all-satisfying Chief-Shepherd, our Lord Jesus.       Tom Steller is going to come and say a word about the pastoral   care eldership at Bethlehem. My prayer as he comes is that God   would cause gifted and qualified men at Bethlehem to sense the   call of God on your life. There is a great work to do. A great   fiery battle to be fought. And a great reward beyond all measure.       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
