 February 14, 1999    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       THE EFFECT OF HYPOCRISY: DISHONORING GOD    Part Two    (Romans 2:17-24)        But if you bear the name "Jew" and rely upon the Law and boast   in God, 18 and know His will and approve the things that are   essential, being instructed out of the Law, 19 and are confident   that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who   are in darkness, 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the   immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the   truth, 21 you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach   yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?   22 You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit   adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 23 You who   boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor   God? 24 For "THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES   BECAUSE OF YOU," just as it is written.        Why Dwell on Sinfulness?        It may seem strange to us that Paul would devote several   chapters to demonstrating the sinfulness of all people. We might   think that he should get to the good news and camp there and help   people see the good news as really good. That would feel more   positive than lingering as long as he does over the sinfulness of   Gentiles and Jews - that is, all of us.        But there are probably some very profound reasons for this   lingering over the sinfulness of Gentiles and Jews. I think of two   at least. One is that the gospel of justification by grace alone   through faith alone simply does not land on us as overwhelmingly   good news until we have some deeper sense of our sinfulness and   hopelessness before God. The other reason Paul may draw out his   demonstration of our sinfulness is that we are so resistant to   seeing it and feeling it.        I think we can sense this behind today's text. Let me   illustrate the point from an article I just read this week about   the careless intermingling of a therapeutic worldview with a   Biblical worldview. One difference between these worldviews is   that one assumes that our problems should be framed mainly in   terms of mental health and therapeutic treatment, while the other   assumes that our problems should be framed mainly in terms of sin   and righteousness and redemption through faith in Christ and his   Word. The name of the article is "Faith and Therapy" and it is by   William Kilpatrick, a professor in the Education Department at   Boston College.        He wrote:        One of the most destructive consequences of carelessly mixing   therapy with faith is a diminished sense of sin. The best evidence   that this has already happened in the Catholic Church is the   tremendous drop-off in the practice of confession of the last   thirty years. When we couple this with the nearly 100 percent   communion turnout in most parishes, we have to conclude that most   parishioners don't have a strong consciousness of sin. They seem   to have been so schooled in the gospel of self-acceptance that   they can't think of any sins they need to confess.        A colleague at Boston College told me a story that reinforces   the point. He once asked members of his philosophy class to write   an anonymous essay about a personal struggle over right and wrong,   good and evil. Most of the students, however, were unable to   complete the assignment. "Why?" he asked. "Well," they said - and   apparently this was said without irony - "We haven't done anything   wrong." We can see a lot of self-esteem here, but little   self-awareness - the absence of a sense of sin seems strange when   one considers that most of these students have had years of   Catholic schooling. (First Things, Feb. 1999, no. 90, p. 23)        Don't jump to the conclusion that this is an isolated Catholic   phenomenon. The article documents the kinds of teaching in both   Catholic and Protestant evangelical children's and youth curricula   that lead to this kind of thing.        We Are Resistant to Recognizing Our Sin        My point is simply this: one of the reasons Paul dwells on the   demonstration of sinfulness in Romans 1-3 is that we are so   resistant to seeing it and feeling it. We find ways of avoiding   the issue and softening the indictments and escaping the evidences   of our sinfulness. And there are endless ways, it seems, to admit   to a little bit of it, while not being broken and humbled by it.   But brokenness and humility are the gateway to paradise, and   indeed they are the road to paradise. In this life, we never   outgrow our need for ever-new experiences of brokenness and   humility because of our sinfulness.        Now, Paul realizes the resistance and obstacles that he is up   against in Romans as he tries to help his readers see the depth   and universality of sin. Remember, he is aiming at Romans 3:9,   "What then? Are we &#91;Jews&#93; better than they   &#91;Gentiles&#93;? Not at all; for we have already charged that   both Jews and Greeks are all under sin." This has been his aim in   chapters 1 and 2 - to show that both Jews and Gentiles are "under   sin." That is, under the dominion of sin, in the grip and power of   sin, apart from the gospel of Christ. His aim in all this painful   diagnosis of the disease of sin is to make the world aware of its   need for the gospel of justification by grace through faith, and   the wonderful way it fits our condition and meets our need for   forgiveness and righteousness.        In today's text, Paul deals with a form of resistance that is   common among those of us who are religious and who believe in the   Bible as God's word and who even have responsibilities to preach   or teach. The resistance is the assumption that, having so much   revelation and so much knowledge and so much truth, our business   is to set each other right rather than to repent ourselves. This   is a huge danger.        Correcting Others or Repenting?        Let's set it before ourselves the way Paul does. In Romans   2:17-24, he paints a remarkable picture of privileges of the   Jewish nation in having the Law of God in their Scriptures. I   don't think he is entirely negative here. He is a Jew and counts   this a tremendous privilege. You can see this in Romans 3:1-2,   "Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of   circumcision? Great in every respect. First of all, that they were   entrusted with the oracles of God." This is a great advantage, if   the Jews understand these oracles and apply them to their lives   and trust in the God they reveal and do them the way God intended.   So when we read Romans 2:17ff, we must not think that these are   all bad distinctives here.        Notice that after saying that they bear the name "Jew," he   gives two lists of four claims that Jewish people were making, and   shows after each of these that they are both rooted in the Law.   Here's the first list of four: verses 17b-18, (1) "&#91;you&#93;   rely upon the Law and (2) boast in God, and (3) know His will and   (4) approve the things that are essential." Then Paul gives the   basis of these four claims that they made (verse 18b) - "being   instructed out of the Law." In other words, since you are   instructed out of the Law, therefore you do these four things:   "(1) rely on the Law, (2) boast in God, (3) know his will, and (4)   approve the things that are essential." All these are traced back   to the privilege of "being instructed in the Law."        These Jews are people of the book. And Paul agrees with that.   But there is clearly something wrong. And we, who are Christian   people of the book, should be all ears and on the edge of our   seats to find out what went wrong, lest we make the same mistake.   There is nothing wrong, in themselves, with relying on the   trustworthiness of God's law or boasting in God or knowing his   will or approving things essential. But evidently there is a way   that all that can go wrong. All of that good use of the Law can be   a part of what shows a person to be a sinner.        Take the next unit of four claims. Verses 19-20, (1)   "&#91;You&#93; are confident that you yourself are a guide to the   blind, (2) a light to those who are in darkness, (3) a corrector   of the foolish, (4) a teacher of the immature." Then, again Paul   names the basis of these four claims, namely, "having in the Law   the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth." In other words,   "Because you have in the Law the form or the embodiment of   knowledge and truth (which I think Paul would agree with),   therefore you claim to be (1) a guide to the blind, (2) a light in   the darkness, (3) a corrector the foolish, (4) a teacher of the   immature." All this is possible, Paul says, because "you have in   the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth."        Notice the difference between these two groups of four claims.   The first group in verses 17-18 simply describes the Jews' own   experience with the Law, not how it affects the way they relate to   others. They rest in it and boast in God and know his will and   recognize excellent things. But in the second group (verses   19-20), the entire focus is on what the Jews do with all this in   relation to others: they guide and shine and correct and teach. So   the second group goes beyond the first: the first says we have the   light; the second says we shine the light.        You Who Teach Others, Don't You Teach Yourselves?        Now that is not bad in itself. If you have light, you ought to   shine the light. And the Law was a precious gift from God to   Israel and she should have shone the light of it to the nations.   If Paul were criticizing that, someone could say, "Well, Paul, you   are doing the same thing. You are claiming to know God and have   his Word and preach it for others to see and believe." It's not a   sinful thing to have the Word of God and be enlightened by the   Word of God and teach the Word of God.        So what's the problem? The problem is seen in verse 21a, "You,   therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself?" The   "therefore" means, I think, "Now it seems that, given all these   amazing advantages you have within the Law of God - it seems that   therefore you would teach yourselves. But you don't." His question   expects a negative answer. We know that from verses 23 and 24. You   have all this revelation and all this light and all this knowledge   and all this truth and you don't get it. You teach a form of it to   others but you don't go to the heart of it and the root of it. You   just don't get what the Law is really about.        I think that's what Paul means in verse 21a: "You, therefore,   who teach others, you just don't teach yourselves." And the upshot   of this is that the Law itself becomes a means of boasting, not a   means of love. Love uses truth to bless others; but sin uses truth   to exalt self. Both use truth, both can use the Bible. But only   one is really taught by the truth and taught by the Bible.        Now Paul illustrates this failure to really be taught by the   Law. In verses 21b-22, he gives three examples of how their   failure to teach themselves expresses itself: "You who preach that   one shall not steal, do you steal? You who say that one should not   commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do   you rob temples?" Now what would Paul respond if his non-Christian   Jewish readers were to say, "No, we don't steal and commit   adultery and rob temples. Never have, never will"?        But We Don't Do Those Kinds of Sins, Paul!        I think Paul would - or could - answer at three levels. First,   I think he could say, "I know that not every Jewish person does   these very acts externally. But some do, even though they have the   Law and all the advantages listed. So what I am saying is that   merely having the Law and being an instructor of others does not,   in itself, spare you from God's judgment if you don't live up to   it. Your boast of having the Law and teaching the Law is not   enough. There must be a doing of the Law."        Secondly, I think he could say, "Yes, I know that not all   Jewish people do these acts externally, but do you do anything   like them? These are illustrative of all that the law demands. Do   you keep the whole law? Are you without sin? Does not your sin,   even if different from these, put you in need of a Savior? Are you   not under the power of sin, even though you have the Law and teach   others?        Thirdly, and most importantly, I think Paul could say, "Yes,   you really do steal and commit adultery and rob temples." "How   so?" you ask. Because you do not understand what the Law most   essentially demands, namely, faith. Faith in God for his gracious   gift of forgiveness, and a right standing with him, and the   enablement to obey his commandments. But instead, you use the law   to establish your own righteousness and thus rob God of the most   basic thing he demands from you, humble trust in him for his   mercy. And what is this but adultery as you give your heart and   trust - that belong only to God - to another? And what is this   spiritual adultery except the taking of the very idols of the   world and making them your own - as if to rob their temples   because God himself is not good enough for you. And do not the   nations then blaspheme God, if you take their values, but call   yourselves the people of God?        Where does this interpretation come from? First, from Romans   9:30-32, "What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not   pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the   righteousness which is by faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of   righteousness, did not arrive at that law. Why? Because they did   not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works." What does   this teach? It teaches that Israel, while having the form or   embodiment of the Law, and while teaching others, did not teach   herself what the Law really meant. They did not get to the heart   and essence of the Law. The Law taught faith and a life of faith -   deeds done by faith. But Israel did not teach themselves these   things. They stayed at the level of external righteousness and did   not understand that all the commandments were a call to live by   faith in the all-supplying grace of God.        Robbing God        So they robbed God of the one main thing that the Law demanded,   faith. The one thing that honors and glorifies God (Romans 4:20),   they kept for themselves. They seemed to have knowledge of the Law   at one level, but they did not have knowledge of the Law at the   essential level. You see this again in Romans 10:1-3, "Brethren,   my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their   salvation. For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God,   but not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God's   righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not   subject themselves to the righteousness of God."        So they knew the Law of righteousness at one level, but not at   another. They took the commandments and made them into a means of   self-righteousness, instead of seeing them as the description of   the life of faith. So they robbed God of the faith and trust that   he demands; and in robbing God, they committed adultery by giving   their hearts and their faith to another (to themselves or   religious ritual or moral striving or the praise of men). And in   doing that, they embraced the same idols that the world embraces,   and thus plundered the temples of the world.        Now here is the warning and the gospel invitation - mainly for   me, but also for you. Let us be careful - O so watchful and   careful - all of us lovers of the Bible. Beware lest we rest in   the Word and boast in God and know his will and approve what is   excellent and guide the blind and correct the foolish and teach   the immature, but do not teach ourselves. Beware lest the Word   become a formal thing. An external thing.        If it does not break us, if it does not humble us, if it does   not lead us to a sweet, childlike trust in free grace - in other   words, if it does not lead us to the Gospel of justification by   grace, through faith in Christ - then we are not yet taught by the   Word of God, and are not fit to teach others. Woe to me and other   teachers and preachers - lovers of the Book - who have in the Word   of God the embodiment of knowledge and truth, but only know the   letter of the Law and not the Spirit - who only know the form of   righteousness and not the righteousness that comes by faith.        O that everyone in this room would be taught, even now, by the   Spirit, the difference between establishing our own righteousness   and receiving the righteousness as a gift through faith in   Christ!        &copy; Copyright 1999 John Piper.
