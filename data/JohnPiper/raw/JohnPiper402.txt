      February 27, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WHY GOD LAID A STONE OF STUMBLING    (1 Peter 2:4-8)        And coming to Him as to a living stone,rejected by      men, but choice and precious in te sight of God, you also, as      living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a      holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to      God through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture:      "Behold I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious corner stone,      an he who believes in Him shall not be disappointed." This      precious value, then is for you who believe. But for those who      disbelieve, "The stone which the builders rejected, this became      the very corner stone," and , "A stone of stumbling and a rock      of offense"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to      the word, and to this doom they were alsoappointed.         What I would like to do this morning is draw out the main point   of verses 6-8 and then encourage your faith with the way this   truth applies to our present situation here at Bethlehem.       Last week we looked at verses 4 and 5 and saw how coming to   Jesus, God's Living Stone causes us to be living stones and shapes   us into a spiritual house for God's dwelling and makes us a holy   priesthood so that we can offer spiritual sacrifices of praise and   obedience that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.       The key was Christ. He is the Living Stone which is the   foundation of this house and his life is imparted to all the   little stones -- us believers -- who are built into a temple that   throbs with life.       Now what we have in verses 6-8 is three Old Testament   quotations to show where Peter got this idea of Christ as a Stone   that God set down in Zion. But there is something remarkable about   the way Peter quotes these three texts. He doesn't just quote   them; he interprets them and gives them a tremendously encouraging   twist for people in our situation.       Believing on the Stone: you can't lose       In verse 6 he quotes Isaiah 28:16 and says, "Behold I lay in   Zion a choice stone, a precious corner stone, And he who believes   in Him shall not be disappointed." The point here is that if you   trust Christ, God's corner stone, you will not be disappointed.   This stone will not prove faulty. If you build your life on this   stone your life will not crumble in the storm. If you hide behind   this stone you will be safe. If you stand on the truth of this   stone you will not be ashamed. If you join with others in the   spiritual house built on this stone you will be proud of your   foundation and your fellowship will stand. "Behold I lay in Zion a   choice stone, a precious corner stone, and he who believes in Him   shall not be disappointed."       Then in verse 7a Peter draws out the lesson in his own words:   "This precious value, then, is for you who believe." He takes the   word "precious" from verse 6 -- "he is a precious corner stone" --   and says that the preciousness is for believers. If you believe on   this stone -- if you trust him and bank your future on him -- then   he is precious, because you will never be disappointed in him or   ashamed of him. Jesus will never let you down. Others may, but   Jesus never.       Now that is a great encouragement: if you knew a way never to   be disappointed or a way never to be ashamed, wouldn't you want to   know that way? Peter says: the way is to trust what Jesus will be   for you as God's "chosen and precious corner stone." God says,   "You cannot lose. You cannot be disappointed in having done this.   You cannot be put to shame." That is tremendously encouraging.       Disbelieving the Stone: you can't win       But now, why not stop there? Why does Peter go on in the middle   of verse 7 to talk about the negative side of things? Why not just   stay positive and talk about the good effects of belief, rather   than going on to talk about the negative side of unbelief?       Look at what he says in verse 7b: "But for those who   disbelieve, 'The stone which the builders rejected, this became   the very corner stone.'" Now what's the point of that? Here he's   saying that not believing in Jesus is like rejecting the stone   that God has laid as the corner stone. God sends his Son to be the   main stone in the building of his church -- his people. But some   do not trust him, they reject him.       But what effect does that have on the purpose of God? This is   the point: it does not defeat God's purpose at all. "The stone   which the builders rejected, this became the very corner stone."   The point is: If you believe on this stone, you can't lose; and if   you disbelieve on him you can't win. Human unbelief does not   frustrate or defeat the ultimate purposes of God. If God plans for   Jesus to be the chief corner stone, humans can betray him, desert   him, deny him, mock him, strike him, spit on him, hit him with   rods, crown him with thorns, strip him, crucify him and bury him   -- but they cannot stop him from being what God destined him to   be, the Living Corner Stone of a great and glorious people.       "Unto this you were appointed"       So the point of mentioning the negative side of unbelief is to   stress that it cannot win. It can't frustrate God's ultimate   purposes.       I think this is the point of the shocking verse 8 as well.   Peter goes on to say (quoting Isaiah 8:14) that Christ, became "'a   stone of stumbling and a rock of offense'; for they stumble   because they are disobedient to the word, and to this   &#91;doom&#93; they were also appointed." Peter's words at the end   of this verse are intended to sever the last strand of   self-reliance: "to this -- this stumbling, this disobedience --   they were appointed."       In other words if any proud unbeliever should boast and say, "I   have chosen my own destiny -- my own disobedience and my own   stumbling -- to show God that I have the final and ultimate say in   my life; I have the power of ultimate self-determination; and I   can frustrate the purposes of God with my own self-determining   will. If anyone boasts in that way, Peter responds with the   awesome words: No, you can't; you only think you can. But you will   discover sooner or later that whatever you choose -- and mark   this, your choice is real and crucial -- whatever you choose,   "unto this you were appointed."       God and not man will have the last say. No mere human can   thwart the ultimate purposes of God -- not by belief or unbelief.       Now why does Peter teach such a thing? Why does he even bring   it up? The reason is for our encouragement. What he means is that   human choices cannot finally destroy the temple of God. They are   not ultimate. A person can reject the chosen and precious Stone of   Jesus Christ. But if they do, two things are still true:       1) the stone will not be rejected by God, but will still be put   in the place of honor and glory for ever and ever as the chief   corner stone; and       2) the one who rejects the stone will never be able to boast   over God that he frustrated God's ultimate design for his temple.   Even unbelievers fulfil God's appointments. He cannot be defeated.   He triumphs even in his own rejection.       Now that's the lesson for us in our situation. God's great   purposes for the building of his church, including Bethlehem,   often come through seasons of rejection, but in the end he remains   triumphant and none of us can bring his purpose to ruin. If we   reject his way, we cannot destroy his plan. C.S. Lewis said once:   we all serve God inevitably, but it makes a great difference   whether you serve like Judas of serve like John. 1  In   the end God is triumphant in our belief and our unbelief. He is   triumphant in our obedience and our disobedience. Human beings,   whether good or evil, rejecting or accepting, believing or   unbelieving, cannot thwart the ultimate purposes of God. "The   stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the   corner."       God is calling us to trust him for this in these days at   Bethlehem. And I want to give you a glance at some of the   evidences of his triumphs in these awful and wonderful days.       Some encouraging words from friends of Bethlehem :       "I am struck by the spiritual maturity and godliness that I   have observed. because of what has happened and how it has been   handled, things are beginning to seem more real to me. Sin seems   more real. Spiritual maturity seems more real. Prayer seems more   real. The possibility of church unity seems more real. And God,   while no less unfathomable, seems more real.       I wrote you (Pastor John) about a year and a half ago listing   five things that I was looking for in a church. I concluded by   saying that I was begining to sense that I had found what I had   been looking for. Today there is no doubt. Yes, I am baffled and   grieved and torn and saddended by what has come to light. But I am   glad that it has come to light. I do not want in any way to   minimize the sin that has taken place. 1 Samuel 2:12-4:22 (eli's   sons, God's judgment on them and Eli, Ichabod) has added much to   my soberness and fear as has Acts 5:1-10. but at the same time I   have been overwhelmed by a spirit of humbleness, truthfulness,   brokenness, gentleness, fear (of God), and love manifested   throughout the body in general and particularly in the elders. O   how I have longed to be a part of such a church! O how wonderful   it will be when the bridegroom has finished purifying his   bride!"

       "Satan doesn't need to attack lukewarm or health and wealth   prosperity churches. He needed to infiltrate Bethlehem.       The church's handling of the crisis is Biblical and God has   begun a work here. Miracles and healing. I know of two instances   where visitors on &#91;February&#93; 13th were profoundly reached.       The service last Sunday (February 13, 1994), full of prayer,   worship in song and your words of Biblical wisdom from Revelation   was both a healing balm an a call to introspection and repentance.       God will forgive, heal and work it out for good."   







































Bethlehem   friend       "We were bable to witness love, love for God and His people,   hatred of sin, the desire for and the beginings of (by God's   grace) reconciliation of a fallen brother, brokenness, dependency   on God--we witnessed the manifestation of the Spirit of God in His   people.       I don't know everything that happened, but it was obvious that   hearts were broken. Recrimination will probably come, and maybe   that's good as it gives the Body an opportunity to undergo a   "sifting out." Maybe very little good will come out of what your   congregation has experienced--God knows. I just want to say, as a   brother in Christ, that it was very apparent to us that the   ministry occurring at Bethlehem has the mark of God. We could see   Him in the people, the elders, and in the pastor. Thank you for   the blessing of allowing us to worship with you in such a   difficult time."   

































  


















































   A friend from Indiana       "I hope you won't misunderstand what I am about to say, as I am   having difficulty putting my feelings into words, Though last   Sunday was a dark day for Bethlehem, still as I shared in jthe   service, I felt soi privileged to be there. At that smoment, I   sknew there was nowhere else on earth that I would rather have   been than at Bethlehem Baptist Church. It was a fearful and   wonderful thing to be in the presence of a God who is holy and   pure and righteous and just. So much of waht we Christians say and   do reflects our lighthearted attitude toward God. We talk about   Him as though He was a chum or a buddy and so rarely do we   consider the side of Him that despises iniquity and won't tolerate   sin. I was greatly humbled to sit among the people at Bethlehem on   Sunday and be reminded of Who God really is.       Secondly, I was deeply encouraged to witness the corporate   attitude of grief and confession, not only from your staff and   elders, but from the entire congregation. Though we considered the   sin of one, God's searchlight examined my heart as well.       God must love Bethlehem Baptist very much. He could have left   this sin undisclosed so that it would have grown and festered.   Yet, He apparently chose to have it revealed so that He could   cleansse, forgive and heal, and make the church whole once again.   You have a wounderful fellowship at Bethlehem; and though we don't   belong to your church, we have a special love for it."   













  














































   A friend visiting from another local church       "The church I grew up in was fraught with sin. Even as a middle   school and high school student I was aware of an ongoing affair in   the church that was not acknowledged or addressed for years. When   it finally was, no discipline took place, and nothing changed. The   affair continued, more secretly. I know everyone at that church   was affected by that cancer, and many other cancers, growing   unhindered among us. That is why I am so grateful to God for your   willingness to risk your personal friendships with Dean, risk   Bethlehem's excellent music ministry, risk the reputation of our   church, risk the congregation turning against you, and probably   risk much more. Thank you for your honesty and commitment to truth   and godliness. I have been overwhelmed in these meetings with the   love I have for you, the leaders of this church."   







































  






























































   Bethlehem friend       "Please be encouraged that your pain and prayers have not been   in vain, because the Lord is at work in our hearts, as weel as the   hearts of hundreds of others at Bethlehem as a result of this   season of fhumiliation. Your sensitivity and obedience to the Lord   has been made evident, and all your decisions regarding   ddisciplinary matters have been vindicated."   






































  































































   
Bethlehem friend       To the staff, elders and people of Bethlehem:       "I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the   Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord, be strong and   taqke heart and wait for the Lord" (Psalm 27:13-14).       "Come, let us return to the Lord. For He has torn us, but He   will heal us: He has wounded us, but He will bandage us. He will   revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day   that we may live before Him. So let us press on to know the Lord.   His going forth is as certain as the dawn; And Hwe will come to us   like the rain, like the spring rains that water the earth" (Hosea   6:1-3).       As certain as the dawn of this day is the certainty that God   will go forth and bring the spring rains of comfort and   restoration and healing and renewal at Bethlehem.       Saddened and sobered, yet praying with and for you in great   hope."   































  


























































   A friend from Michigan       Tonight we take up the question of how the organ plan relates   to what has happened in recent weeks. As the staff went away on   retreat this past week some of us felt that we had walked out into   the clear blue sky of hope after the tragedy of our loss, only to   turn a corner and find a monster waiting for us -- namely, the   entanglement of the organ in seven years of deception and   adultery.       But God met us with some encouraging scriptures that I will   share with you tonight that helped us interpret with hope what   that image means. All I will take the time to say now is that   there is good reason both from 1 Peter and from our recent   experience to believe that God will triumph at Bethlehem, and that   the miracle of deliverance and unity that God worked for us on   Monday morning February 7, when Dean confessed, is the kind of   miracle we may anticipate tomorrow as well. May God fill this   church with the same spirit of passionate prayer that he did three   weeks ago.            1  I can't recall the book in which I read this quote   but the substance of it is found in The Quotable Lewis, edited by   Wayne Martindale and Jerry Root, #1170.
