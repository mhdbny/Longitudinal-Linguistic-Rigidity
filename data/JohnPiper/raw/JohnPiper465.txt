       "I Am God Almighty, Be fruitful andMultiply"        God's Purpose for Jacob andBethlehem      Genesis 35:11    
   "God also said to him, 'I am God Almighty; Be fruitful andmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, andkings shall come forth from you.'"  Today's message is the introduction of a series of messages on thecommand and the empowerment of God to be fruitful and multiply as achurch. I am led to this series by the conviction that God is callingus to greater fruitfulness. This was the sense of those who came tominister to us during prayer week. It strikes a chord over and overamong the prayer warriors of this church when we cry out to Godtogether.  Repeatedly texts like Acts 9:31 have been prayed in recent weeksover this year: "The church throughout all Judea and Galilee andSamaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and, going on in the fear ofthe Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued toincrease (it was multiplied)." Or Acts 6:7 -- "The word of God kepton spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase(i.e., multiplied) greatly in Jerusalem."  More important than the sense of the pastoral leadership, or theprophetic encouragement of guest ministers, or the common chord ofpraying people, or the pattern of the book of Acts is the simple factthat God in his word reveals that it is a good thing to want to befruitful and multiply through winning people for the glory of Christand for their salvation. "My heart's desire and prayer to God forthem is that they might be saved" (Romans 10:1). "I appointed youthat you should go and bear fruit" (John 15:16). God's will is thatwe be fruitful and multiply.  So I want to introduce this series with an unusual text onevangelism. Genesis 35:9-11  Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram,and He blessed him. 10 And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; youshall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." ThusHe called him Israel. 11 God also said to him, " I am God Almighty;be fruitful and multiply;  a nation and a company of nations shallcome from you, and kings shall come forth from you."  The words that gripped me as never before -- the words that standnow over this series as the theme are: " I am God Almighty; befruitful and multiply. " This is a promise and a command. Thepromise to Jacob (now called Israel) is that God is Almighty on hisbehalf. He is not God Almighty merely in general. He is God Almightyin relation to Israel. His Almightiness is there for them. That's whyhe says it here. This is the promise that enables the command. Youcan be fruitful and multiply because I am God Almighty. I am thecovenant God of Abraham and Isaac. My Godness and my Almightiness arecovenant Godness and covenant Almightiness. And if you will trust meas God Almighty, you can and you will be fruitful and multiply.  Now the question is, Can we use these words given to Jacob mainlyabout his physical offspring to apply to our church mainly about ourspiritual offspring? You can't just take words that you like in theBible and make them apply to anything you want. There have to beBiblical reasons for the application.  So here are my Biblical reasons for taking Genesis 35:11 andapplying it to Bethlehem. Why do I believe that when God said toJacob, "I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply," he was making apromise and giving a command that included us gentiles at Bethlehemand the people who would be saved through our witness to the gospel?Put on your Biblical thinking caps for a few minutes. If this line ofthinking were merely mine, I might say, "Lord, it's a bit heavysledding." But it's not my line of thinking, amazingly. It's right atthe heart of the apostle Paul's understanding of who we are asChristians in relation to the Jewish people, and why it is that thepromises to Abraham belong to gentile Christians as well as JewishChristians. And he meant for ordinary Christians to grasp this, eventhough it demands mental effort.   Step 1. These words to Jacob are a reaffirmation andcontinuation of God's promise to Abraham, Jacob's grandfather, inGenesis 17:4-6.   As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you shall be thefather of a multitude of nations. 5 No longer shall your name becalled Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I will make you thefather of a multitude of nations. 6 And I will make you exceedinglyfruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forthfrom you.  At least four things are almost identical between the promise toAbraham here and the promise to Jacob in Genesis 35:10-11. Bothpromises contain 1) a name change (Abram to Abraham, and Jacob toIsrael), 2) promise that kings will come from them, 3) a reference tobeing fruitful, and 5) a promise that a "multitude of nations" willcome from Abram and Jacob.  That last one is the key. Notice it carefully. In Genesis 17:5 andagain in 17:6 God promises Abraham that he will be "the father of a  multitude   ( hamon ) of nations." And in 35:11 Godpromises Jacob, "A   company   ( qahal = congregation)of nations shall proceed from you." So this promise of being fruitfuland multiplying with a "multitude" or "congregation" of nations iscommon to both. Jacob's promise is a reaffirmation of the promisemade to Abraham.   Step 2. The promise that the patriarchs (Abraham and Jacob)would be fruitful with a "multitude of nations" is fulfilled in thegentiles inheriting the promises of Abraham through faith, notJewishness (Romans 4:16-17).   16 For this reason [the promise] is   by faith, that it mightbe in accordance with grace, in order that the promise may be certainto all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law [i.e.,Jewish believers], but also to those [i.e., gentiles] who are of thefaith of Abraham, who is   the father of us all   [there'sthe interpretation of Genesis 17:5], 17 (as it is written, "A FATHEROF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU") in the sight of Him whom hebelieved,  even  God, who gives life to the dead and calls intobeing that which does not exist.  Paul reasons like this: Abraham and Jacob did not seem to becamethe father of a multitude of nations in a physical sense. There werethe fathers of the twelve tribes born to Jacob. And there were inaddition the Ishmaelites (descendants of Ishmael) and the Edomites(descendants of Esau). But these 14 peoples do not make a "multitude"of nations. So Paul ponders the possibility that this fruitfulnessmay include spiritual children, not just physical.  He finds evidence for this in several places (cf. Romans 4:18 andGenesis 15). For example, he notices that in Genesis 12:3 that Godhad said to Abram, "In you all the families of the earth shall beblessed" (cf. Galatians 3:8). He noticed that this blessing is comingto the families of the world not through physical descent, butspiritual. So he sees Genesis 17:5 in this light. Becoming the fatherof a "multitude of nations" (in 17:5) is the same as "blessing allthe families of the earth (in 12:3).   Step 3. Paul shows that what unites Abraham and the gentiles toGod is faith, not Jewishness, so that now all how trust Christ (theseed of Abraham) are true offspring of Abraham and heirs of thepromises (Galatians 3:6-8).   Look at Galatians 3:6-7 to see this:  Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS(= Genesis 15:6). 7 Therefore, be sure that   it is those who areof faith who are sons of Abraham  .  The key here is that faith, not Jewishness, makes you a trueoffspring of Abraham (and Jacob). So how is it that Abraham and Jacobbecome fruitful and multiply with a "multitude of nations?" Theanswer is that they are fruitful and multiply when Christians witnessto the gospel and win unbelievers to faith in Christ. Every gentileand every Jew who puts faith in Christ becomes a "child of Abraham"and an heir of the promises. The key is belonging to Christ, who isTHE offspring of Abraham (cf. Galatians 3:16). As Paul says inGalatians 3:29, "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham'soffspring, heirs according to promise."   Step 4. Therefore, when God says to Jacob, "I am God Almighty;be fruitful and multiply," he includes in his meaning, "Letmultitudes of Jews and Gentiles in all generations be saved throughfaith in Christ, and become heirs of the promises of God."   Which means that these words belong to us. They are God's word toBethlehem as well as Jacob. We are children of Abraham and Isaac andJacob, because we have believed on the Messiah, Jesus Christ. So weare now in the great covenant line of promise. Everyone we lead toChrist is a fulfillment of this promise, "I am God Almighty; befruitful and multiply."  Let me close with two implications of this truth.  First, it means that the Almightiness of God is the confidence ofour witnessing to unbelievers. We do not enter this week of witnesson our own strength. Let these words ring in your ears, "I am GodAlmighty! THEREFORE, be fruitful and multiply." When John the Baptistconfronted some Jews who boasted in their Jewishness that itguaranteed them salvation he said (in Luke 3:8), "Do not begin to sayto yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I say to youthat God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham."  And God does just that. He raises up from stones children toAbraham. He takes the hard, stony, unbelieving gentiles in our livesand turns them into humble believers in Jesus through your witnessand mine. That's the main point of saying he is God Almighty. He cando that. We can't. He can. So keep listening when he says, "I am GodAlmighty; be fruitful and multiply."  This is the very same logic that Jesus uses in Matthew 28:18-19when he says, "All authority has been given to   me in heavenand on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations." Inother words, "I am Christ Almighty; go and be fruitful and multiply."Our confidence comes from the authority and the Almightiness ofChrist.  Finally, let's get very practical and apply this to the people welove and long to see come to Christ in faith and be saved. There arecards in your worship folder with spaces for you to write a few ofthese people's names. Would you do that as we close and promise topray for them daily through June. With confidence welling up fromthis amazing word of promise, let's ask God that in 1996 there be anaverage of one profession of faith per day in response to ourwitness. Do you waver. Listen. "I am God Almighty -- ALMIGHTY! Befruitful and multiply."  Copyright 1996 John Piper
