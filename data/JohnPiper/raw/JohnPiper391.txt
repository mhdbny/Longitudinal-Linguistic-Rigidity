       TRUE CHRISTIANITY:    Inexpressible Joy in the Invisible Christ    (1 Peter 1:8-9)        And though you have not seen Him, you love Him,      and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you      greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,      obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your      souls.         
        Peter's description of the Christian   experience        Our focus this morning is on verses 8 and 9. The question I   want to start with is this: why does Peter tell the Christians   what they are experiencing? He says, "Though you have not seen   Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe   in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of   glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of   your souls."       He tells them what they are experiencing: "You are loving   Christ; you are believing in Christ; you are rejoicing in Christ   with inexpressible and glorified joy; all of that even though you   do not now see him." Why? Why tell them what their own experience   is?       I think the reason is that he wants to describe for them, what   true Christianity really is. And to do it in such a way that, if   they ever drift away from it, they will have a fixed standard to   show them what's happening, so they can wake up and return to what   they've lost.        Illustration: swimming upstream        I picture it like this (it's not a perfect picture, but it   helped me get a handle on why Peter would tell them about their   own experience): true Christianity is like swimming upstream in a   river of godlessness -- for us, secular American godlessness. We   swim with the stroke of love to Christ, and the stroke of faith in   Christ, and the stroke of joy in Christ. And while we swim we do   not get swept away with the godless toward the terrible cataracts   of judgment down river.       God keeps us, as verse 5 said, through faith. He enables us to   keep on swimming against the stream with the strokes of faith,   love and joy, so that we don't get carried away in the current of   Christlessness.       Our swimming coach, the apostle Peter, is on the shore watching   us and following us. When we are swimming well he calls out to us,   "Look here, you're doing well, I'm putting a flag here even with   where you are in the river. Now mark this. This is where you are."   That's what he's doing in verses 8 and 9.       The reason is so that if we stop using the swimming strokes of   love for Jesus, and faith in Jesus, and joy in Jesus, and begin to   just float downstream in the river of godlessness, we will be able   to wake up and look to the shore and notice that the flag is   upstream. We will have a fixed point of reference to call us back   to what real Christianity is.       So that's what I want to do this morning. Peter did it for the   Christians then, and I am going to try to do it with his words for   you now -- to plant a flag on the side of the river of American   godlessness and call you to look at it to see where you are in   your Christian swimming.        Five things about Christians        Peter says five things (in verses 8-9) about his Christian   readers:              they love Christ;              they believe in Christ;              they rejoice in Christ;              through all this they are receiving the salvation of their      souls; and              they are experiencing this even though, like us, they have      never seen Christ in person.            This is true Christianity: God is saving our souls by working   in our hearts a love and confidence and a joy that is against the   stream of secularism and godlessness and worldliness in our   society.       True Christianity is loving Christ and trusting Christ and   enjoying Christ. In other words, Christianity is first and   foremost a matter of the heart (love, trust and joy), not a matter   of external performances. And Peter adds in verse 9: in this you   are now (progressively) receiving the goal of it all, the   salvation of your soul. The final full salvation ready to be   revealed in the last time (v.5) we are now receiving for our souls   (in part) as we love Christ, trust Christ and rejoice in Christ   now.       
 Three definitions of loving Christ, trusting   Christ and enjoying Christ        Let's see if we can get inside these three experiences and see   how they relate and whether we are in fact experiencing them or   not. What do we really mean when we speak of loving Christ and   trusting Christ and enjoying Christ? We will start with three   definitions:        
Loving Christ        1. Loving Christ means experiencing Christ as precious for   all
 his character and virtue (cf. 2:7).        
Trusting Christ        2.


 Trusting Christ means experiencing Christ   as reliable in all his promises and all his counsel.       In other words:       Love is attracted to the Beloved for who he is.       Faith is confident in the Trusted for what he will do.        Enjoying Christ        Now what about joy? Peter says (v.8) "we rejoice (in Christ)   with inexpressible and glorified joy." The more I think about it,   and the more I consider Biblical texts (like Philippians 1:25 and   Romans 15:13 and 2 Corinthians 1:24) the less I think we should   conceive of joy as separate from love and faith.       Joy in Christ is the deep good feelings in loving him and   believing him. It's the echo in our emotions -- our hearts -- of   experiencing Christ as precious and experiencing Christ as   reliable. It's the deep good feelings of being attracted to him   for who he is and the deep good feelings of being confident in him   for what he will do.       So joy is part of love and part of faith. Because it would be a   contradiction (wouldn't it?) to say, "I am attracted to the   preciousness of what Christ is, but I have no good feelings in   this attraction." What is attraction without good feelings for   something? There may be terror in the attraction (as to a Lion   named Aslan) but if there were no deep good feelings in it, it   would not be experienced as attraction at all, but only as   rejection.       It is the same with faith: it would be a contradiction to say,   "I am confidently trusting in what Christ will do for me, but I   have no good feelings in this confidence." What is confidence   without good feelings of hope and assurance in the one you trust?   There may be expectation of pain and suffering on the way, but if   there were no deep good feeling that it's going to turn out well,   it would not be called trust or confidence at all.       So I conclude that attraction to the ultimate preciousness of   Christ (which we call love), and confidence in the ultimate   reliability of Christ (which we call faith) are not less than a   deep good feeling, called joy. They are more; there are other   elements in them besides the deep good feeling of joy, but they   are not less than joy. So this holy joy that Peter refers to in   verse 8 is a constituent part of love and faith, and together they   are true Christianity.       This goes a long way to explaining why Peter calls this joy   "inexpressible and full of glory (or glorified)."        
Joy: you become what you crave        What gives joy its quality? I don't mean merely its intensity,   but its moral character? What makes joy ugly or beautiful?   depraved or noble? Dirty or clean? The answer is that the thing   enjoyed gives joy its character. If you enjoy dirty jokes and   bathroom language and lewd pictures, then your heart is dirty and   your joy is dirty. If you enjoy cruelty and arrogance and revenge   then your heart and your joy have that character. Or the more you   get your joy simply from material things the more your heart and   your joy shrivel up like a mere material thing. You become like   what you crave.       Peter says (in v.8) that Christian joy is inexpressible and   glorified. So how does it become that like that? It becomes like   that because Christian joy is the joy of craving the preciousness   of Jesus and the reliability of Jesus. You become like what you   crave. Christians crave Christ. Therefore they become like Christ.   Christ's preciousness and reliability are inexpressibly great, and   so our joy is inexpressible in him. And Christ has in him all the   glory of the universe and of God, and so our joy in him is a   glorified joy -- that is, a joy being changed from one degree to   another by his glory as we are attracted by its preciousness and   as we are confident in its reliability. We become what we crave   and what Christians crave above all else is the glory of Christ.   So our joy is "inexpressible and glorified" because it is joy in   loving Christ and trusting Christ who is inexpressibly glorious.        Seeing what you cannot see:        The Gospels are better than being there!       But how do we come to crave the preciousness of Christ and   trust the reliability of Christ if we can't see him? How do you   love him and believe in him, if you can't see him?       I think the answer to that question is that even though we   don't see him face to face with our physical eyes, we do see him   in another way that is even more important. For example, in Romans   15:20-21, Paul described his mission to unreached peoples (who   could never see Christ physically) like this: "I aspired to preach   the gospel, not where Christ was already named... but as it is   written, 'They who had no news of Him shall see, and they who have   not heard shall understand.'" In the preaching of the gospel   Christ can be seen in a way that is more important than seeing him   physically.       Hundreds of people in Jesus' life time saw him physically and   never really saw him. "Seeing they did not see," Jesus said. There   is a seeing that is infinitely more important than seeing with the   eyes. In 2 Corinthians 4:6 Paul describes it like this: "The God,   who said, 'Light shall shine out of darkness,' is the One who has   shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the   glory of God in the face of Christ." There is a spiritual seeing   in the heart of the glory of God in the face of Christ, and   without it no one is saved. Michael Card expressed the paradox of   not seeing yet seeing in one of his songs like this:       To hear with my heart       to see with my soul       to be guided by a hand I cannot hold       to trust in a way that I cannot see       that's what faith must be.       "That's What Faith Must Be" Music and words by Michael Card       How does it happen? How is this kind of seeing happen? It   happens through the word of God. When the gospel of Christ is   preached we can see Christ more clearly for who he really is than   many could see in his own lifetime. If you read the Gospels,   Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, with openness to Christ, you can see   the true glory of Christ far more clearly than most of the people   who knew him on earth could see him -- Nicodemus, the   Syrophoenecian woman, the Centurion, the widow of Nain, Zacchaeus,   the thief on the cross, the thronging crowds. They saw a snatch   here and a snatch there. But in the Gospels you get four   complementary portraits of Christ inspired by God and covering the   whole range of his teaching and his ministry.       The Gospels are better than being there. You are taken into the   inner circle of the apostolic band where you never could have   gone. You go with him through Gethsemane and the trial and the   crucifixion and the resurrection and the meetings after the   resurrection. You hear whole sermons and long discourses -- not in   isolated snatches on hillsides but in rich God-inspired contexts   that take you deeper than you ever could have gone as a perplexed   peasant in Galilee. You see the whole range of his character and   power which nobody on earth saw as fully as you can now see in the   Gospels: you see his freedom from anxiety with no place to lay his   head, his courage in the face of opposition, his unanswerable   wisdom, his honoring women, his tenderness with children, his   compassion toward lepers, his meekness in suffering, his patience   with Peter, his tears over Jerusalem, his blessing those who   cursed him, his heart for the nations, his love for the glory of   God, his simplicity and devotion, his power to still storms and   heal the sick and multiply bread and cast out demons.       Though you do not now see him, yet in another sense you do see   him far better than thousands who saw him face to face. You see   the glory of God shining in this man's face at every turn in the   Gospels. And because you see him with the eyes of the heart you   love him and trust him and rejoice with joy inexpressible and full   of glory. This is true Christianity.       That is the flag waving on the side of the river of   godlessness. I pray that if you are looking at it this morning   from downstream floating comfortably toward destruction that God   will wake you up and open the eyes of your heart and set you to   stroking -- not with legal works to earn anything from God, but   with the stroke of love and faith and joy. That is true   Christianity.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
