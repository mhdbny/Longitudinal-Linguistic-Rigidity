    August 13, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THIS MAN RECEIVES SINNERS AND EATS WITHTHEM   An Introduction to the Series    (Luke 15:1-2)           Now all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were comingnear Him to listen to Him.    And both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying,This man receives    sinners and eats with them.         Introduction to the Series     The plan I believe the Lord wants us tofollow in the four Sundays  up through Labor Day Weekend is a four part series of messages onLuke 15. I invite you to  turn there with me now. Virtually everyone agrees that chapter 15is a distinct unit in  Luke&#146;s gospel. It begins (in verses 1-2) with Jesus eatingwith tax-gatherers and  sinners and with the Pharisees and scribes grumbling about that,and saying This man  receives sinners and eats with them. In response to thatgrumbling Jesus tells three  parables: a short one about a lost sheep (in verses 3-7), anothershort one about a lost  coin (in verses 8-10), and a longer one about the lost son,sometimes called The  Parable of the Prodigal Son (in verses 11-24), which endswith a very crucial and  tragic addition about the elder son who stayed at home but waseven more lost than his  prodigal brother (verses 25-32).    In other words, this whole chapter isJesus&#146; response to the  pharisees&#146; grumbling, in verse two, that he receivessinners and eats with  them. The whole chapter is an answer to the question: Whatdoes it mean that you are  eating with sinners? The first answer is this: When I receivesinners and eat with them,  it means that a shepherd is finding his sheep and rejoicing it.The second answer is this:  When I receive sinners and eat with them it means that a woman hasfound her lost coin and  his rejoicing over it. The third answer: When I receive sinnersand eat with them, it  means that a lost and desperate son is coming home into the armsof a forgiving Father and  a great celebration is about to happen.     And would that this is all that it meant! Butit&#146;s not. Jesus goes  on to add: When I receive sinners and eat with them, it also meansthat those who will not  join me in this -- who will not seek and receive sinners, andcelebrate with all of heaven  -- have never known what it is to live on the Father&#146;s grace,even though they have  been at home all this time and have have served him with hard workyear in and year out.    So today I want to focus on verses 1-2 and seeChrist receiving and  eating with sinners in the wider context. Next Sunday I want us tofocus on Christ&#146;s  pursuit of the lost sheep and the lost coin and the joy in heavenover one sinner who  repents. The Sunday after that, Lord willing, we will focus on thefutility of running  from God and the outstretched arms of the Father. And finally wewill ask: What could be  wrong with hardworking son who says, Look! For so many yearsI have been serving  you, and I have never neglected a command of yours?    The aim of this chapter is to show Christ. Andour aim in digging into  it is to see Christ -- so that we can know him and love him andtrust him and worship him  and follow him toward sinners in the Twin Cities, and among thepeoples of the world where  he lives and works today.     Tax-gatherers and Sinners           Now all the tax-gatherers and the sinnerswere coming near Him to    listen to Him. And both the Pharisees and the scribes began togrumble, saying, This    man receives sinners and eats with them.        Tax-gatherers were mainly Jewish men whopurchased from the Roman  officials the right to collect various taxes and customs andtolls. The system abounded  with abuses. The tax gatherers were were cordially hated anddespised by their  fellow countrymen (I. H. Marshall,  Luke , p. 143) --not only because they  were looked on as unpatriotic, and dishonest and greedy, but alsobecause their job made  them ritually unclean. So pious Jews saw them as being alienatedfrom God. These  tax-gatherers were coming near to Jesus to listen to him.    The other group coming near to him are called,sinners:  Verse 1:      Tax-gatherers and sinners were coming nearto him to listen to him .    This sounds strange to us, because we know thatall people are sinners  in one sense; and because tax-gatherers certainly were. But itdidn&#146;t sound strange  in Jesus&#146; situation. For the pharisees and scribes,sinners was used for  a class of persons who were marked by manifestly immoral lives orquestionable occupations  -- people that no respectable Jew would have anything to do with.You can see an example  of who is in mind from Matthew 21:32 Jesus said,          Truly I say to you that the tax-gatherers and harlots  will get    into the kingdom of God before you.       Or another example would be people with certaindiseases or  disabilities that many would take as a sign that they committedsome great sin. (See John  9:1-2.) They were physically and morally unapproachable.    So the point is that these people: the tax-gatherers, the prostitutes,  the maimed and diseased -- basically, the social and religiousoutcasts -- were coming to  Jesus and he was receiving them and eating with them.    This was so obviously offensive and morallyincorrect that the  Pharisees and scribes didn&#146;t even have to give any reason fortheir displeasure. All  they had to do was state the obvious fact, and the guilt was plainto everyone. Verse 2:  This man receives sinners and eats with them.That&#146;s all you had to say.  Guilty. Case closed We know from sources outside the New Testamentsome of the principles  that guided their behavior. One said, Let not a manassociate with the wicked, not  even to bring him to the law (Strack-Billerbeck, II, 208).In other words separatism  and ritual purity took precedence over winning someone back toGod&#146;s law through  forgiveness and restoration.    So Jesus was unclean and lawless as far as theywere concerned. Even  more, he must join the sinners in their meals because he is likethem. Jesus said in Luke  7:30,           The Son of Man has come eating anddrinking; and you say,    Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax-gatherers and    sinners!        So he is seen as ritually unclean and lawlessand guilty of the same  dissolute drunkenness and gluttony they associated with thesinners.    Is that what it meant when Jesus receivedsinners and ate with  them? No. And we will see more and more clearly, I hope,over the next three weeks  what it  did  mean -- for him  then  and for us today . But before we look  at his response in parables, I want us to see Jesus&#146; behaviorthe way Luke saw it.     The Deadly Result of Self-exaltation     Luke is putting his Gospel together in acertain way to make some  things crystal clear about Jesus. Luke chooses his accounts andputs them together with a  point. And so I want us to back up and walk with Luke from thebeginning of chapter 14 to  our text in chapter 15. When I did this for myself, it doubled theimpact of Jesus eating  with sinners.    In Luke 14:1-6 Jesus goes to eat with aPharisee on the Sabbath. You  see that in verse one:           He went into the house of one of theleaders of the Pharisees on    the Sabbath to eat bread.        So be careful of saying that Jesus only offeredhis acceptance and  fellowship to tax-gatherers and sinners by eating with them. Herehe is eating with a  Pharisee.    Don&#146;t miss the obvious here: Jesus ismoving around among  non-disciples. That&#146;s not all he did. But he did a lot ofit.    Then a man comes in who has dropsy. He wasswollen with an abnormal  accumulation of fluid in the tissues and cavities of his body. Sohere is one of those  people whose appearance did not help people feel pleasant. Jesusasked the pharisees if it  was lawful to heal on the sabbath. They were silent. So he healsthe man. Response?  Nothing. No worship. No repentance for hardness of heart. Justsilence.    Why? Jesus puts his finger on it in verses 7-11. Verse 7:           . . . He noticed how they had beenpicking out the places of honor     at the table.         In other words these people are so in love withthe praise and the  approval of men that they cannot see the glory of self-givinglove. What do they care  about a man with a gross disease like dropsy? He is divertingattention away from their  main concern: how to be thought highly of. They are blinded andhardened by their love  affair with self-exaltation. So Jesus tells them (in v. 10) thatwhen they are invited to  a dinner they should go and recline at the  last  place.Because, as verse 11 says,           Everyone who exalts himself shall behumbled, and he who humbles    himself shall be exalted.        One of the great cravings of our sinful humanheart is the pleasure of  being exalted by the importance of the people we know and and thepeople we spend time  with. We feel a kind of substitute significance when significantpeople take notice of us.  And if we love this feeling enough, it will make us indifferent tounimportant people, and  eventually make us contemptuous of them. In other words there is aclose connection  between the first issue in Luke 14 and the second issue: betweenapathy toward a man with  dropsy and craving for the best seats at the feast. Craving ourown honor blinds us to the  beauty of serving the lowly.    So in verses 12-14 Jesus presses the issue ofself-exaltation in a  striking way:          When you give a luncheon or a dinner, donot invite your friends or    your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest theyalso invite you in return,    and repayment come to you. But when you give a reception, invitethe poor, the crippled,    the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, since they do nothave the means to repay    you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of therighteous.        So Jesus says to this man who invited him: Youand your friends devote  your life -- in a kind of mutual admiration society -- to havingeach other over for  dinner and spending time with each other. And when you gettogether you vie for getting  the most attention from each other. And the result is that yourlife is one of  upright indifference to the the poor, thecrippled, the lame, the  blind. Why? Because there is no payoff in this world foryour self-exaltation. They  can&#146;t invite you back. They are a kind of black hole ofcharity. You give and you  give and you give, and they stay blind and lame and maimed andpoor, so they can&#146;t  invite you back.    But Jesus says: there is a reward if you lovethe outcast, the  unimportant. Verse 14:      . . . you will be repaid at the resurrectionof the righteous.     In other words the power to get free frombondage to self-exaltation  and apathy toward unattractive people with dropsy, is to love whatGod will be for you in  the resurrection more than you love hobnobbing with importantpeople and the pleasures of  a closed dinner circle.    In other words what frees you to live radicallyfor others in this  world is the confidence that this world is not the main world.    Then in verses 15-24 Jesus launches into aparable about a banquet.  It&#146;s a picture of God&#146;s invitation to the great banquetof Christianity. Verse  16:      A certain man was giving a big dinner, andhe invited many.     But one by one they refused to come. One had afield to go see (v. 18).  Another had to go check out five yoke of oxen (v. 19). Another hadjust married a wife and  couldn&#146;t come (v. 20).     Notice it&#146;s not evil things. It&#146;sjust ordinary life  that&#146;s keeping people from the kingdom. People who just liveas if this world is the  main world.    So the host of the dinner in the parable saidto his servant (in verse  21),           Go out at once into the streets and lanesof the city and bring in    here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.        Now notice that this list of people in verse 21is exactly the same  list as in verse 13. So he had told them before that when they  give a dinner they  should invite the outcasts and the poor. Now he is telling themwith a parable that this  is what  God  does. God&#146;s heart is expansive toward thepoor and the crippled  and the blind and the lame. Verse 23:           And the master said to the slave,Go out into the highways    and along the hedges, and compel  them  to comein, that my house may be    filled.              Jesus: Showing the Father&#146;s Heart andFilling the Father&#146;s  House     Here we need to make the connection withLuke 15. You can see it  clearly. In Luke 15 Jesus is eating with tax-gatherers andsinners. Pharisees and scribes  are grumbling about it. What is he doing eating with the outcasts?Well, he will tell us  in the next three weeks with the parables of chapter 15. But hehas already told us -- and  shown us, in chapter 14.    God intends for his house to be full and forhis eternal food to be  enjoyed. So he sends his Son to give his life a ransom for many(Mark 10:45) and to  personally call the guests to God&#146;s heavenly banquet. But thescribes and pharisees  are too much in love with the seats of honor, and with theordinary things of this world  (fields, oxen and family), to care much about heaven or harlots orpeople with dropsy and  bad reputations. So Jesus goes to the highways andhedges (v. 24) to find the  poor the crippled the blind and the lame -- and the tax-gatherersand sinners. And he eats  with them.    Which means he gives them a foretaste of whatthe Father offers -- a  banquet with the accepting, forgiving Son of God. What&#146;s hedoing? He is showing the  Father&#146;s heart and filling the Father&#146;s house.That&#146;s what Luke 15 is going  to be about.     But what I wanted you to see this morning isthat it is not just Luke  15. It is also Luke 14. It is the whole Gospel of Luke. Indeed itis the gospel of our  Lord Jesus Christ. The Son of Man came to seek and to save thatwhich was lost (Luke  19:10). He sought them, he received them, he ate with them and hesaved them.     This is our life and our hope -- that we have aSavior like this and a  Father like this. And what chapter 14 makes plain is that to besaved by him is a call to  be like him.     I want to talk more about that tonight fromLuke 14:25-35. Is the the  call of Jesus an invitation to a banquet or a invitation to die?    When I was in Tennessee speaking earlier thisweek to the TEAM  missionaries at their annual conference I watched a video aboutthe ministry of I. A. M.  in Kabul Afghanistan. Two million amputees owing to the war withRussia and then the civil  war. Blindness. Orphaned thousands. Very little medicine andhealth care that we take for  granted. All in a Muslim context of unbelief in Jesus Christ. Butthere, at risk to their  own lives daily, Christian people inviting the poor and thecrippled and the lame and the  blind -- and the sinner and the grateful and the ungrateful -- tosee Jesus and come to  the banquet of love.    And the effect on me was to make want to comeback to Bethlehem and  give my life to building with you a fellowship of suffering andjoy in the service of  others. To build a people who are so satisfied in all that Godpromises to be for us in  Jesus that we don&#146;t need to be invited back and we don&#146;tneed the seats of honor  and who will not let our fields and our oxen (cars, computers) oreven our families keep  us from the kind of sacrifice and joy Jesus promises in pursuingthe lost.    It&#146;s good to be home. I invite you to seekwith me the Lord&#146;s  power for this week&#146;s calling -- and the Lord&#146;s revivalto create a mighty army  of Christians who will die to seek the lost. You will be repaid inthe resurrection of the  just.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
