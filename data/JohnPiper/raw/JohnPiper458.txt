     Introduction and Review     I invite you to turn in your Bibles toColossians 3:8-17. We will  read this in a few minutes to bring God&#146;s word to bear on ourthinking. First, let me  set the stage.    In recent weeks we have been unfolding themeaning of our mission as a  church which the elders and Master Planning Team formulated overthe past year. The  Mission is on page one. The reaffirmed vision of 2000 by 2000 ison page seven. The  Spiritual Dynamic that drives this Mission and Vision is on pagetwo. And the Fresh  Initiatives for the immediate future of our mission are on pagethree. These six Fresh  Initiatives are the focus of my messages in these next severalweeks.    The very term Fresh Initiatives isunsettling for some of  us. We love having things stay the same. It is comfortable and wefeel at home.  That&#146;s a normal and innocent bent in our nature. But thedanger is that we will  harden in our bent. And when even good and needed change comes, itfeels threatening -- as  if it would break us, rather than mold us and help us be what Godis calling us to be.    I have tried in these weeks this fall to unfoldthe Mission Statement  and the Spiritual Dynamic of our life together so that you couldsee that some things are  rock solid at Bethlehem. The ground under our feet is not shaking.God&#146;s word is  sure. God&#146;s glory is central. God&#146;s grace is all-sufficient. Our affirmation of  faith is not wavering. Our Reformed-orientation on the sovereigntyof God is as strong as  ever. Our openness to the whole work of the Holy Spirit is as wideas ever. Our desire for  all the fullness of God is unchanged. Our commitment to worldevangelization is  undiminished. The combination of head and heart is still apriority. Our longing to see  this city awakened with the reviving power of the gospel is asstrong as ever. And the  list could go on and on. Read the values (pages 4-6) and you willsee dozens of old and  cherished priorities that remain unchanged.    If you need that to maintain your equilibriumin these days, do it. By  all means, do it.    But the point of page three -- the FreshInitiatives -- is to call for  change -- change within the large, unshakable commitments we havebeen talking about, but  change nevertheless. What this will look like, only God knows forsure. No mere human is  managing the prayers and thoughts and dreams of the seventeen taskforces that are working  to flesh out these things into practical suggestions. And myprayer and confidence is that  God is so overruling in this whole process that what will emergewill be the unique  ministry design that he promises to bless at Bethlehem.     The Fresh Initiatives don&#146;t defineprograms. They adjust  direction. Programs may or may not follow. The Initiatives callfor new intentions and new  efforts. The first Fresh Initiative (looked at last week) callsfor new efforts in  developing an atmosphere where personal, deepening, supportive,faith-building  relationships are highly valued as an expression of our passion ofthe supremacy of God.  The newness here is not in desire or value, but in intentionallyand priority. What this  will look like I don&#146;t know. It may not look like anything.It may only feel  radically and wonderfully right.     Urban-Suburban Partnership     The second Fresh Initiative (Urban-suburbanpartnership) is what we  take up today. It says, We will strive to forge a mutuallyenriching urban-suburban  partnership, in which a significant range of racially,educationally, and economically  diverse people feel at home, as they grow in their passion for thesupremacy of God.    We are going to get to our text. But let megive a word about the  background of this Initiative first. The background demands thatyou read this initiative  in two ways. First, there are some members and regular attendersof Bethlehem who live in  the suburbs and some who live in the urban center. Specifically,from our last year&#146;s  survey 12% of our people live within a five minutes&#146; drive ofthe church -- these are  our urban dwellers. 21% live between 5 and 15 minutes. 35% livebetween 15 and 25 minutes.  And 11% live over 25 minutes away. So you can see that, though weare located here in the  center of Minneapolis, our people come from all over the citiesand suburbs. Last year 88%  lived outside the urban center. 46% lived over 15 minutes&#146;drive away.    Ever since I came to Bethlehem in 1980 andmoved to be a part of the  church&#146;s neighborhood we have said that proximityimplies accountability.  The church&#146;s gathering here means something. Within a shorttime we called a full  time associate for urban ministry. Dozens of families have movedinto the city as part of  the challenge to come make a difference in the city. Ministries ofall kinds have sprung  up over the years. And we have clearly put a priority on urbanministry. This is where we  come and meet and proximity implies some accountability. The richman in Luke 16 was not  rebuked for ignoring all the poor in his city, but for ignoringLazarus whom he passed by  every day (vv. 19-26).    But one of the upshots of this focus on urbanministry -- and urban  living as part of that ministry -- is that the urbs and the burbssometimes feel estranged  or put off by each other. It becomes easy to point the finger andthink unkind thoughts.  Initiative #2 is a call for these two groups to see their presencehere as mutually  enriching and not as competitive or threatening. That is one wayof seeing the background  of Initiative #2.    The other way of seeing the background ofInitiative #2 is that the  make up of the people we live among and want to reach for Christand his kingdom is not  the same in the suburbs and in the urban core. For example, inMinneapolis (not just the  urban center, but the whole city) in 1990 13% of the populationwas African American and  3.3% was Native American. In the suburban Metro area outsideMinneapolis and St. Paul 1.3%  of the population was African American and .04% was NativeAmerican. And of course if you  considered only the area within five minutes of this building theproportion of the people  of color would be dramatically higher. And the same disparitybetween the urban center and  the suburbs could be shown in economic and educational terms aswell.    This means that the challenges of localevangelism and disciple making  and assimilation into fellowship are radically different dependingon where you live. That  is the other way of thinking about the background of Initiative#2. We must not only see  each other in a mutually enriching partnership, we believe, moreand more, that God is  calling us to broaden the range of people -- racially,educationally, and economically --  who feel at home here. And that both urban and suburban peopleshould feel good about  that.    The Master Planning Team and Elders are notcompletely naive at this  point. We know that there are limits to whom you can make feel athome. For example there  are language limits. We are committed in this service to speakingEnglish. That eliminates  most of the world&#146;s population from feeling at home here.Other churches must help.  The point of Initiative #2 is not to say that we have to makeevery potential urban and  suburban attender feel at home. The point is that in the past 15years the range of who  fits was, we believe, too narrow. Thus we call for asignificant range and  leave it undefined. This is a direction, not a program. But thedirection is important.  That&#146;s the background of Initiative #2.      Colossians 3:8-17     Now it is time to read God&#146;s word,Colossians 3:8-17          But now you also, put them all aside:anger, wrath, malice,    slander, and abusive speech from your mouth. Do not lie to oneanother, since you laid    aside the old self with its evil practices, and have put on thenew self who is being    renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the Onewho created him --a renewal    in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew,circumcised and uncircumcised,    barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, andin all. And so, as those    who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart ofcompassion, kindness,    humility, gentleness and patience; bearing with one another, andforgiving each other,    whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgaveyou, so also should you.    And beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfectbond of unity. And let the    peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you werecalled in one body; and be    thankful. Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, withall wisdom teaching and    admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritualsongs, singing with    thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in wordor deed, do all in the    name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God theFather.         Choose Where You Live for Christ&#146;sSake     I want to make two points from this text. One is that Christians  should choose where they live for Christ&#146;s sake.  If youchoose to live in the  suburbs it should be because you have thought it through with aview to honoring Christ  more this way. If you live in the urban center it should bebecause you have thought it  through with a view to honoring Christ more this way. I get thisconviction from verse 17  and others in the New Testament like it: Whatever you do inword or deed [like  buying a house or renting a apartment], do all in the name of theLord Jesus, giving  thanks through Him to God the Father.    One of the great dangers in AmericanChristianity is that we will  simply absorb the values of our culture. We will think ofChristianity as an ethic that  relates to certain moral issues (adultery, alcohol, abortion,stealing, lying, violence,  foul language, etc.), and forget that being a Christian means thateverything --  everything is under the rule of Christ. Our mission is tospread a passion for the  supremacy of God IN EVERYTHING. Including choosing where welive.    So verse 17 -- do all (do everything!) in thename of the Lord Jesus --  means: urbs and burbs, be sure that you have made your choice ofwhere to live for  Christ-exalting reasons. In the name of the Lord Jesusmeans with his  authorization and by his strength and for his glory. In otherwords it means that all we  do what we do with a view to honoring him as the Lord and thestrength and the goal of our  lives.    When that decision is made, then live where youlive with all your  might for the glory of the Lord Jesus, and let your brother orsister stand of fall before  their own Lord -- in the city or in the suburb. There are good,Christ-exalting reasons  for living in the suburbs and good, Christ exalting reasons forliving in the urban  center. If I served a church in the suburbs I have little doubtthat I would live in the  suburbs near the building, just like I live near the center of ourchurch&#146;s life here  in the city.     Test your motives. Why do you live where youlive? How did you make  that choice? Did you buy on the outer ring in the hope of fastappreciation? Did you buy  in the city in hopes of catching the front end ofregentrification? Not the best of  motives, either one. It is possible to move to the city for wrongreasons, and to move to  the suburbs of the wrong reasons. And it is possible to stay inthe one or the other for  the wrong reasons -- fear, apathy, pride, greed, inordinate loveof things, etc.  Why   do you live where you live, that is the question.    I need to clarify the meaning of what you willhear in the years to  come, lest you take it wrongly. The choice to live in the suburbsis the easier choice.  It&#146;s the one that most people take, if they can afford it --black or white or Asian.  If you can afford it, you leave. That&#146;s the natural thing todo. I don&#146;t know of  any church that has developed a program to help their urban peoplebe willing to move to  the suburbs. Such programs are not necessary. Almost all thenatural gravity pulls in that  direction. There never has been a white flight -- or any othercolored flight -- from the  suburbs to the center of the city. Downward mobility is un-American.    Therefore, I take as part of my calling in thischurch to so preach and  to so live as to persuade some Christians to move to the city tospread a passion of the  supremacy of God in all things. Not because I think it is wrong tolive in the suburbs,  but because it is most definitely right -- and gloriously right --to live for Christ and  his kingdom in the city, and almost nothing in our materialistic,security-driven,  fun-seeking culture is going to motivate you to consider it. Inshort the church  doesn&#146;t need as much help to spread itself as salt throughthe suburbs as it does to  spread itself as salt through the decaying inner city.    When Fresh Initiative #2 calls for apartnership between these two  groups it is calling for the urban folks not to be proud andarrogant over what God has  done to bring them here. And it is calling for the suburban folksto glory in their  appointed ministry and not to resent the necessary focus andeffort to swim against the  tide to help people survive in the city. I hope that Bethlehemwill be a place where more  and more suburban people are saved and love to be a part of achurch that is committed to  the city, while staying right where God calls them.     The Supremacy of Christ Unifies DiversePeoples     The second thing to see in this text isthat what holds the range  of diversity together in the church is the supremacy of Christ. Inverse 11 Paul says that  in the new people that God is creating,  there is nodistinction between Greek and  Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave andfreeman, but Christ is  all, and in all . Now this is amazing. Fresh Initiative#2 calls for a  significant range of racially, educationally, and economicallydiverse people. That  is what we have in verse 11. Jews and Greeks did not dress thesame or eat the same or  entertain themselves the same or worship the same or share thesame family or social  customs. They were worlds a part. Scythian, Lightfoot saysrepresents the lowest  type of barbarian. It had become a name almost synonymouswith the slave class  because so many slaves were taken from the Scythian tribes aroundthe Black Sea. They were  destitute of education and refinement and were foreigners to thecity of Colossae.    Now how could Paul say that in the church ofColossae these differences  -- this significant range of racially, educationally andeconomically diverse  people -- how could he say that these deep differences wereovercome in unity?  Answer (verse 11b): Christ was all and in all. Christwas in them and he was  everything to them. That is, Christ was in them all by the HolySpirit (Rom. 8:9) through  faith, and Christ was their highest value -- he was supreme. Hewas so valuable and so  preeminent and so supreme that in relation to him and his will andhis presence, dividing  preferences defused. The grip of these preferences on our heartsis overcome by the  all-pervading supremacy of Christ. So at the end of FreshInitiative #2 we point to the  unifying element in the widening range of diverse people -- theywill be people who are  growing in their passion for the supremacy of God. If thatsupremacy does not exist in  your heart, the diversity will only be seen as a burden and not asa beauty.     Conclusion     So there are two words from God for us thismorning -- two Biblical  keys that unlock the treasure of an urban-suburban partnership: 1)do all that you do  (including deciding where to live and minister) in the name ofJesus; and 2) open your  heart to the truth that Christ is all and in all. Ask yourself asyou go this morning:  what kind of church, according to Colossians 3:11 will be the bestwitness to the truth  that Christ is all and in all -- or the best witness to the truththat here reigns a  passion for the supremacy of God in all things for all peoples?
