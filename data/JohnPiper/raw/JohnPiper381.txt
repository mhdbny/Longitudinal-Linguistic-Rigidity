       WE HAD BOLDNESS IN OUR GOD    (1 Thessalonians 2:1-12)        For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming      to you was not in vain, but after we had already suffered and      been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness      in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much      opposition. For our exhortation does not come from error or      impurity or by way of deceit; but just as we have been approved      by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as      pleasing men but God, who examines our hearts. For we never      came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext      for greed--God is witness--nor did we seek glory from men,      either from you or from others, even though as apostles of      Christ we might have asserted our authority. But we proved to      be gentle among you, as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her      own children. Having thus a fond affection for you, we were      well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but      also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us. For      you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working night      and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed      to you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and so is God, how      devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you      believers; just as you know how we were exhorting and      encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his      own children, so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the      God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.          
       This text teaches us why boldness is so necessary, and where   you get it, and what has to happen inside in order to be a bold   person. If you have a longing to be an influence for Christ and   his kingdom, and if you have a longing to be a free and authentic   person, then the answers to these three questions will ring as   relevant for you today as they did 2000 years ago. Because God has   never changed and human nature has not changed.        1. Why is boldness necessary?        Boldness is necessary because we don't want our lives to be   lived in vain. We don't want to come to the end of our lives--our   jobs, our ministries, our families--and say, "It's empty. Nothing   happened. There was no effect that mattered. It was all in vain."   We don't want to feel that or say that. And so boldness is   necessary to keep that from happening--so that our lives are not   in vain.       I see this in 1 Thessalonians 2:1-2 where Paul describes what   happened when he came from Philippi to Thessalonica, and lived and   ministered among the Thessalonians:        For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming      to you was not in vain,  &#91;why not?&#93; , but after      we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you      know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel      of God amid much opposition.         Paul's life in Thessalonica had not been in vain--even though   he stayed a relatively short time. And the reason his life there   was not empty and ineffective was because he had boldness in God,   and spoke the gospel with courage.       So what we learn is that the reason boldness is needed is that   it keeps our lives from being in vain. It makes our lives count.   It keeps us from coming to the end and saying, "Nothing happened.   There was no significance. I lived in vain."       To make this clear and sure let me point out something   remarkable about this text. It starts in verse 1 by referring to   what happened to the Thessalonians: "Our coming to you was not in   vain." That is, something happened to you. We did not minister   without effect. You were changed.       Now what I would expect after a statement like that is some   illustration of the effect of Paul's ministry in the lives of the   Thessalonians. Something like: "You know that our coming to you   was not in vain . . . for you turned from idols, and trusted   Christ as Lord and Savior, and you stopped lying and stealing and   hating, and you started caring about each other and sharing things   and loving your enemies and worshipping the true God."       But the amazing thing is that for 10 verses (2-11) there is not   one word about the effect of Paul's ministry on the Thessalonians   when he came. Instead the whole 10 verses describes Paul's life   and ministry. Ten things:       2a - We suffered and were mistreated in Philippi.       2c - We had boldness to speak the gospel to you.       3 - Our exhortation doesn't come from error or deceit.       4a - As we have been approved by God so we speak.       4b - We speak to please God not men.       5f - We did not flatter or covet or seek glory from men.       7f - We became gentle as a nurse and shared ourselves.       9 - We worked night and day not to burden you.       10 - We were devout, upright and blameless to you.       11f- We exhorted and encouraged as a father.       Now why is this? What is Paul saying? Why does he begin by   saying, "You know that our coming to you was not in vain," and   then tell the ten things about his ministry rather than its effect   on the Thessalonians.       There are at least two reasons I think. One is that Paul is   being slandered by his opponents in Thessalonica. We met them in   Acts 17. They were jealous of him and stirred up a mob and took   church leaders before the authorities. Paul is still concerned   about the persecution the church is experiencing (3:3-4).       Evidently Paul's enemies were saying that he was deceitful and   that he was only after the praise of men and that he was covetous   and wanted their money and that he used flattery to get it. So   Paul responds in verses 2-11 by reminding the Thessalonians of   what they really know about him. Six times he says "as you know"   or "you recall" or "you are witnesses" (vv. 1,2,5,9,10,11).       But Paul's concern here is not primarily with himself. The real   issue is that the discrediting of Paul and his message would also   discredit the authenticity of the Thessalonians' faith.       So what Paul is really doing is defending them and the reality   of their faith. That's the second reason why he talks so much   about his ministry. He says in verse 1, "You know that our coming   to you was not in vain," and then for ten verses he talks about   the authenticity of his own ministry. So what he is saying is,   "Our ministry to you was not without effect. You were changed. You   turned from idols. You were willing to suffer for Christ with joy.   So don't throw away your confidence when your opponents slander my   ministry and my life, remember the way it really was when I was   there. I was not flattering and covetous. I was bold in God and   risked my life to preach the gospel to you. I worked night and   day. I loved you like a nurse and like a father.       It was Paul's boldness in evangelizing that kept his life from   being in vain. And it will be our boldness that keeps our lives   from being bland and tasteless and empty and weak and   insignificant in the end.       You can confirm that we are on the right track here by   comparing what Paul says in 1:5-6.        ...our gospel did not come to you in word only,      but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full      conviction (in other words, it did not come in vain, as 2:1      says; then he goes on just as he does in 2:2ff with a reference      to his own ministry); just as you know what kind of men we      proved to be among you for your sake (namely, boldly preaching      in the face of danger; then he says explicitly how his ministry      affected them). You also became imitators of us and of the      Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy      of the Holy Spirit.         So Paul's boldness kept his life and ministry from being in   vain, because it produced in them a readiness to endure   tribulation with joy in the Holy Spirit.       So my answer to the first question (Why is boldness necessary?)   is that it keeps our lives from being in vain. It makes our lives   effective and fruitful and significant. It brings change into   people's lives and leads them on toward courage in Christ. And   nothing is more significant than leading people toward Christ and   his Kingdom.        2. Where do you get boldness?        Paul's answer is clear: You get it in God. Verse 2: "After we   had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know,   we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God   amid much opposition." We had boldness in our God.       Paul had suffered in Philippi. He had been publicly dragged   into the market of the city and charged with sedition because he   cast the demon out of a girl. And then he spent the night in jail.   Now in Thessalonica the mob was even more enraged and Paul barely   escaped by night to Berea. That was the setting for his ministry.   And in that setting he spoke the gospel courageously because he   had boldness in his God.       His life was given up to God. His life was hidden in God (Col.   3:3). He trusted God (2 Cor. 1:9). He hoped in God (Rom. 15:13).   The glory of God was more attractive to Paul than any earthly   comfort: "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are   not worthy to be compared to the glory that will be revealed to   us" (Rom. 8:18). God was so real, and so powerful, and so wise and   so utterly committed to doing all for Paul's good that he knew   nothing could separate him from the love of God--not death or life   or angels or principalities or things present or things to come or   powers or height or depth or anything else in all creation.       And so all his boldness was in God, and not in himself. And   that has been the source of all the boldness of all the martyrs.       Luther tells the story of two young Christian virgins who went   to prison and to death in the middle of the third century. Their   names were Agatha and Agnes. Luther says that they were very   confident and joyful.       They felt, as they also said aloud, as if they were      going to a wedding. Truly my dear daughter, if to you going to      prison and being beheaded is like going to a dance, you must in      truth have a heart, mind and courage different from those of      the world . . . Such courage assuredly is the work of the Holy      Spirit alone. (What Luther Says, I, p. 349).        Their courage was in God, not man. Not any human turn of   affairs. They lived on God. God was better than life.       Another example of what it means to have your boldness in God   is the Scots Covenanter Hugh Mackail. He was a Presbyterian in   Scotland in a bloody decade (1660's) when that was viewed as   seditious. He was tortured with what they called the boot to force   him to reveal other members of his band. His leg was inserted into   an iron case and then a wedge of iron was inserted between his   knee and the case snugly. When he refused to answer, the   executioner struck the wedge with a mallet. Eleven times the   mallet was struck until Mackail's leg was shattered.       He said, "I protest solemnly in the sight of God, I can say no   more, though all the joints in my body were in as great anguish as   my leg." The leg would not be much use to him anyway. He was   sentenced to be executed. His final words were famous and became   the cry of some of the later martyrs. Here's what he said. And   what these words illustrate is what Paul meant by having his   boldness in God.       Now I leave off to speak any more to creatures, and      turn my speech to Thee, O Lord. Now I begin my intercourse with      God, which shall never be broken off. Farewell, father and      mother, friends and relations! Farewell, the world and all      delights! Farewell, meat and drink! Farewell, sun, moon, and      stars! Welcome, god and Father! Welcome, sweet Lord Jesus, the      Mediator of the new covenant! Welcome, blessed Spirit of grace,      God of all consolation! Welcome, glory! Welcome, eternal life!      Welcome, death! (Men of the Covenant, pp. 150)        Hugh Mackail's life was not lived in vain. His death was not in   vain. Because he had boldness in his God. O may the Lord reveal   himself to us with such power and beauty at Bethlehem that we live   on him more than on anything else, and have boldness in our God.       The final question the text answers is:        3.
 "What has to happen inside for us to be bold   persons?"        Let me just mention two things that Paul emphasizes here.   Perhaps the two greatest obstacles to boldness are the love of   human acceptance and praise, and the love of the comforts and   securities that money can buy. What has to happen inside is for   the power of these two loves to be broken?       This had happened in Paul's life, and that is why he is so   bold. Verse 4b: "we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who   examines our hearts." Verse 6: "nor did we seek glory from men,   either from you or from others." And since he is free from the   need to please men and to seek glory and praise from friend and   foe alike, he is also free from the need to flatter and the need   to deceive. Verse 5: "We never came with flattering speech, as you   know."       The addiction to acceptance and recognition and praise that   lames so many people had been broken in Paul's life. He was free   and therefore he was bold.       But he was also free from the love of money and the securities   and comforts it can buy. Verse 5 again: "We never came with   flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed-- God   is witness." He was not after their money. It was of no interest   to him, and therefore he could speak with boldness without   measuring his words so as to make the most wealthy friends. In   fact verse 9 shows how Paul vigilantly guarded his financial   freedom: "You recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how   working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we   proclaimed to you the gospel of God."       He worked for a living so as to keep his hand clean of anyone's   money. He meant to be free and to be bold in his speech.       So at least these two things have to happen inside if we are to   be bold: we have to get free from the need of human acceptance and   praise, and we have to get free from the need for the comforts and   securities that money can buy. If we are free, we will be bold.       And the way to freedom is get your acceptance from God and get   your praise from God, and to get your comforts and security from   God. Verse 4 points to the key: "Just as we have been approved by   God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing   men but God."       Paul had his approval from God. He did not need human approval.   He had his future in God. So no human threats could stop his   courage.       We need boldness because without it our lives will be lived in   vain. And our boldness comes from God because only his approval   can break the power of craving for human approval, and only his   security and comfort can break the fear of losing human security   and comfort.       May the Lord make us like Hugh Mackail!       Farewell, father and mother, friends and relations!      Farewell, the world and all delights! Farewell, meat and drink!      Farewell, sun, moon, and stars!             Welcome, god and Father! Welcome, sweet Lord Jesus! Welcome,      blessed Spirit of grace! Welcome, glory! Welcome, eternal life!      Welcome, death!        Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
