       WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE?    "The Dead Will Be Raised Imperishable"    (1 Corinthians 15:50-58)        Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood      cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable      inherit the imperishable. Behold, I tell you a mystery; we      shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment,      in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the      trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,      and we shall be changed. For this perishable must put on the      imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. But when      this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this      mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the      saying that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory. "O      death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?"      The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but      thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord      Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast,      immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing      that your toil is not in vain in the Lord.         
       What we saw last week was that the apostle Paul had three   preferences about living and dying--in descending order. His first   preference was not to die at all but to be alive when Jesus   returns and instead of having to experience the separation of soul   and body, that he would experience the transformation of his   mortal body into an immortal one that would live with Christ for   ever in the kingdom.       He says this in 2 Corinthians 5:4, "While we are in this tent   (this temporary, mortal body), we groan, being burdened, because   we don't want to be unclothed (i.e. bodiless), but to be clothed   upon, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."   He does not want to be "unclothed" in the sense of being stripped   of his body. He wants his body to be swallowed up into the new   spiritual, immortal body at the last trumpet when Christ descends   from heaven to establish his kingdom and bring this age to a   close. That's Paul's first preference.       He knows he cannot know, let alone control, when Christ is   coming. So he is not sure if that first preference will come true.   So he expresses his second preference, namely, to die and be with   Christ. In 2 Corinthians 5:8 he says, "We are of good courage and   prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with   the Lord." Rather than groan here and bear the struggles and   sicknesses and sin of this life, he would rather die and be with   the Lord.       In Philippians 1:21 he says, "For to me, to live is Christ, and   to die is gain." He struggles with the need to stay here for the   sake of ministry against the longing to be done with the struggle   and enjoy the immediate presence of Jesus. He says in verse 23, "I   am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart   and be with Christ, for that is very much better." So his second   preference is this: if God wills for Christ to be delayed, then   Paul would rather go to be with him--if Christ does not yet come   to be with us--even if he must be stripped (even painfully   stripped) of his body.       The third preference is that, if God wills, and if it is better   for the people of the Lord and the glory of Christ, Paul is   willing to remain on the earth and to walk by faith and not by   sight. He is willing to postpone the deeper, more immediate   intimacy of seeing and being with Jesus if that's God's will. In 2   Corinthians 5:6-7 he says, "We are always of good courage and know   that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord,   for we walk by faith and not by sight." He said to the Philippians   that he would remain and continue with them all for the   advancement and joy of their faith (1:25). So his third preference   is to press on with the ministry and use his time on the earth to   advance faith and joy in others as far as he can.       Now we need to ask if we are out of step with these three   priorities. Do we set our minds on things that are above (Col.   3:2)? Do we live like our citizenship is in heaven and wait   eagerly for the Savior to return (Phil. 3:20)? Do we feel like   death would be more gain than loss (Phil. 1:21)? Are we so   entangled with this world that leaving it is the worse thing we   can think of?       When I pray for revival at Bethlehem and in the American Church   this is mainly what I have in mind: Lord pour out your Spirit in   such a way that your people desire Christ more than they desire   other things and other people. Revival is the inflaming of love to   Christ. Revival is not first miracles like healing or prophetic   utterances or speaking in tongues--as precious as those things are   (and I do mean precious!). It is possible to have the gift of   healing, and yet love health more than we love going to be with   Christ. It is possible to have the gift of prophecy, and yet crave   pornography more than you crave the second coming of Jesus. It is   possible to speak in tongues and love your gold rings and $1200   suits and $40,000 cars more than you believe that death is gain.       Which is why when I pray for revival I pray first for the most   radical thing: the utter devotion and allegiance of your hearts to   Christ. That you would love him so deeply and long for him so   passionately that his coming would be your great hope, and death   would be gain, and life would be for Christ and his kingdom.       To that end I want to focus here on the resurrection of our   bodies as those who are in Christ. I am talking to believers and I   am praying that unbelievers who hear me will turn from the   dead-end street of self-reliance and believe. "If you confess with   your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God   has raised him from the dead, you will be saved"--you will be   forgiven and after you die you will be raised to live with Christ   forever.       It seems to me that the hope of resurrection does not have the   same place of power and centrality for us today that it had for   the early Christians. And I think one of the reasons for that is   that we have a wrong view of the age to come. When we talk about   the future and the eternal state we tend to talk about heaven, and   heaven tends to imply a place far away characterized by   non-material, ethereal, disembodied spirits.       In other words, we tend to assume that the condition that the   departed saints are in NOW without their bodies is the way it will   always be. And we have encouraged ourselves so much with how good   it is for them now, we tend to forget that it is an imperfect   state and not the way it will be, nor the way Paul wanted it to be   for himself. Yes to die is gain, and yes, to be absent from the   body is to be at home with the Lord, but NO this is not our   ultimate hope. This is not the final state of our joy. This is not   our final or main comfort when we have lost loved ones who   believe.       For example, when the church in Thessalonica lost believing   loved ones, the main comfort that Paul offered was not that they   were with Christ (as true and wonderful as that is), but that they   would be raised bodily from the dead in time to participate   physically in the coming of Christ. He said (in 1 Thessalonians   4:15), "We who are alive, and remain until the coming of the Lord,   shall not precede those who have fallen asleep." "Precede"? What   does he mean by that? Precede in what sense?       The next verse answers the question: "For the Lord Himself will   descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,   and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise   first." "First!" Ah, there's the key. We will not precede them,   for they will rise first. You see how different that is from the   way we tend to comfort each other today. We would say, "We won't   precede them, because they are already with the Lord." We would be   thinking merely in terms of going to heaven. They got there first   by leaving their bodies behind.       But that is not what Paul says. As true as it is, that is not   the main hope or the main comfort for us Christians. What Paul   does say is this: We will not precede them because they will be   raised first. Not because they go to heaven first, which is true,   but because they will be raised first.       In other words, Paul is not thinking mainly of heaven far away   but of the glory of what happens here: their bodies will not be   left in the grave while we have the joy of physically meeting the   Lord in the air and welcoming him to his kingdom. They won't stay   in the grave while we are changed in the twinkling of an eye and   clothed with immortality. No, verse 17 says, "The dead in Christ   will rise first. Then (and only then) we who are alive and remain   shall be caught up together with them (not before them) in the   clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be   with the Lord."       And when he says, "with the Lord," he means with the one whom   (because of the resurrection) we can see and hear and touch with   our bodies--with eyes and ears and hands something like what we   have now. That is our hope--to be with the risen Christ with a   body like his glorious body. To know him in a form like his. Our   final destiny and our eternal state is not an ethereal,   disembodied state in a distant heaven. It is to reign with Christ   here on the renewed earth. This hope was so vibrant for the early   Christians that they comforted each other not mainly with the joys   of the disembodied state after death, but with the hope of   resurrection bodies (cf. Phil. 3:21).       Now look at today's text for one of the greatest descriptions   of that event.       Verse 50: "Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood   cannot inherit the kingdom of God." What does that mean? Is it a   wholesale denial of the bodily resurrection? No. "Flesh and blood"   simply means "human nature as we know it"--mortal, perishable,   sin-stained, decaying. Something so fragile and temporary as the   body we now have will not be the stuff of the eternal, durable,   unshakable, indestructible kingdom of God. But that doesn't mean   there won't be bodies.       It means that our bodies will be greater. They will be our   bodies, but they will be different and more wonderful. Verse 52:   "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for   the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,   and we shall be changed." When he says "the dead will be raised"   he means we--the dead--will be raised. If God meant to start all   over with no continuity between the body I have now and the one I   will have why would Paul say, "the dead will be raised"? Why would   he not say, "The dead will not be raised" (since they are   decomposed and their molecules are scattered into plants and   animals for a thousand miles) and so God will start from scratch   since there are no bodies to raise, and he will make totally new   bodies that have no connection with the old ones? He did not say   that, because it is not true.       He said two things; the dead will be raised (that teaches   continuity); and he said they will be changed--they will be made   imperishable and immortal. The old body will become a new body.   But it will be your body. God is able to do what we cannot   imagine. The resurrection is not described in terms of a totally   new creation but in terms of a change of the old creation. "We   shall all be changed" (v. 51b).       Look back now at verses 37-38. Paul compares the resurrection   to what happens to a seed when it goes into the ground. "That   which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare   grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else. But God gives it a   body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its   own." The point is that there is connection and continuity between   the simple seed and the beautiful plant. When you plant a wheat   seed, you don't get a barley plant. But on the other hand there is   difference. A plant is more beautiful than a seed.       Verses 42-44 applies the analogy to the resurrection body: "So   also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable   body, it is raised an imperishable body; it is sown in dishonor,   it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in   power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body."       I can hear someone say, "Why bother!" Let it go. Who needs it.   All that matters is the spiritual realities of love and joy and   peace and righteousness and goodness and truth. Why the big fuss   over arms and legs and hands and feet and hair and eyes and ears   and tongues? It seems so earthly.       We will see more of the answer in two weeks when we talk about   the new earth. But let me close with part of the answer today by   pointing you to 1 Corinthians 6:19-20. God did not create the   physical universe willy-nilly. He had a reason, namely, to add to   the ways his glory is externalized and made manifest. "The skies   are telling the glory of God." That's why he made them.       Your body fits into that same category of physical things that   God created for this reason. He is not going to back out on his   plan to glorify himself through human beings and human bodies. So   1 Corinthians 6:19-20 says, "Do you not know that your body is a   temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God,   and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a   price: therefore glorify God in your body."       Why does God go to all the trouble to dirty his hands to   reestablish your body and clothe it with immortality? Because his   Son paid the price of his life so that God could be glorified in   your body for ever and ever. "You were bought with a price,   therefore glorify God with your bodies." God will not dishonor the   work of his Son. That's why he will raise your body.       The sting of death is sin (15:56), but Christ bore the curse of   sin. The power of sin is the law (15:56), but Christ satisfied the   demands of the law. Therefore Paul cries out, "Thanks be to God   who gives the victory through Jesus Christ." When Christ died he   forgave sin and fulfilled the law and defeated death and obtained   not just our souls but also our bodies.       Therefore God will honor the work of his Son by raising your   body from the dead, and you will use your body to glorify him for   ever and ever. That is why you have a body now. And that is why it   will be raised imperishable.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
