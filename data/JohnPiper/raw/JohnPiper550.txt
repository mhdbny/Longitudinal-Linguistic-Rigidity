       To the Jew First and Also to the  Greek       (Romans 1:16)    
      For I am not ashamed of the gospel,    for it is the power of God for salvation    to everyone who believes,    to the Jew first and also to the Greek.      
       Everyone!       Paul has just used that  wonderful word everyone in Romans 1:16, The gospel is the power of God  unto salvation to  everyone  who believes. O, what an exhilarating word to  those of us in this room who feel that there is something about us that rules us out!  Wrong family, wrong background, wrong education, wrong language, wrong race, wrong  culture, wrong sexual preference, wrong moral track record. Then to hear the word,  Everyone   who believes. Everyone! One thing can rule you out: unbelief. Not trusting Jesus.  But nothing else has to. The good news that Christ died for our sins, and that he rose  from the dead to open eternal life, and that salvation is by grace through faith &#150;  all that is for  everyone who believes . Not just Jews and not just Gentiles and no  one race or social class or culture, but  everyone  who believes.    
       Then in What Ways Do the Jews  Have Priority?       So why then does he follow this  exhilarating word everyone with a word that seems to give priority to Jews?  The gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes,  to the  Jew first and also to the Greek . How does he mean, To the Jew first?  What kind of priority, what kind of firstness do they have? And why does he  say this? What effect does he want this to have on us?    To answer this let me suggest six ways that the Jews are first in  experiencing the salvation of God. And then we will look at a few ways that they are not  first. Finally we will see what effect this should have on us today.    First, then, how are the Jews first?    
       1. The Jews have a priority over Gentiles  as the chosen people of God       How do they have priority over  Gentiles? In Genesis 12, God chooses Abraham and his descendants freely from all the  peoples of the world to bless with his covenant and promise. Nehemiah 9:7 says, God  . . . chose Abram, and brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees. Then Deuteronomy  14:2 says about the whole Jewish people, The LORD has chosen you to be a people for  His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. And Amos  3:2 says, You only have I chosen among all the families of the earth. And here  in Romans 11:28-29, Paul says, From the standpoint of the gospel they [the Jews] are  enemies for your sake [you Gentiles], but from the standpoint of [election, or] God's  choice, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; for the gifts and the calling of God  are irrevocable.    The Jews have a priority over Greeks (that is, all Gentiles, by  implication) because of their special role as God&#146;s elect or chosen people. He set  his favor on them and set them apart from all the peoples. Freely! Not because of any  virtue or special value in them, but simply on the basis of his free choice: The  LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any  of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but because the LORD loved you and  kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers (Deuteronomy 7:7-8, See  The  Pleasures of God , pp. 128-133).    
                                       2. The Jews have a priority over Gentiles          as the guardians of God&#146;s special revelation, the Old Testament Scriptures                               In Romans 3:1, Paul asks our  question: What advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?  And he answers in verse 2, Great in every respect. First of all, that they were  entrusted with the oracles of God. In other words, God gave his special revelation  and promises to Israel by Moses and the prophets. Romans 9:4 puts it like this:  [They] are Israelites to whom belong . . . the covenants and the giving of the Law .  . . and the promises. All the great expressions and foreshadowings of the gospel of  salvation were given to the Jews in the Word of God, the Old Testament. So the Jews had  priority in having the Scriptures.    
                                       3. The Jews have a priority over the          Gentiles in that the Messiah himself, Jesus Christ, came first as a Jew to the Jews                               In Romans 9:5, Paul brings his  list of privileges to a climax with these words: From [the Jews] is the Christ  according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen. The Messiah,  Jesus, was a Jew, a Son of David (Romans 1:3). And he focused his earthly ministry on the  Jews. They had a priority in his work. In Matthew 10:5-6, Jesus said to the twelve  apostles as he sent them out during his life, Do not go in the   way of the  Gentiles, and do not enter any   city of the Samaritans; but rather go to the lost  sheep of the house of Israel. And in Matthew 15:24, Jesus said, I was sent  only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. So during his earthly life, Jesus was  focused on the Jews. They had priority in his ministry.    
                                       4. The Jews have a priority over the          Gentiles in that salvation is from the Jews                               These are the very words of  Jesus in John 4:22. Jesus says to the Samaritan woman at the well, You worship what  you do not know; we [Jews] worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.  This simply sums up all that we have seen so far. They are the chosen nation; the nation  with God&#146;s special revelation; and the nation with the Messiah, the Savior. So,  clearly, salvation is from the Jews.    Another way to see that salvation is from the Jews is found in Romans  11:17-24 where Paul compares the Jewish nation to an olive tree. He says that natural  branches are broken off and unnatural branches were grafted in, meaning that Jews by birth  were unbelieving and so cut off from the covenant of promise; and Gentiles who were  believing were grafted in and saved by the covenant of promise. Verses 17-18 are crucial  for us: If some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were  grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,  [then] do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that   it  is not you who supports the root, but the root supports   you. In other words,  salvation comes to us Gentiles from the root of God&#146;s covenant with the Jews. We are  simply grafted in like wild olive branches that have no historical claim at all on being  God&#146;s people. And God saves us by reckoning us children of Abraham by faith, as Paul  says in Galatians 3:7, It is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.    So Jews have priority because salvation is from the Jews.  All salvation is salvation through God&#146;s covenant with Abraham!    
                                       5. The Jews have a priority over the          Gentiles in that Paul evangelized Jews first when he brought the gospel to a new place                               For example, in Acts 13:46 Paul  and Barnabas are preaching in Antioch of Pisidia, and the Jews will not listen to the  gospel, so they say,  It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you  first;  since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold,  we are turning to the Gentiles. In other words, just as God chose Israel and  revealed himself to Israel and sent the Messiah and Savior to Israel so that salvation is  from Israel, it is fitting that in the spread of the Gospel to new places, the Jews hear  first of their Messiah and the good news of his salvation. So Jews have a priority in the  order of frontier missions when the gospel comes to a new place.    
                                       6. The Jews have a priority over the          Gentiles in final judgment and final blessing.                                In Romans 2:9-10, Paul says,  amazingly, There will be   tribulation and distress for every soul of man who  does evil,  of the Jew first and also of the Greek , but glory and honor and peace to  everyone who does good,  to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  In other  words, the priority that the Jews have, if it is rejected and squandered will result in a  priority in judgment. And if they are grateful for their priority and trust in the mercy  of their Messiah, then they will go first into the final blessing of God. There are  definite dangers in having this priority. From everyone who has been given much,  much will be required (Luke 12:48).    
    So when Paul says in Romans 1:16, The gospel is the power of God  unto salvation to everyone who believes,  to the Jew first and also to the Greek ,  we should call to mind these six ways that the Jews have a priority over the Gentiles.          They are the historic chosen people of God.       They are the guardians of God&#146;s special revelation, the Old    Testament Scriptures.       The Messiah and Savior, Jesus, comes to the world as a Jew to Jews.       Salvation is from the Jews, since everyone who is saved is saved by    being connected to the covenant with Abraham by faith.      The Jews are to be evangelized first when the gospel penetrates a new    region.       The Jews will enter first into final judgment and final blessing.      
          In What Ways Do the Jews Not Have  Priority?       Now before we ask why Paul says  this and what effect it should have on us, let&#146;s be sure we see several ways that the  Jews do not have priority. This is extremely important.     
       1. The Jews do not have priority in  righteousness or merit        Nor do Gentiles. We are on the  same footing. That is one of the main points of the first two chapters of Romans. Paul  concludes in Romans 3:9-10, What then? Are we [Jews] better than they [Gentiles]?  Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; as it  is written, &#145;THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE.&#146; He makes the same  point in Romans 3:22-23, There is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short  of the glory of God.    
       2. The Jews do not have priority in how  they are saved       They are saved exactly the way  Gentiles are. This is clear from Romans 3: 29-30, Is God the God   of Jews  only? Is He not the God   of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also . . . God who will  justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. And from  Romans 10:12, There is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is  Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; (13) for &#145;WHOEVER WILL CALL  ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.&#146; So neither Jews nor Gentiles have  priority in how they are saved: both are saved by faith in Christ, not in any ethnic or  religious distinctives.    
                                       3. The Jews do not have priority in          participation in God&#146;s covenant blessings                                The mystery of the gospel that  Paul preaches, he says, is that Gentiles now are full partners in the blessings of Jewish  salvation. Listen to Ephesians 2:12-13 and 18-19, You [Gentiles] were . . . separate  from Christ [the Messiah], excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the  covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus  you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ . . . (18) for  through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer  strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's  household. Again in Ephesians 3:4-6, When you read you can understand my  insight into the mystery of Christ, . . . that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow  members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus [the Messiah  Jesus] through the gospel.    So Jews do not have priority in participation in God&#146;s covenant  blessings. Gentiles are full fellow heirs of all the promises of God.    
       
    Why Did Paul Mention the Priority of the Jews?       So we come to a close with the  question: Why did Paul mention this priority of the Jews in Romans 1:16? The Gospel  is the power of God unto salvation,  to the Jew first and also to the Greek ?  What effect should it have?    Being influenced by Romans 11:17-32, I think the answer is that Paul  wants to humble both Jew and Greek and make them deeply aware that they depend entirely on  mercy, not on themselves or their tradition or ethnic connections. To the Gentiles he  says, in essence, salvation is of the Jews. You are not being saved by your Greek culture  &#150; or any other culture. You are being saved by a salvation that comes through the  despised Semitic people called the Jews. You do not support the root [of the  Abrahamic covenant], the root supports you. So do not boast over the branches  (Romans 11:18). We Gentiles are saved by becoming, as it were, spiritual Jews (Romans  2:28-29). This should humble us and strip us of any arrogance and boasting in any presumed  ethnic superiority. It also should vanquish anti-Semitism and fill us with zeal for  evangelism to Jews.    Similarly, Paul says to the Jews, your salvation is not your own. It is  God&#146;s and he gives it to whom he pleases. He can raise up from stones &#150; even  Gentile stones! &#150; children to Abraham (Matthew 3:9). The words also to the  Greek in Romans 1:16 would have been as offensive to the Jews as the words to  the Jew first were to the Gentiles. What they thought were Jewish prerogatives are,  in fact, shared by the lowliest Gentiles who believe. Both of us are being humbled. We  Gentiles must humble ourselves to be saved through a Jewish Messiah and a Jewish covenant.  Jews must humble themselves to receive unclean Gentiles into full covenant membership and  share all the blessings of the promise of Abraham.    The whole point is that God is the One who has mercy. Ethnicity is not  decisive here. There is no merit with him. We are all sinners. So the real emphasis falls  back on that wonderful word everyone that we started with: The Gospel is  the power of God to  everyone  who believes. So, whether Jew or Gentile,  believe! And receive the power of God to save you from your sins and guilt and death and  judgment and hell, and bring you home to ever-increasing joy in his presence forever and  ever.
