 August 9, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       OLYMPIC SPIRITUALITY    "How Then Shall We Run?" Part 2    (1 Corinthians 9:23-27)         And I do all things for the sake of the gospel,      that I may become a fellow partaker of it. Do you not know that      those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the      prize? Run in such a way that you may win. And everyone who      competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.      They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an      imperishable. Therefore I run in such a way, as not without      aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; but I buffet      my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have      preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.                What we saw from this text last week was that the Christian   life is like a race and like a fight. It is like running and   boxing. Even more important we saw that the way we run and the way   we fight make a difference in whether we have a share in the   gospel (v. 23; cf. Rom. 1:16), and whether we seize the prize of   the upward call of God in Christ Jesus (v. 24; cf. Phil. 3:14),   and whether we gain the crown of righteousness and life (v. 25;   cf. 2 Tim. 4:7-8), or whether we are disqualified from the race   (v. 27; cf. 2 Cor. 13:5).        In other words life is not a game with no lasting consequences.   The way we live our lives has eternal consequences. Life is a   proving ground where we prove who we are, whom we trust and what   we cherish. Eternal life, the upward call, the crown of   righteousness--all these hang on what our life says about who we   are, whom we trust and what we love.        Make no mistake here! Life is not a place for proving to God or   anybody your strength. Life is a place for proving whose strength   you trust--man's or God's. Life is not a place for proving the   power of your intelligence to know truth. It's a place for proving   the power of God's grace to show truth (Matt. 16:17). Life is not   a field for demonstrating the force of our will to make good   choices. It's a field for showing how the beauty of Christ takes   us captive and constrains us to choose and run for his glory.        The race of life has eternal consequences not because we are   saved by works, but because Christ has saved us from dead works to   serve the living and true God with Olympic passion (Heb.   9:14).        The race of life has eternal consequences not because grace is   nullified by the way we run, but because grace is verified by the   way we run. "By the grace of God I am what I am and his grace   toward me was not in vain, but I labored (I ran, I fought) more   exceedingly than all, yet it was not I but the grace of God which   was with me" (1 Cor. 15:10). Paul's running did not nullify the   purpose of grace; it verified the power of grace.        Eternal life hangs on the way we run and the way we fight not   because salvation is based on the merit of works, but because   faith without works is dead (James 2:26). Life is a proving ground   for whether faith is alive or dead--a proving ground for whom we   trust.        Let me drive this home with the way Paul describes how he runs   his race in Philippians 3:12. This is utterly crucial for how you   run for the prize of the upward call of God. Here Paul makes   explicit the relationship between running in order to obtain   (which makes life serious), and running because we have been   obtained (which makes life secure).        Not that I have already obtained it (the resurrection), or have   already become perfect, but I press on in order that I may lay   hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ   Jesus.        This is the utterly unique thing about the way a Christian   runner runs: we run not as though we see Jesus the judge at the   end merely scrutinizing while we rely on ourselves for strength;   but we run as those who have already been take hold of by Jesus   for the prize. We run to win the prize in the power of having been   taken hold of for the prize.        Hebrews 12:2-3 puts it like this:         Let us run with endurance the race that is set      before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus (in what sense?) as the      author and perfecter of our faith (as one who is involved in      the race creating and completing the race of faith), who for      the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,      an has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.         In other words we run to obtain eternal life (1 Tim. 6:12)   because we have already been obtained for eternal life. And our   running for it is the proof that we have been obtained for it.        Remember all of last spring's messages on the foundations of   full assurance. We have been obtained by God's sovereign election   before the foundation of the earth (Eph. 1:4). We have been   obtained by his predestination to adoption (Eph. 1:5). We have   been obtained by the reconciling death of his Son while we were   still sinners (Rom. 5:6-10). We have been obtained by regeneration   and effectual calling (1 Cor. 1:24; 1 John 5:1). We have been   obtained by the indwelling, sealing work of the Holy Spirit (Eph.   1:13; 4:30).        On the basis of this massive work of God in Christ to obtain us   apart from any initiatives of our own Paul now says here in 1   Corinthians 9:24, "Run that you may obtain the prize," namely the   prize for which you have been obtained. God has not saved you to   sit in the stands. God has not saved you to lie on the track. God   has not saved you sit on the edge of the pool with your feet in   the water. God has saved you to spend yourself for the glory of   his Son (Phil. 1:20). "You are not your own. You were bought with   a price. Glorify God in your body" (1 Cor. 6:19-20). The point of   salvation is to make the glory of God visible in the universe.        That's what this text is about. The running and fighting that   glorifies God--that demonstrates he is real and worthy and   precious and powerful and pure and loving and holy and satisfying.   Running and fighting are all about revealing who Christ is for us   and who we are in him and how precious the prize of eternal life   with him is to us.         So let's look briefly at how then we should   run.         First, Paul says in verse 24, "Do you not know that those who   run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in   such a way that you may win."        The point here is not that only one Christian wins the prize of   the upward call of God. As a matter of fact in the Christian race   one of the rules is that you must help others finish (Hebrews   3:13). Finishing the race is a community project. The point is not   that there is only one winner. The point is: run the way the   winner runs.        How does the winner run? He runs hard. He gives the race   everything he has. In another place Paul says, "Never flag in   zeal, be aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord" (Rom. 12:10). This   is the way we are to run in our service for Christ: with zeal and   fervent in the Spirit. Not lazy or idle or sluggish or   unconcerned.        When Jonathan Edwards was a student at Yale 270 years ago he   wrote seventy resolutions to stir him up to run his race. One of   them catches the spirit of verse 24. He wrote: "Resolved: to live   with all my might while I do live." "With all my might." It's the   practical outworking or the great commandment: "Love the Lord your   God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your   strength and with all your mind." "Whatever your hand finds to do,   do it with your might" (Eccl. 9:10).        The New Testament is full of ways to say this. "Strive to enter   by the narrow gate" (Luke 13:24). "Labor for the food that endures   to eternal life" (John 6:27). "Be steadfast, immovable always   abounding in the word of the Lord" (1 Cor. 15:58). "Let us not be   weary in well-doing for we shall reap if we do not faint" (Gal.   6:9). "Redeem the time for the days are evil" (Eph. 5:15). "Work   out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (Phil. 3:12).   "Christ gave himself to purify for himself a people zealous for   good deeds" (Tit. 2:14). "Show earnestness in realizing the full   assurance of hope to the end" (Heb. 6:11). "Love one another   earnestly from the heart" (1 Pet. 1:22).        Strive, labor, abound, be zealous, be earnest. Run like the   winner runs. Be done with half-heartedness and laziness and   luke-warmness. Christ has laid hold on you for this very thing.   You do not do it in your own strength. You strive and labor and   abound and love in the strength that he supplies so that in   everything he gets the glory (1 Pet. 4:11).        I think that's the gist of verse 24. It's a call for Christian   zeal. Now Paul gets more specific about the way a winner keeps   himself in condition for running.        Verse 25: "And everyone who competes in the games exercises   self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a   perishable wreath, but we an imperishable."        In Galatians 5:22 Paul tells us that this discipline of   self-control is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. So "self-control" is   not ultimately control by the self but by the Spirit. We   experience it usually as control by our own will, but in fact it   is God in us willing and working his own good pleasure (Phil.   3:13). The spiritual power of self-control happens when we believe   the promise of the word of God that greater joy will come through   self-denial, and when we trust the Spirit of God to give us   strength, and when we seek the glory of God as the outcome of our   victory.        What Paul is saying here is that there are impulses that we   have to control if we are going to run like a winner and receive   the crown of righteousness. The impulses we have to control are   the impulses to do things that will weaken our zeal for God: our   earnestness in prayer, our hunger for Scripture, our longing to   love, our passion for holiness.        The serious athlete doesn't ask about how to just get by in his   training. He asks about what will bring about maximum performance.   So the mature Christian asks, what will make me most useful for   the kingdom? What will stir up my zeal for God most? What will   intensify my earnestness in prayer? What will trigger more hunger   for God's word? What will strengthen my longing to love? What will   fan the flames of my passion for holiness?        And then the Christian takes note of all the impulses and all   the habits and practices of his life that weaken his zeal for God   and his joy of faith, and he sets about to take control of them   and put them out of his life.        Paul communicates the severity of this self-control in verses   26 and 27. Here he could hardly be more out of sync with   contemporary American life. ". . . I box in such a way as not   beating the air, but I buffet my body and make it my slave." The   body is not evil in itself. God created it. And he will raise it   from the dead to exist for ever. But the body is the base of   operations for sin, and sin uses it give rise to many impulses   that are destructive to spiritual life.        Therefore Paul says that when he exercises self-control it is   like boxing, and the enemy to be struck is the body, and when he   swings he does not miss and hit the air. He connects, and pommels   his body and makes it his slave. He will not be mastered by the   appetites and impulses and cravings and lethargy of the body. "The   body is for the Lord" (1 Cor. 6:13). So Paul means to make his   body serve the glory of the Lord.        This is exactly the spirit of Jesus when he said, If your eye   leads you to sin pluck it out or if your hand leads you to sin cut   it off. For it's better to enter eternal life blind in one eye and   maimed in one hand than to go to hell with both (Matt. 5:29-30).   Paul said, It's better to beat my body into submission than to be   disqualified from the race.        Now gouging out the eye does not overcome lust, and cutting off   the hand does not conquer theft or battery. The point is: fight   these impulses with that kind of seriousness. Both Jesus and Paul   mean: there are impulses that must be put to death. And the fight   to put them to death is like a boxing match with direct blows to   the face.        Now all this is tremendously relevant to the mission of this   church and your part in it. There are days of suffering ahead for   the confessing church in America. The price of faithfulness to   God's word in a hostile society and worldly church is increasing   almost daily. Not only that the price of taking the love of Christ   to the unreached peoples of the world in the midst of centuries of   Satanic darkness will not be without persecution and   martyrdom.        And one thing is certain: the human body will say NO to this   suffering. The body will say, "I will not pay the price!" Imagine   Paul ready to enter a hostile town with the gospel. He has been   beaten four times already with 39 lashes during his ministry. He   knows it could happen again. For a moment he wavers in his race   when the body says, "NO, I won't go. It's foolish to go. It's   painful to go. No!"        Then Paul calls to mind the promise that the one who loses his   life for Christ will find it. He calls on the Holy Spirit for   help. He considers the glory of God in the salvation of lost   sinners. And he turns as it were and hits his body right in the   face and says, "You be quiet, and submit yourself now as an   instrument of righteousness. You are going in there for Christ and   for his kingdom."        The same thing is true on a lesser level for how we care for   each other in this church. We will not love each other the way   Christ loved us until we learn to buffet the body the way he did   in the Garden of Gethsemane. His body cried out, "NO, I will not   be crucified!" And Jesus wrestled with his body to the point that   blood dropped from his face. And he made his body a servant of   love.        Unless we learn that kind of self-denial, in this day of   self-gratification, we will drift away from the painful pathway of   love and away from the costly course of missionary obedience, and   God will by-pass us on his way to triumph in the world.        But if we keep our eyes on the prize, if we exult in the truth   that Christ has already obtained us by his own blood, if we bank   on the promise of his help and his sustaining grace, then we will   run with power in the path of love. The mission will be completed   and people will see our good works and give glory to our Father in   heaven.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
