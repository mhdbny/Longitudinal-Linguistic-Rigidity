 March 8, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        GOD'S INVINCIBLE PURPOSE:    FOUNDATIONS FOR FULL ASSURANCE #2    "God Predestined Us Unto Sonship Through Jesus Christ"    (Ephesians 1:3-6)         Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus      Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual      blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him      before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and      blameless before him. He destined us in love to be his sons      through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to      the praise of his glorious grace which he freely bestowed on us      in the Beloved.             One of the saddest feelings in the world is the feeling that   your life is going nowhere. You're alive. But you feel like there   is no point in being alive. You get a little daydream--a little   flicker--of what it might be like to be a part of something really   great and really valuable, and what it might be like to have a   significant part in it. But then you wake up and everything looks   so small and insignificant and pitiful and out of the way and   unknown and pointless.        We were not made to live without a destiny. We were made to be   sustained by a meaningful, purposeful future. We were made to be   strengthened each day by this assurance, this confidence: that   what is happening in our lives today, no matter how mundane and   ordinary is a really significant step toward something great and   good and beautiful tomorrow.        When that connection breaks down--between my present life and a   great and good and beautiful destiny--I have three choices:    1) I can kill myself; or    2) I can numb myself (with alcohol or drugs or television or   pornography or romance novels or computers or frantic work or   frantic play); or    3) I can seek to reestablish the connection by finding what my   true destiny really is.        In a Nazi concentration camp in Hungary during the      second world war prisoners were forced to do nauseating work in      a sewage plant. But it was work; and something was      accomplished. Then the plant was destroyed by allied bombers.      So the Nazi officers arranged for the prisoners to shovel sand      into carts and drag it to the other end of the plant and dump      it. The next day they ordered them to shovel it back into the      carts and bring it to where they started. And so it went for      days.             Finally one old man began crying uncontrollably; the guards      hauled him away. Another screamed until he was beaten into      silence. Then a young man who had survived three years in the      camp darted away from the group. The guards shouted for him to      stop as he ran toward the electrified fence. The other      prisoners cried out, but it was too late; there was a blinding      flash and a terrible sizzling noise as smoke puffed from his      smoldering flesh. In the days that followed, dozens of the      prisoners went mad and ran from their work only to be shot by      guards or electrocuted by the fence. (Charles Colson, Kingdoms      in Conflict, p. 68)         We were made to be sustained by a purposeful future. We were   made to live in the assurance of a significant destiny.        I use the word destiny simply to connect this tremendous cry of   the human heart with the word predestination in today's text,   Ephesians 1:5. We began last week with verse 4: "God chose us in   him before the foundation of the world." This week we take up   verse 5: "God predestined us to sonship through Jesus Christ for   himself according to the good pleasure of his will."        I want to establish in your hearts this morning--you who   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and count him your Master and   Savior and Hope--I want to establish in your hearts an assured   destiny, a great and good and beautiful future, so that you don't   ever have to sob over empty days or scream over futility or throw   yourself on the wires because there is no future worth living for.   And the way I want to establish this destiny in your heart and   make it firm is by showing you two things in this text: the goal   of your destiny, and the ground of your destiny.        1. First, let's focus our attention on the goal of our destiny.   What are we destined for?        Verse 5 gives part of the answer: "God predestined us for   sonship." Our destiny from before the creation of the world was to   become the children of God.        The difference between predestination, which is mentioned in   verse 5, and election (or choosing) which is mentioned in verse 4,   is that election refers to God's freedom in choosing whom he will   predestine. Predestination refers to the goal or destiny for which   he chose them. Election is God's choosing whom he will, and   predestination is God's determination that they will become his   children.        When God chose you, he had a purpose, and so he predestined   that purpose to come about, namely that you would become a child   of God. That you would be part of his family. That you would   become an heir of all that God owns. That you would take on the   family likeness.        Your destiny to be God's children is mentioned in verse 5: "He   predestined us unto sonship." And one meaning of that, the family   likeness, is mentioned at the end of verse 4: "He chose us in him   before the foundation of the world (Why? For what destiny?) that   we should be holy and blameless before him in love." That's the   practical content of our destiny as God's children. We are   destined to take on the character of God our Father, the character   of holiness and blamelessness. That's our destiny.        Now notice where I am putting the little phrase "in love." I'm   making it a part of the end of verse 4, not the beginning of verse   5. My reading is found in the footnote in your Bible if you have   an RSV or NIV or an NASB. I'm following the KJV and the NRSV.        Here's the difference: I'm suggesting that verse four reads,   "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we   should be holy and blameless before him in love." "In love" goes   with holy and blameless and shows us what holiness is.        The other way of reading it puts "in love" with predestine in   verse 5 and says, "He predestined us in love unto sonship." Here   it refers to the love of God and tells us the way he predestined   us. The order of the words in Greek allows for both of these   readings.        Here's the main reason I go with the KJV and put it with verse   4 and make love the essence of our holiness. There is a parallel   in 1 Thessalonians 3:12-13 that goes like this:         May the Lord cause you to increase and abound in      love for one another, and for all men . . . so that he may      establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and      Father.         To me it is very remarkable that there are at least four   parallels with our text: the phrase "in love" ("may God cause you   to abound in love"), the combination of blamelessness and holiness   ("that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness"), the   phrase "before our God" ("holiness before our God") which   corresponds to the phrase "holy and blameless before him" in   Ephesians 1:4; and the reference to God as our Father just as we   have the focus on sonship in Ephesians 1:5.        All that says to me that just as love is the pathway to   holiness in 1 Thessalonians 3:12, so love is the pathway to   holiness in Ephesians 1:4. And so to live in love and to walk in   love is part of our destiny in Ephesians 1:4-5. God predestined us   to be his children and that means he destined us to be like   him--to be holy, to be blameless, that is to live in love to each   other and to all men.        John put it like this in 1 John 3:10, "By this the children of   God . . . are manifest . . . the one who does not love his brother   is not (a child) of God."        Your destiny is to be holy as your Father is holy, and that   means that your very essence is to love, for God, your Father, is   love (1 John 4:8). You are predestined to be like your Father.        But that's not your highest destiny. Your highest destiny is   described in verse 6. Why has God predestined us to sonship and   holiness and blamelessness and love? Verse 6: "To the praise of   the glory of his grace." Our holiness and our blamelessness and   our love and our sonship are not ends in themselves. They exist   for something greater: the praise of the glory of God's grace.        The ultimate goal of God in election and predestination is that   God might be praised for his glory. And the highest point of that   glory is grace. This is the final goal of our destiny. There is no   higher hope, no greater tomorrow, no more meaningful future, no   more worthy cause to live for, than to reflect and praise the   glory of God's grace for ever and ever.        The certainty of that destiny is grounded in the freedom of God   and the all-sufficient work of his Son Jesus.        2. So consider finally and briefly the ground of your destiny.   We've seen the goal. Now we look at the ground or foundation.        In verse 5 Paul says, "God predestined us to sonship through   Jesus Christ." Now to see what that means look at Ephesians   5:25-27.         25) Christ loved the church and gave himself for      her 26) that he might sanctify her  (that is "make her      holy")  . . . 27) that he might present the church to      himself in glory, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,      but that she might be holy and blameless.         The same two words from Ephesians 1:4! In other words, the   basis of your becoming holy and blameless before God is the loving   self-sacrifice of Christ on your behalf. The ground of our destiny   to be holy and blameless in love as God's children is the death of   Jesus in our place.        This means that when God chose you before the foundation of the   world, and predestined you to be his holy, blameless, loving   child, he also predestined his Son to die for you. The ground of   your destiny is not only that the Son of God died for you, but   that God planned it that way from the beginning. "He predestined   us to sonship through Jesus Christ." The end was predestined and   the means were predestined. Our holiness and Jesus' death.        But the ultimate ground, the deepest foundation, of our   becoming blameless and holy in love is not the death of God's Son.   Verse five points to a deeper ground, namely, the sovereign, free   will of God.        Verse 5 says, "God predestined us to sonship through Jesus   Christ for himself according to the good pleasure of his will."   The point of this text is to teach every believer this morning   that we owe our adoption into God's family to the "good pleasure   of God's will." We were chosen before the foundation of the world;   we were predestined to sonship and holiness and love not according   to what we had done, or according to what we understood, or   according to who our parents were, or according to our race, or   according to religious background, or according to where we lived   or according to our work or our status or wealth, or according to   what we willed. We were chosen and predestined according to the   good pleasure of God's will.        And the point of the double phrase (not just "according to his   will" but) "the good pleasure of his will" is meant to communicate   to us that God chose us and predestined us without any binding   reference point but his own sovereign will.        The sum of the matter is this: the ground of our predestination   is the good pleasure of God's will, the goal of our predestination   is the praise of God's glory, and the predestined connecting links   between the good pleasure of his will and the praise of his glory   are the death of his Son and the holiness of his people.        If you are trusting in Jesus Christ this morning the roots of   your life were planted in the eternal counsels of God, and the   branches of your life are growing into an absolutely sure and   glorious future with God. There are no unimportant days in your   life. You don't ever have to go to bed at night feeling that your   life is going nowhere. You don't ever have to give in to the lie   that you are not connected to an awesome purpose.        For God chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world   that you might be holy and blameless before him in love; he   predestined you to sonship through Jesus Christ for himself   according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the   glory of his grace. Amen.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
