  December 8, 1996 Bethlehem Baptist Church John Piper, Pastor      Our High Priest is The Son ofGod     Perfect Forever   (Hebrews 7:26-8:5)     For it was fitting that weshould have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separatedfrom sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27 who does not needdaily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for Hisown sins, and then for the sins of the people, because this He didonce for all when He offered up Himself. 28 For the Law appoints menas high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which cameafter the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever. 8:1 Now the mainpoint in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, whohas taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty inthe heavens, 2 a minister in the sanctuary, and in the truetabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. 3 For every high priestis appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; hence it isnecessary that this high priest also have something to offer. 4 Nowif He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there arethose who offer the gifts according to the Law; 5 who serve a copyand shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by Godwhen he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "SEE," He says, "THATYOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ONTHE MOUNTAIN."    Those last words in Hebrews 8:5("See that you make all things according to the pattern which wasshown you on the mountain") are a quote from Exodus 25:40. God isspeaking to Moses, and the point that this writer draws out is thatthe furnishings and the actions of the Old Testament tabernacle werecopies and shadows (notice those two words in verse 5a: "they serve a   copy    and    shadow    of heavenly things") -- symbols andpointers to a heavenly reality. When God gave Moses a pattern for thepriestly, sacrificial system, he didn't just make it up on the spotfor the Jewish people, he patterned it after glorious reality inheaven. We get a glimpse into God and his ways when we ponder thepriesthood of Israel.    And the point of the book ofHebrews is that Jesus Christ, God's Son, has not just come to fitinto the earthly system of priestly ministry as the best and finalhuman priest, but he has come        to fulfill and put an end to that systemand to orient all our attention on himself ministering for us inheaven   . The OldTestament tabernacle and priests and sacrifices were shadows. Now thereality has come and the shadows pass away.    Kids, suppose you and your momget separated in the grocery store, and you start to get scared andpanic and don't know which way to go, and you run to the end of anaisle, and just before you start to cry, you see a shadow on thefloor at the end of the aisle that looks just like your mom. It makesyou really happy and you feel hope. But which is better? Thehappiness of seeing the shadow, or having your mom step around thecorner and it's really her!?    That's the way it is when Jesuscomes to be our High Priest. That's what Christmas is. Christmas isthe replacement of shadows with the real thing.    Look at Hebrews 8:1-2. This isa kind of summary statement.    Now the main point in what hasbeen said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seatat the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, aminister in the sanctuary, and in the true tabernacle, which the Lordpitched, not man.    The point -- the main point ofit all -- is that the one priest who goes between us and God, andmakes us right with God, and prays for us to God is    not    an ordinary, weak, sinful, dying,priest like in the Old Testament days. He is the Son of God --strong, sinless, with an indestructible life. Not only that, he isnot ministering in an earthly tabernacle with all its limitations ofplace and size and wearing out and being moth-eaten and being soakedand burned and torn and stolen. No, verse 2 says that Christ isministering for us in a "true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, notman." This is the real thing in heaven. This is what cast on MountSinai a shadow that Moses copied.    According to verse 1, anothergreat thing about the reality which is greater than the shadow isthat our High Priest is seated at the right hand of the Majesty inheaven. No Old Testament priest could ever say that. Jesus dealsdirectly with God the Father. He has a place of honor beside God. Heis loved and respected infinitely by God. He is constantly with God.This is not shadow reality like curtains and bowls and tables andcandles and robes and tassels and sheep and goats and pigeons. Thisis final, ultimate reality: God and his Son interacting in love andholiness for our eternal salvation. Ultimate reality is the Personsof the Godhead in relationship, dealing with each other concerninghow their majesty and holiness and love and justice and goodness andtruth shall be manifest in a redeemed people.    Now add to this the last versesof chapter 7. The writer wants us to marvel at the superiority of thepriesthood of Jesus over the Old Testament priesthood that he came toreplace. Notice five superiorities.    Five Superiorities ofthe Priesthood of Jesus    First,   Jesus is sinless. Verse 26: We have aHigh Priest who is "holy, innocent, undefiled, separated fromsinners, exalted above the heavens." No other priest could ever saythat. They were all sinful, like you and me. But not Jesus. He wastempted but never yielded to the point of sin.    Second,   because he was sinless, he didn't haveto offer sacrifices for himself, but instead could offer himself as asacrifice. Verse 27: "He does not need daily, like those highpriests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins, and then forthe sins of the people, because this He did once for all when Heoffered up Himself."    So he was radically differentfrom the previous priests. They had sins of their own that had to bedealt with first, and then never in a million years would it haveentered their heads that they could actually    be    the sacrifice for the sins of others.But Jesus changed all that: He needed no sacrifice for himself, butbecame a sacrifice in himself.    Which leads to the   third   superiority: his sacrifice of himselfwas "once for all." You see that at the end of verse 27, "This He did   once forall    when He offered upHimself." This is a great word (   ephapax   ) -- "once for all." The effect it hasis to make Jesus the center of history. Every work of God's grace inhistory before the sacrifice of Christ looked forward to the death ofChrist for its foundation. And every work of God's grace since thesacrifice of Christ looks back to the death of Christ for itsfoundation. Christ is the center of the history of grace. There is nograce without him. Grace was planned from all eternity, but notwithout Jesus Christ at the center and his death as the foundation.Paul says in 2 Timothy 1: 9 that God's "grace . . . was granted us inChrist Jesus from all eternity."    The   fourth   superiority of Christ over all otherpriests is that they were appointed by the Law in their weakness, buthe was appointed by a divine oath as a perfect Son. Verse 28: "TheLaw appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of theoath, which came after the Law, appoints       a Son." The oath he's referring to isthe oath in Psalm 110:4, "The LORD has    sworn    and will not change His mind, Thou arta priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." The oathcomes after the law and, in fact, points already in the Old Testamentto the end of the Law as a ritual system.    The oath is spoken to theMessiah. In Psalm 110:1, David says, "The Lord [God] said to my Lord[Messiah], sit at my right hand." So the final High Priest is theMessiah, the Son of God, in the order of Melchizedek, not Levi orAaron, and is installed by an oath, not by the Law, which is passingaway.    The   fifth   superiority of Christ over all otherpriests is that his ministry is forever. At the end of verse 28: Theoath "   appoints   a Son, made perfect   forever   ." Jesus never dies. He never has to bereplaced. He has an indestructible life. He will outlive all hisfoes. He will be there for us long after everyone we depend on isdead. Sometimes children fret that Mommy or Daddy won't live to takecare of them. And sometimes we parents fret that we won't be alive totake care of our children (especially when at age 50 we adopt a babygirl). But that is why this truth is so precious. The priesthood ofJesus -- the one who prays for us, as we saw last week, and the onewho is sympathetic with us, as we saw in Hebrews 4:15 -- this hasbeen perfected forever. Not for a decade or a century or amillennium. But forever. To that we look when we think about howuncertain our lives are.    The great and overarching pointof this text at the end of chapter 7 and the beginning of chapter 8is that we have a great High Priest, Jesus Christ, who came into theworld as the Son of God, lived a sinless life, offered himself as aperfect sacrifice for the sins of his people, rose to everlastinglife at the right hand of the majesty of God, and there loves us andprays for us and bids us draw near to God through him. He did notcome to fit into the old system of priestly sacrifices. He came tofulfill them and end them.    He is the reality; they werethe shadow and the copy of the reality. When the Reality comes, theshadow passes away.    Now let me draw out someimplications of this for the life of worship. The High Priesthood ofJesus -- the coming of the reality instead of the shadow -- fulfillsand brings to an end the physical center of Old Testament worship,the tabernacle and the temple. It fulfills and brings to an end theofficial priesthood. It fulfills and brings to an end the sacrificialofferings. It fulfills and brings to an end the dietary laws. Itfulfills and brings to an end the priestly vestments. It fulfills andbrings to an end the seasonal acts of atonement andreconciliation.   What this means, in essence, isthat the entire worship life of the Old Testament has been radicallyrefocused onto Jesus himself and has become a radically   spiritual   thing, as opposed to an   external    thing. The external is still important,but now the spiritual is so radically pervasive that virtually all ofexternal life, not just church life, is the expression of worship."Present your bodies as living sacrifices which is your reasonableservice of worship" (Romans 12:1). That's all the time andeverywhere. "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, doall to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31) -- all the time,everywhere. The money that the Philippians sent to Paul he says in4:18 was "a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing toGod."    In the New Testament, all thefocus is on the reality of the glory of Christ, not the shadow andcopy of religious objects and forms. It is stunning how indifferentthe New Testament is to such things: there is no authorization in theNew Testament for worship buildings, or worship dress, or worshiptimes, or worship music, or worship liturgy or worship size orthirty-five-minute sermons, or Advent poems or choirs or instrumentsor candles. In fact, the act of getting together as Christians in theNew Testament to sing or pray or hear the word of God is never evencalled worship. I wonder if we do not distort the Biblical meaning of"worship" by using the word almost entirely for an event for whichthe New Testament    never    uses the word.    But all of this makes us veryfree and, perhaps, very frightened. Free to find place and time anddress and size and music and elements and objects that help us orientradically toward the supremacy of God in Christ. And frightened,perhaps, because almost every worship tradition we have is culturallyshaped rather than Biblically commanded. The command is a radicalconnection of love and trust and obedience to Jesus Christ in all oflife.    There's a reason for thisradical spirituality of worship in the New Testament. And the reasonis this. The New Testament is a missionary document. The message ofthis book is meant to be carried to every people on earth andincarnated in every culture in the world. And that is why our HighPriest came and ended tabernacle, and sacrifices and feasts andvestments and dietary laws and circumcision and priesthood. The OldTestament was mainly a come-and-see religion. The New Testament ismainly a go-and-tell religion. And to make that possible, the Son ofGod has not abolished worship, but made it the kind of radicallyspiritual engagement with God in Christ that can and must happen inevery culture on the earth. Worship is not trivialized in the NewTestament, but intensified, deepened, and made the radical fuel andgoal of all missions.    The frightening freedom ofworship in the New Testament is a missionary mandate. We must notlock this gospel treasure in any cultural straitjacket. Rather let usfind the place, the time, the dress, the forms, the music thatkindles and carries a passion for the supremacy of God in all things.And may our communion with the living God be so real and the Spiritof God so powerfully present that the heart of what we do becomes thejoy of all the peoples we are called to reach.
