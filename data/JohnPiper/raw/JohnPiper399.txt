  February 6, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       Preparing For the Discipline of a Vocational Minister       Introduction:        There is an appointed time foreverything. And there      is a time for every event under heaven--A time to give birth,      and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to uproot what      is planted. A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to tear      down, and time o build up. A time to weep, and a time to laugh;      A time to mourn, and a time to dance. A time to throw stones,      and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace, and a time to      shun embracing. A time to search, and a time to give up as      lost; A time to keep, and a time to throw away. A time to tear      apart, and a time to sew together; A time to be silent, and a      time to speak. A time to love, and a time to hate; A time for      war, and a time for peace (Ecclesiastes 3:1-8).         We are entering a time to mourn, a time to weep, a time to   search, and it seems a time to tear apart. One text that captures   such a time as this is Joel 2:15-17:        Blow a trumpet in Zion, consecrate afast, proclaim a      solemn assembly, gather the people, sanctify the congregation,      assemble the elders, gather the children and the nursing      infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his room and the bride      out of her bridal chamber. Let the priests, the Lord's      ministers, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them      say, "Spare Thy people, O Lord, and do not make Thine      inheritance a reproach, a byword among the nations. why should      they among the peoples say, 'Where is theirGod?'"         &#91;At this point in the sermon, Pastor John took a moment to   address the children. He told them this little poem in order to   help them process what was taking place:       When things don't go the way they should God always makes it   turn for good.       He then gave five stories about how God made good things come   from what seemed to be bad circumstances:       1. A splinter in your finger has to be removed, but it hurts to   have it taken out. Sometimes things that hurt actually help us to   get better.       2. The story of Joseph in Genesis: "You meant it for evil but   God meant it for good."       3. John Bunyan's imprisonment and John Owen's "failure" to get   him released actually lead to the writing of A Pilgrim's Progress.       4. A recent personal experience from Pastor John's life.       5. The cross of Christ: betrayal, denial and sin actually led   to our salvation.&#93;       Public Reproof for Public Ministers       I would simply like to develop a principle concerning public   ministry and the sins of public ministers.        But when Cephas came to Antioch, Iopposed him to his      face, because he stood condemned. For prior to the coming of      certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but      when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof,      fearing the party of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews      joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was      carried away by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that they were      not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to      Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like      the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel      the Gentiles to live like Jews? (Galatians 2:11-14)         "All" here means the "gentiles" (v. 12) and the "party of the   circumcision" (v. 12) and "the rest of the Jews" (v. 13). Peter   was a very public figure and his behavior was having public   ramifications. It was hurting the community. Therefore Paul's   reproof was similarly public. "In the presence of all" (v. 14).       Principle:       Therefore the reproof and correction of a public minister   extends as far as his influence may carry the harm his sin. The   more public the figure, the more public the reproof. The more   widespread the influence the more widespread the correction. The   more extensive the potential harm of his sin the more extensive   the censure.       Application:       Elders and deacons and other authorized public ministers of the   congregation are public ministers with the Biblical expectation   that their ministry will be largely by example. For example:       Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder   and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of   the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God among   you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily,   according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with   eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your   charge, but proving to be examples to the flock (1 Peter 5:1-3).       Public ministers lead by their lives. This cannot be limited   only to their righteousness and not to their sin. It would be   entirely hypocritical if a public minister said: I lead by my   example: all my good deeds I show; and all my bad deeds I hide.   That is not an example; that is a counterfeit.       If we are going to say that our successes and their rewards are   needful for the people to see; we must also say that our failures   and their consequences are needful for the people to see. We lead   by example not just when we succeed, but also when we fail. The   one is attended with honor and we teach that others should   imitate. The other is attended with dishonor and we teach that   others should fear.       John Calvin and the reformers wrestled as much as anyone with   these things. Calvin lays down this principle:       Just as &#91;elders&#93; show the way to others by the example   of an honorable life, so, if they go wrong, it is right that   severe discipline should be exercised against them as an example   to all. For why should greater forbearance be shown to men whose   faults do more serious harm than those of other men? (Commentary   on 1 Timothy 5:20, p. 264)       We leaders cannot have our cake and eat it too. If we embrace   the burden of public influence by example (as the Bible says we   must) we must accept that burden of influence when our example   goes wrong, and needs to be reproved. We are not honorable if we   say: I will accept the privilege of leading people by example as   long as I am praised, but I will not accept the burden of leading   people by example when I am reproved. I will let my successes   teach publicly, but not my failures.        Remember those who led you, who spoke theword of God      to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate      their faith (Hebrews 13:7).         If you are to consider the faith and conduct of your leaders, I   cannot believe you are to look the other way when our behavior   falls short. The price of public leadership is public reproof for   sins that call our fitness for public office into question.        But we request of you, brethren, that youappreciate      those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you      in the Lord and give you instruction, and that you esteem them      very highly in love because of their work (1 Thessalonians      5:12-13).         We leaders cannot accept this public esteem while we walk in   the light; but then reject public reproof when we walk in the   dark. Public ministerial leadership means we are to lead by our   lives. That means we receive respect and esteem when we live   uprightly and we receive dishonor and shame when we walk in sin.   We simply cannot say: "I will be public when I am good and I will   be private when I am bad."        And do not participate in the unfruitfuldeeds of      darkness, but instead even expose them; (Ephesians5:11)         And the exposing is in proportion to the seriousness of the sin   and the extent of public influence in the sinner.       We know this also from the qualifications for elder listed in 1   Tim. 3. This list of qualifications implies that the church must   judge the fitness of men for the eldership. But if it is Biblical   that the fitness of an elder for official public leadership be   exposed, it must also be Biblical that the unfitness of an elder   for official public leadership be exposed.       For example, it says        An overseer, then, must be abovereproach, (1 Timothy      3:2)         No elder can say with integrity: I accept the approval of this   church for my qualities of being above reproach, but I do not   accept the reproof of this church when I have fallen into   reproach. You can't with integrity say: I am an influential,   public figure as long as I do things that will get me praise; but   I will not endure public scrutiny when I do things that will et me   criticism.       Principle:       Therefore the reproof and correction of a public minister   extends as far as his influence may carry the harm his sin. The   more public the figure, the more public the reproof. The more   widespread the influence the more widespread the correction. The   more extensive the potential harm of his sin the more extensive   the censure.
