       IF MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU . . .    (John 15:7)        If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask      whatever you will and it shall be done for you.              
        What is the most urgent need in the church of the Western world   today? That's the question that Don Carson poses at the beginning   of his new book, A Call to Spiritual Reformation. It's a good   question to pose at the beginning of the new year.       Is it the need for purity in sexual matters, he asks, in a   culture obsessed with sex at almost every turn? Is it integrity   and generosity in the financial arena where the "raw worship of   Mammon has become so bold, so outrageous, so pervasive in the   Western world during the last ten years that many of us are   willing to do almost anything--including sacrificing our   children--provided we can buy more" (p. 13).       Is the most urgent need more evangelism and church growth--when   careful studies show that perhaps 4% of those who make decisions   at major crusades are persevering with Christ five years later,   and when the increase of church attendance is accompanied by no   increase in holiness?       Is the most urgent need disciplined, biblical thinking and   strong biblical scholarship, when many students and faculty in   seminaries and colleges and universities have an extraordinarily   shallow knowledge of God, in spite of all their academic work?       Carson does not belittle any of these needs, but says, "There   is a sense in which these urgent needs are merely symptomatic of a   far more serious lack. The one thing we most urgently need in   Western Christendom is a deeper knowledge of God. We need to know   God better" (p. 15).       Then he says that prayer is one of the foundational steps in   knowing God--"spiritual, persistent, biblically-minded prayer."       He thinks that we have become so good at other things that we   have forgotten how to pray: "We have learned how to organize,   build institutions, publish books, insert ourselves into the   media, develop evangelistic strategies, and administer   discipleship programs, but we have forgotten how to pray" (p. 16).       Several years ago at a North American seminary, fifty students   planning to go overseas in ministry for the summer were   interviewed for their suitability. Only three--six percent--could   testify to regular quiet times of reading the Bible and devoting   themselves to prayer. We assume that our pastors and missionaries   are the models--we would be shocked I am afraid.       J.I. Packer wrote about his own pilgrimage in prayer and   commented, "I believe that prayer is the measure of the man,   spiritually, in a way that nothing else is, so that how we pray is   as important a question as we can ever face" (My Path of Prayer,   David Hanes, ed., Worthing, West Sussex: Henry E. Walter, 1981, p.   56).       Carson's aim in his book is to see our prayer life transformed   and, through that, our experiential knowledge of God deepened. He   realizes that the main reforming power is the Word of God, and so   he designs his book as a meditation on the prayers of Paul.       There is good Biblical reason for this approach. It's the same   Biblical reason that I have chosen the two sermons for prayer week   to be based on John 15:7. Jesus said to his disciples,        If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask      whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.         The text has two halves, one for this Sunday and one for next   Sunday. The first half is, "If you abide in me and my words abide   in you." And the second half is, "ask whatever you will, and it   shall be done for you." The first half is the condition for the   second half. There is an "if - then" connection. If you abide in   me and my words abide in you . . . THEN ask and it will be done."   The condition for powerful praying is that we abide in Jesus and   his words abide in us.       So this week I want to talk about the condition, the IF   clause--especially the words of Jesus abiding in us--and next week   about the result, the THEN clause--praying with powerful effect.       I think Carson is right that the great need of the hour is to   know God more deeply and personally and more biblically. And I   agree that study and thinking is crucial, but that without   personal communion with God in prayer we will not really know him,   but only know about him.       And so I want Bethlehem to be utterly devoted to   prayer--private prayer, small group prayer, congregational prayer,   extraordinary times of prayer, prayer and fasting, adoring prayer,   repenting prayer, requesting prayer, prevailing prayer, healing   prayer, authentic prayer. If this is the soil in which Biblical   truth is continually preached and taught, then we will know   God--not just know about God.       And this is not just my desire for Bethlehem. It is God's   desire. I felt this afresh a couple weeks ago when read these   words of God in Isaiah 56:        &#91;The foreigners&#93; I will bring to my holy      mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their      burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my      altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all      peoples.         God means for the house of his dwelling to be a house of prayer   for all peoples. And he means to make his people--including   foreigners who trust him--joyful in his house of prayer. He means   for prayer to be mainly a joyful business.       So on top of everything else that comes with a deeper life of   prayer, you can add joy--"I will make them joyful in my house of   prayer."       According to our text, John 15:7, if we are to become what God   wants us to be in our praying, we must let the words of Jesus   abide in us. "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask   whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you."       The words of Jesus must abide in us if our prayers are to be   effective. What then does this mean, and how are we do it? What   should your plan for 1993 include if you want your prayers to be   what Jesus describes in John 15:7?       The best way to see what it means for the words of Jesus to   abide in us is to look at verses 4 and 5 in this chapter. In verse   4 Jesus says, "Abide in me, and I in you." The result will be that   you bear fruit. In verse 5 Jesus says, "I am the vine, you are the   branches; he who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit."   Again we see the pair: Abide in me and I in you. We abide in Jesus   and he abides in us. Both are connected to fruit-bearing.       Then in verse 7 in stead of using the pair, "If you abide in me   and I in you," Jesus says, "If you abide in me, and my words abide   in you." I think the point of this change is to let us see   practically how we let Jesus abide in us, namely, by letting his   words abide in us. "If you abide in me, and I abide in you," is   explained partly by, "If you abide in me, and my words abide in   you." We let Jesus abide in us, as we let his words abide in us.       But this also sheds light on what it means for the words of   Jesus to abide in us. Letting the words of Jesus abide in us means   letting Jesus abide in us speaking. It means that we welcome Jesus   into our lives and make room for him to live, not as a silent   guest with no opinions or commands, but as an authoritative guest   whose opinions matter more to us than anyone else's and whose   commands are the law of our life.       Christ abiding in us is interchangeable with his words abiding   in us because Christ never comes without his authoritative views   on things. To have him abiding is to have all his views abiding in   us. If he abides his views abide. If he abides, his priorities   abide. If he abides his principles abide. If he abides his   promises abide. If he abides his commandments abide. In short, if   when Christ abides in us, his words abide in us.       What that means for letting the words of Jesus abide in us is   that we do not just read the Bible, and do not just memorize and   meditate on the Bible, and do not just listen to preaching and   teaching from the Bible. It means that we seek the words of Jesus   as living words--words that come not in the abstract but come from   the heart and on the lips of a living Person whom we love more   than any other person in the world.       Letting the words of Jesus abide in us is not like memorizing   axioms and theorems in geometry. It's not even like mulling over   wise saying from ancient teachers. It is not like that because   Jesus is alive today, and he does not mean for thinking about his   words to replace fellowship with him. He means for musing on his   words to BE fellowship with him.       And so letting the words of Jesus abide in you means taking   whatever steps are necessary to keep the living voice of Jesus   speaking with you through the words that he spoke in Scripture. It   is a spiritually intentional act of relating to a living person   when you take his words into your mind. It is meditating on a   saying like, "I came that they might have life, and have it   abundantly," and thanking Jesus for coming and praising him as a   life giver, and believing that his intention for you is abundant   life, and asking him to fulfil his good will in you.       When the words of Jesus abide in us we hear them and respond to   them as living words from the mouth of a living God to whom we   must respond in faith or unbelief, and obedience or disobedience.   When Jesus says, "If my words abide in you," he means, "If I abide   in you speaking all my will." He means, "If my words are received   and remembered and believed and pondered as the living words of a   living and present Lord in your life."       How then do you do this? What practical steps can you take to   let the word of Jesus abide in you? Let me suggest eight ideas.       (1) Prepare a way to remind yourself repeatedly of the reasons   that meditating on the Scriptures is good for you.       Jesus said in John 15:11, "These things I have spoken to you   that my joy may be in you and that your joy might be full."   Letting the words of Jesus abide in you will make your joy full.   Remembering this will give needed incentive to do what needs to be   done.       A couple other ways to remind yourself of the reasons that it   is good for you would be to tear out the part of the worship   folder that quotes Psalm 19:7-11 and put it in your wallet. Also   read pp. 119-125 in Desiring God for the reasons collected there.       (2) Plan a place and a time when you will read the Bible and   think about it each day. Put it on the calendar as an appointment.   It is a meeting with a Person just as much as any other   appointment you might make.       Carson gives as the first reason we do not pray as we ought   this one: "Much praying is not done because we do not plan to   pray. We do not drift into spiritual life . . . We will not grow   in prayer unless we plan to pray. That means self-consciously   setting aside time to do nothing but pray" (p. 19).       (3) Decide ahead of time how you will read the Bible.       Coming to the appointed time and having no idea where to dip   into the word often makes us feel weak and unreal. Take up a plan   like one of the two that we are offering you at the prayer table   and decide to use it or to use something else.       (4) Memorize verses or paragraphs or chapters. Memorizing is   hard work. But it gives the greatest satisfaction and the greatest   power and the greatest comfort. It also will have the greatest   effect on your prayers, helping you pray according to the will and   Spirit of God.       When you memorize, the word of God is not just there in the   crisis when you need it, it is there again and again shaping your   thinking and your will. Ask yourself, of all the spiritually   minded people who seem to walk most consistently with God and be   in tune with God's Spirit, are they not all oozing scripture? This   is no coincidence. Memorizing scripture is one of the surest   routes to going deep with God and having power in prayer.       (5) Take periodic retreats and saturate yourself with the Bible   until you feel that you are lifted into the presence of the Lord   in a remarkable way so that your prayers are uncluttered by   worldly thinking.       Wesley Duewel says that sometimes he takes retreats and seeks   to quiet his heart completely until he senses only the presence   and will of God. To do that he says, "I have at times read as many   as fifty chapters from God's Word before I was completely alone   with God. But on some of those occasions I received such   unexpected guidance that my life has been greatly benefited" (Let   God Guide You Daily, p. 77).       (6) Keep a journal and write out your thoughts as you meditate   on the scripture.       Writing is a way of seeing that is deeper and sharper than most   other ways. We see more when we write than when we just read.       I know not how the light is shed,       nor understand this lens.       I only know that there are eyes       In pencils and in pens.       You don't have to use the journal every time or every day. But   do it sometimes and you will soon see the fruit, so that I won't   need to convince you.       (7) Read great Christian writers who know God deeply and   saturate their writing with the Bible and take you deep into its   spirit.       They are like reading the Bible through the mind and heart of   great knowers and lovers of God. Don't let long books daunt you.   Finishing the book does not matter. Growing by it matters. But   finishing is not as hard as you might think.       Suppose you read slowly like I do--about the same speed as you   speak--200 words a minute. If you read 15 minutes a day for one   year (just 15 minutes, say just before supper, or just before   bed), you will read 5,475 minutes in the year. Multiply that by   200 words a minute and you get 1,095,000 words that you would read   in a year. Now the average book has about 360 words per page   (that's what Carson's book has). So you would have read 360 words   into 1,095,000, or 3,041 pages in one year. That's 13 books the   size of Carson's book, or reading his in 21 days. All that in 15   minutes a day.       The point is: the words of Jesus will abide in you more deeply   and more powerfully if you give yourself to some serious reading   of great books that are saturated with Scripture.       (8) Finally, keep the living Person of Jesus before you as you   read the Bible, and consciously remind yourself repeatedly that   these are the words not of a dead teacher, but of the living   Christ, who is as near as your own breathing and who is infinitely   powerful.       As you enter Prayer Week 1993, remember the words of Jesus: "If   you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will   and it shall be done for you."
