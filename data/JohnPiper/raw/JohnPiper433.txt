    February 19, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     A FAST FOR WATERS THAT DO NOT FAIL (PART2)   (Isaiah 58:1-12)           1 Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raiseyour voice like a trumpet,    And declare to My people their transgression, And to the houseof Jacob their sins. 2 Yet    they seek Me day by day, and delight to know My ways, As anation that has done    righteousness, And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God.They ask Me for just    decisions, They delight in the nearness of God. 3 Why havewe fasted and Thou dost    not see? Why have we humbled ourselves and Thou dost notnotice?
 Behold, on    the day of your fast you find your desire, And drive hard allyour workers. 4 Behold, you    fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist.You do not fast like you    do today to make your voice heard on high. 5 Is it a fast likethis which I choose, a day    for a man to humble himself? Is it for bowing one's head like areed, And for spreading    out sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast,even an acceptable day to the    Lord? 6 Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the bondsof wickedness, To undo    the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free, Andbreak every yoke? 7 Is it not    to divide your bread with the hungry, And bring the homelesspoor into the house; When you    see the naked, to cover him; And not to hide yourself from yourown flesh? 8 Then your    light will break out like the dawn, And your recovery willspeedily spring forth; And your    righteousness will go before you; The glory of the Lord will beyour rear guard. 9 Then    you will call, and the Lord will answer; You will cry, and Hewill say, Here I    am. If you remove the yoke from your midst, The pointingof the finger, and speaking    wickedness, 10 And if you give yourself to the hungry, Andsatisfy the desire of the    afflicted, Then your light will rise in darkness, And your gloomwill become like midday.    11 And the Lord will continually guide you, And satisfy yourdesire in scorched places,    And give strength to your bones; And you will be like a wateredgarden, And like a spring    of water whose waters do not fail. 12 And those from among youwill rebuild the ancient    ruins; You will raise up the age-old foundations; And you willbe called the repairer of    the breach, The restorer of the streets in which todwell.            Introduction and Review     What we saw last week from verses 1-5 was thathow you treat people on  Monday is the test of the authenticity of your fasting on Sunday.They cry out to God in  verse 3, Why have we fasted and Thou dost not see? AndGod answers at the end  of the verse, Behold, on the day of your fast you find yourdesire, and drive hard  all your workers. And God asks in verse 5, Is it afast like this which I  choose? Meaning: such a fast is unacceptable. God even makessport of such a fasting  when he says in verse 5, Is it for bowing one's head like areed? The gestures  of this self-inflicted religion are no more spiritual than a bentreed in the swamp.     Why is this fasting unacceptable to God?What&#146;s wrong with it?  What&#146;s wrong with it is that it left the sin in their livesuntouched. The only  authentic fasting is fasting that includes a spiritual attackagainst our own sin.  Whatever else we fast for we must fast for our own holiness. Wecannot fast for  anything   with authenticity while living in known sin. The onlyauthentic praying is praying  that includes an attack against our own sin. The only authenticworship is worship that  includes at least an implicit attack against our own sin.     And what this text emphasizes is that ouraction on Monday is the test  of whether we really are intent on attacking the sin in our lives,and therefore whether  our fasting and praying and worshipping on Sunday is authentic. Ifwe are sincere on  Sunday in our prayerful opposition to the sin of our lives, thenwe will fight it on  Monday with action. We may not always succeed as fully as we wouldlike, but we will fight  our sin on Monday if our fasting was true on Sunday.     If there&#146;s an unresolved pocket of sin inyour life and you are  fasting about something else -- some blessing, some healing --God&#146;s going to come to  you and say, The fast that I choose is for THAT sin to bedealt with. The way  he does that here is very striking. Verse 5 says they were fastingand humbling  themselves. That word humbling also meansafflicting. So  they were afflicting themselves with hunger. But God says thatthis is not the fast that  he chooses. And in verse 10 he takes the very wordshungry and  afflicted and says that there are some hungry andafflicted people he is very  concerned about, namely, the ones who are not choosing to behungry and afflicted but are  hungry and afflicted because the religious people oppress theminstead of feeding them.  Verse 10: And if you give yourself to the hungry, Andsatisfy the desire of the  afflicted . . .[instead of oppressing them]     In other words, your fasting and self-affliction on Sunday is not  really an attack on your own sin of injustice and hard-heartedness. Because if it were,  your action on Monday would be to alleviate the hunger andaffliction of the poor,  especially your own workers. There is a great irony here that Godwants us to see. The  poor are hungry and afflicted, verse 10 says. These well-to-doreligious people are also  hungry and afflicted -- with fasting. But what are they fastingfor? Is their fasting  first a battle against their own sin? -- the sin of driving hardall their workers? The  sin of putting a heavy yoke on the back of the poor? The sin ofneglecting the needs of  the poor for clothing and housing? No. That is not what they arefasting against. Their  behavior -- on Monday -- proves it. So God comes to them and says,The fast that I  choose is not that you religiously make yourselves hungry andafflicted, but that you make  the poor less hungry and afflicted. If you want to fight sin bytaking your bread away  from your own mouth, then put it in the mouth of the poor. Then wewill see if you are  really fasting for righteousness&#146; sake.    When we are living in sin -- say the sin ifhard-heartedness or deceit  or injustice -- the fast which God chooses is not a religiouscovering of this sin, but a  direct frontal assault against this sin. For these people fastingwas not a fight against  the besetting sin of their lives; it was a camouflage. If theymake themselves hunger a  little bit and afflict themselves, maybe it won&#146;t matter somuch that they are  indifferent to the hunger and the affliction of the poor. So Godcomes and says, I  test your hearts. Go without bread for the sake of the poor. Giveit to them. That&#146;s  the fast I choose.     God&#146;s Chosen Fast: A Doctor&#146;sPrescription not a Job  Description     Then what God does in verses 6-12 isdescribe what is involved in  living out this fast and what the spectacular rewards are forliving this way. You recall  that Jesus said, Your heavenly Father who sees in secretwill reward you. Well here  are some of the kinds of things God promises to do for those whodo this kind of fasting  (cf. Psalm 41:1-3).    First let&#146;s look at the description of thefasting itself, and  then at the promises of God for those who live this way.Don&#146;t make the mistake of  thinking that this is a job description that God had given hispeople to show them how to  earn wages from him. There is no earning going on here. The God ofIsaiah cannot be  negotiated with. He is sovereign and free and gives graciously tothose who trust him.  Isaiah 30:15 says, For thus the Lord God, the Holy One ofIsrael, has said, &#145;In  repentance and rest you shall be saved, in quietness and trust isyour  strength.&#146; The strength to do the fast God calls us todo does not come from  us. It comes from God. And it comes through trusting him.     What God calls the people to do is not a job description,  but a  Doctor&#146;s  prescription.  You can see that in verse 8where it says that if you  act this way -- if you follow the Doctor&#146;s prescription offasting -- Your  recovery -- your healing -- will speedily spring forth. Ifyou trust the Doctor, and  show this by obeying his instructions, you will get well. Sodon&#146;t think that you are  going to earn anything from God. Trust his sovereign grace andfollow his prescription,  and you will be mightily blessed. But it will never occur to youto think that you have  earned or merited anything.     What the Doctor Prescribes     Let&#146;s look at the prescription -- thefast that God chooses.  Beginning in verse 6: Is not this the fast I choose,          To loosen the bonds of wickedness,            To undo the bands of the yoke,            And to let the oppressed go free,            And break every yoke?             Is it not to divide your bread with thehungry,             And bring the homeless poor into thehouse;             When you see the naked, to cover him;             And not to hide yourself from your ownflesh?            Then in verses 8 and 9a come the promises ofwhat will happen if you  trust the Doctor&#146;s fasting directions. But skip over that fora moment and go to the  rest of the prescription in verse 9b-10a.          If you remove the yoke from your midst,            The pointing of the finger,            And speaking wickedness            And if you give yourself to the hungry,            And satisfy the desire of the afflicted .. .            That&#146;s the Doctor&#146;s prescription.That&#146;s the fast that  the Doctor prescribes for the patient Israel who is sick with thedisease of hypocrisy and  hard-heartedness against the poor.    There are 13 components but they seem to fallinto about seven  categories. I give these as a call on the life of our church. Wemust discover how to join  in this prescription of fasting.      1. In this fasting, we are called tolift the burden of  bondage.          






 Fiveof these components  call for freedom. Verse 6:                   To loosen the bonds of wickedness,                To undo the bands of the yoke,                And to let the oppressed go free,                And break every yoke?                     






Verse 9:                    If you remove the yoke from yourmidst . . .                   Bonds, bands, yoke, oppression, yoke, yoke. . .The point here is: live  to free people not burden them. Jesus said in Luke 11:46,Woe to you lawyers as  well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, while youyourselves will not even  touch the burdens with one of your fingers. We are called tofree people from  burdens, not oppress them with burdens.      2 In this fasting we are called tofeed the hungry.           Verse 7: Is [this fast] not to divideyour bread with the    hungry?             3. In this fasting we are called tohouse the homeless.           Verse 7: And bring the homeless poorinto the house.         4. In this fasting we are called toclothe the naked.           Verse 7: When you see the naked, tocover him.         5. In this fasting we are called tobe sympathetic; to feel  what others feel because we have the same flesh theydo.      Verse 7: And not to hide yourselffrom your own flesh?  The thought may be the same as Hebrews 13:3, Remember theprisoners, as though in  prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since youyourselves also are in the  body. You have the same flesh they do. So put yourself intheir place and feel what  they feel.      6. In this fasting we are called toput away gestures and  words that show raw contempt for other people.      Verse 9: Remove . . . the pointing ofthe finger (literally,  the sending of the finger, which may be a lot closerto our crude giving  someone the finger than it is to merely pointing atsomeone); and [remove] speaking  wickedness. So don&#146;t speak and don&#146;t gesture inways that show callous  contempt for others.      7. Finally, in this fasting we arecalled not just to give  food, but to give ourselves -- our souls -- and not just tosatisfy the stomach of the  poor, but the soul of the afflicted.      Verse 10: And if you give yourself (=soul) to the hungry,  and satisfy the desire (literally: soul) of the afflicted . .. This is one of the  messages of this weekend with John Hayes: ministry to the poor isnot merely giving  things. It is giving self. It&#146;s not just relief. It&#146;srelationship.     The Promised Results of Following theDoctor&#146;s Prescription     Now, if we trust God enough to follow himin this prescribed seven  point fast, what will happen in our lives and in our church? Thesepromises are worthy of  about seven sermons. But I will mention the categories and praythat God will give you a  heart to meditate on them long enough to see the riches.      1. If we fast like this the darknessin our life will become  light:       Verse 8          Then your light will break out like thedawn (verse 8).        Verse 10 (at the end):          Then your light will rise in darkness,       And your gloom will become like midday.       Do you want light in your life instead ofgloom? Look to the gracious  resources of God -- listen to your Doctor -- and pour your selfout for another person in  need.      2. If we follow this fasting therewill be physical  strengthening.      Verse 8: And your recovery willspeedily spring forth . .  . Verse 11: And [he will] give strength to yourbones. Who knows how  much weakness is in us because we may not be pouring our energyinto the weakness of  others?      3. If we follow this fasting Godwill be in front of us and  behind us and in the midst of us with righteousness andglory.      Verse 8, at the end: And yourrighteousness will go before  you; the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. So Godwill be in front of you  with righteousness and behind you with his glory. Verse 9:Then you will call, and  the Lord will answer; You will cry, and He will say, 'Here Iam.&#146; Whenever the  role is called, he always says, Here! When we aredoing what his Son did -- in  the power that the Son gives -- becoming poor that othersmight become rich,  (2 Cor. 8:9) then God moves in on us and behind us and in front ofus and surrounds us  with omnipotent love and protection and care.      4. If we follow this fasting, Godpromises to guide us  continually.      Verse 11: And the Lord willcontinually guide you. O  what a precious promise that is for us now as a church and aMaster Planning Team. I  wonder how much confusion and uncertainty there may be in some ofour lives that comes  from the neglect of ministry to the poor? It seems the Lord giveshis most intimate  guidance to those bent on giving themselves to the needs of others-- especially the poor.      5. If we follow this fasting, Hewill satisfy your soul.      Verse 11: And [he will] satisfy yourdesire [literally: your  soul] in scorched places. Our souls are meant to besatisfied in God. But we have  learned again and again that this satisfaction in God comes toconsummation when we extend  our satisfaction in him to others. Pouring ourselves out for thepoor is the path of  deepest satisfaction.      6. If we follow this fasting, Godwill make you a watered  garden with springs that do not fail.      Verse 11, at the end: And you will belike a watered garden,  and like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. It is aparadoxical spiritual  principle in Scripture: as you pour yourself out you become full.As you give away you get  more. When you are watered with God&#146;s grace you do not merelybecome a wet, moist,  living garden; you also become a spring.     This promise comes to its fulfillment in theNew Testament when Jesus  used this verse in John 7:38, He who believes in Me, as theScripture said, 'From  his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.' [a springof waters that does not  fail] 39 But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believedin Him were to  receive. So you can see that trusting Jesus is the issue:He who believes in  me. . . &#145; The Spirit bestirs himself most fully when we byfaith give ourselves with  Jesus in the path of love and mercy toward the destitute.      7. Finally, if we follow thisfasting, that is, if we give  ourselves to the poor, God will restore the ruins of his city --and his people.      Verse 12: And those from among youwill rebuild the ancient  ruins; you will raise up the age-old foundations; and you will becalled the repairer of  the breach, the restorer of the streets in which to dwell.    Let&#146;s trust the Great Physician -- theLord, our healer.  Let&#146;s accept the fast that he has prescribed for us. It willmean light and healing  and guidance and refreshment and restoration and resourcefulness --and all this with God  himself before us and behind us and in the midst of us. And itdoesn&#146;t get any better  than that.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
