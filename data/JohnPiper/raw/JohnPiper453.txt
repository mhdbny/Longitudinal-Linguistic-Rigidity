      October 8, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church   Volume 3    Through our Lord Jesus Christ in thepower of the Holy  Spirit   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document   The Spiritual Dynamic (Part 1)       Introduction: Review of Bethlehem&#146;sMission     This is the third in a series of messageson Bethlehem&#146;s new  Mission  and Vision Statement  developed over the last year by theElders and the Master  Planning Team. In invite you to take a copy and review with me theMission of our church  which I preached on last Sunday:                   Bethlehem&#146;s mission is         to spread a passion for the supremacy of God        in all things for the joy of allpeoples.               That is why we exist.    At the heart of this mission is the connectionbetween the supremacy of  God and joy. We believe that because God is supremely great -- inpower and wisdom and  justice and goodness and truth and love -- because he is supremelygreat and glorious,  therefore   to know him and have fellowship with him is the only source ofsupreme JOY. Psalm 95  says -- and watch the fiery logic of heaven here --           Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms. For  the LORD is a    great God, and a great King above all gods.         Don&#146;t miss this word for here(Hebrew  kiy ) --  on it hangs our entire mission. If it falls, we fall. Let usshout joyfully to Him  with psalms -- that&#146;s our commitment to be joyful andto spread joy in  God&#146;s supremacy to all the peoples --  For  theLORD is a great God, and a  great King above all gods -- above all! In other words theLord is supreme. To  condense it to the basics: Rejoice in God because God is supreme.The supremacy of God is  the ground of our joy.    And because of that, we also believe our joyshows the supremacy of  God&#146;s value. If his greatness is the basis of our joy, thenour joy is the evidence  of his greatness. If the supremacy of God is the Rock of your joy,then the depth of your  joy is the revelation of your Rock. So we love to say,      God is most glorified in us when we are mostsatisfied in him.      Our joy in him magnifies the glory of hissupremacy over us.    So our mission   is to spread a passion forthe supremacy of God in  all things for the joy of all peoples  .     Bethlehem&#146;s Spiritual Dynamic     Now to carry this through in life for thenext five or fifty years  -- to hold to it and love it and pursue it through good times andhard times year in and  year out -- is going to take a robust, rugged, strong  SpiritualDynamic . So on page  two of the Mission Booklet you find  The Spiritual Dynamicthat drives our  mission.           What we mean by spiritual dynamicis the way the power of    the Holy Spirit helps us do our mission. Dynamiccomes from the Greek word  dunamis     which means power (dynamite), and spiritual in theNew Testament means coming    from and shaped by the Holy Spirit. So our spiritualdynamic is the unleashing    of the power of the Holy Spirit. Our deep conviction is that ourMission is undoable    without the Holy Spirit. And if we  could  do it withouthim, we may as well close up    shop and eat drink and be merry, because what&#146;s the pointof doing church if it    doesn&#146;t take God to do it? We would just be another humanorganization. There are    better ways to spend our lives, Paul says, if this is a merehuman affair on the way to    the grave.        The Four Agents of Bethlehem&#146;sSpiritual Dynamic     So we are going to spend four weeks on thisSpiritual Dynamic. As  we read it I want you to be watching for four things. As it beginsit simply restates the  Mission: that we exist to join God the Father in magnifyingthe supremacy of his  glory -- that&#146;s our mission. But then comes theDynamic: how shall this come to  pass? As I read it, notice the four agents of the dynamic -- fourpersons are involved in  the coming of the power of the Spirit to help us magnify thesupremacy of God. Who are  they and what do they do? That&#146;s our question today and inthe next weeks.     The Spiritual Dynamic     We join God the Father     in magnifying the supremacy of his glory    through our Lord Jesus Christ,     in the power of the Holy Spirit    by treasuring all that God is,    loving all whom He loves,         praying for all His purposes,       meditating on all His Word,       sustained by all His Grace.       There are four agents. You can see them behindfour prepositions.  THROUGH   our Lord  Jesus Christ ,  IN  the power of the Holy Spirit , and  BY   Treasuring, loving, praying, and meditating ( you  arethe third agent) and  sustained  BY  all  His  (= God&#146;s) grace. We aregoing to focus on the  first two of these today, but let me summarize what each agentdoes in bringing the power  of the Holy Spirit to help us live our mission.    First, when we say that we magnify thesupremacy of God&#146;s glory  through our Lord Jesus Christ the most basic thing wemean is that the death  and resurrection of Jesus Christ  released  the Holy Spiritto help us glorify God.  We&#146;ll say how in a moment.    Second, when we say that we magnify thesupremacy of God&#146;s glory  in the power of the Holy Spirit we mean that theSpirit himself  applies  his  power to us directly. Paul says in Romans 8:9, You are . . .in the Spirit, if  indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. The Holy Spirit isgiven to all who trust in  Christ and he applies to us in our every day lives the power thatwas released by Christ  when he died.    Third, when we say that we magnify thesupremacy of God&#146;s glory  by treasuring all that he is, loving all whom he loves,praying for all his  purposes, and meditating on all his Word, we mean that   you  are an agent of  the power of the Spirit. There is a way that you appropriate  it and a way that you  live it out.    Finally (fourth) when we say that we magnifythe supremacy of  God&#146;s glory sustained by all his grace, we meanthat God, the Father  himself, and  upholds  this whole dynamic by the sheerfreedom of his sovereign  grace. He sent the Son to die and rise and   release  the power of the Spirit;  he sent the Spirit to   apply   his own power to uspersonally -- baptizing,  filling, sanctifying, guiding; he enables us by his grace to  appropriate   the  power of the Spirit -- by treasuring and loving and praying andmeditating.    So the four agents of the spiritual dynamic are:       Christ  who  releases  the power,                    the  Spirit  who  applies  the power,                             you , the Christian, who  appropriates  thepower,                                    and  God the Father  who  sustains  it allby his grace.                            This is what we want to unpack in the nextthree weeks. But this  morning I want to say a word about the first two agents and howthey work in our Spiritual  Dynamic. Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.     1. Jesus     First, Jesus. There is no hope of ourglorifying God voluntarily  apart from the death of Jesus Christ for our sin. Why is that? Thereason is that, apart  from the death of Jesus, God could not justly pour out on usguilty sinners the glorious  blessing of the Holy Spirit. It would be a great injustice andblasphemy for God to honor  so highly those who have so deeply dishonored him. But apart fromthe enabling work of the  Holy Spirit no one has the desire to glorify him by delighting inhim. So how will anyone  come to delight in God and honor him? When Jesus died for oursins, he absorbed the wrath  of God against us, and vindicated the justice of God in mercy andreleased God to pour out  the blessing of the Spirit on sinners, without injustice orblasphemy.    Let me show you this from two passages, bothfrom Romans 8. First, from  Romans 8:3-4:          For what the Law could not do, weak as itwas through the flesh,    God  did : sending His own Son in the likeness ofsinful flesh and  as    an offering  for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, 4in order that the    requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walkaccording to the flesh,    but according to the Spirit.        What this text says is that the law of the OldTestament commanded us  to love -- the just requirement of the law -- but had no power toenable us to love. Verse  3 says it was weak through the flesh. It couldn&#146;t bring aboutwhat it commanded. Real  obedience, real love, requires the Holy Spirit -- love is thefruit of the Spirit, not a  mere work of law.    What was in the way? Why was the Holy Spiritnot poured out more fully  sooner to enable people to fulfill the just requirement of thelaw? Our tremendous guilt  was in the way. Paul says that something had to happen first,namely, the death of Christ  for sin. Before the  Spirit  of God could come in fullness toovercome the  power   of sin, the  Son  of God had to come to overcome the guilt  of our sin. So when  sin was condemned in the cross (v. 3) -- when Christ bore ourcondemnation -- Paul says,  then the Holy Spirit could be more fully poured out so that thejust requirement of the  law would be fulfilled in our lives when we walk by the Spirit.    The power of our Spiritual Dynamic comes through  our Lord Jesus  because he shed his blood to take away the wrath of God from us sothat God could justly  and freely pour out his loving power on us by his Spirit.    Let&#146;s see this in another great text inRomans 8, namely, verse  32:                   He who did not spare His own Son,        but delivered Him up for us all,        how will He not also with Him        freely give us all things?               Do you see the glorious logic of heaven here?Something has to happen  before God can freely give us all things. That is, something hasto happen before God can  pour out the fullness of the Holy Spirit on sinners like us. Whathas to happen is the  offering of his Son in our place so that our sins are forgiven andthe justice of  God&#146;s wrath is satisfied, and he is free to bless us for thesake of his Son.    So here at Bethlehem, let us raise the bannerof the blood of Christ  over every single thing we do. When we say, We join God theFather in magnifying the  supremacy of his glory THROUGH our Lord Jesus Christ,let&#146;s know what we mean.  We mean that because Jesus died for us our sins are forgiven, ourguilt is removed, the  curse of the law is taken away, the wrath of God is absorbed inthe suffering of Jesus,  and God now has only one will toward us: doing us good. And allthat good comes through  the release of the Holy Spirit into our lives. This is ourSpiritual Dynamic -- the power  of the Holy Spirit released by the sin-bearing, wrath-removingdeath of Jesus. Without  this none of us would or could magnify God&#146;s glory byenjoying him for ever.     2. The Holy Spirit     Which leads us in closing to the phrase inour Spiritual Dynamic,  in the power of the Holy Spirit.           We join God the Father            in magnifying the supremacy of His glory            through our Lord Jesus Christ,            in the power of the Holy Spirit            What I want to do here is stress with all mymight the utter importance  of this, and plead with you to pray for the outpouring of the HolySpirit in power upon  our church in these days. I personally think we are on the brinkof something really  remarkable in our church and in our city. And everything hangs onthe Spiritual Dynamic --  on the power of the Holy Spirit, released by the guilt-removingwork of Christ and applied  to us by the Spirit himself.    I want you to see that every aspect of thismission and its Fresh  Initiatives depend on the dynamic of the Holy Spirit. Turnwith me to page 3. These  are the fresh initiatives. These are the adjustments in ourtrajectory. How these get  fleshed out in the years to come will make a tremendous differencein the way we fulfill  our mission. So notice with me that every one of them is dependenton the power of the  Holy Spirit, according to the New Testament.      1.    The value ofrelationships.   We will  take new practical steps to develop an atmosphere where personal,deepening, supportive,  faith-building   relationships of love   are highlyvalued as expressions of our  passion for the supremacy of God&#146;s love.    Where do relationships of love comefrom? Galatians 5:22  says, The fruit of the   Spirit   is love.The key to love is the  work of the Spirit -- the dynamic of the Spirit. Wemust be born of the  Spirit. We must be indwelt by the Spirit. We must be led by thespirit. We must be filled  with the Spirit. We must. Seek him with me. Plead for his fullnessand power.     2. 


  Urban-Suburban Partnership.    We will strive to forge a mutually enriching urban-suburban partnership, in which  a significant range of racially, educationally, and economicallydiverse people feel at  home, as they grow in their passion for the supremacy of God.    Where does this kind of unity come from? How dowe rise above  suspicions and judgmentalism and pride and fault-finding andaccusations? Paul gives the  answer in a simple phrase in Ephesians 4:3. Be diligent topreserve the unity  of  the Spirit  in the bond of peace. Unity of the Spirit. Ifthis partnership  happens it will be owing to the dynamic of the Holy Spirit. Wemust have him. Seek him  with me. Plead for his fullness and power.     3 .


  Interracial reconciliation.    Against the rising spirit of indifference, alienation andhostility in our land,  we will embrace the supremacy of God&#146;s love to take new stepspersonally and  corporately toward racial reconciliation, expressed visibly in ourcommunity and in our  church.    Where does this kind of reconciling power comefrom? Paul gives the  answer in Ephesians 2:18 as he addresses the ethnic hostilitiesbetween Jew and Gentile --  and if anything was relevant and crucial today in America it isthis -- from the cover of  TIME to Larry King Live to the front page of the  Tribune the issue is racial  tension. The real cultural issue of the O. J. Simpson trial willbe what it reveals about  how far we have to go, and how far we have fallen from MartinLuther King&#146;s dream.  Paul says in Ephesians 2:18,           Through Christ we both  (Jew andGentile, black and white, red,    brown, yellow)  have our access  in one Spirit  to theFather.        It&#146;s the Spirit. He is our hope for such agreat work. We must  have him. Seek him with me. Plead for his fullness and power.      4. 


 Diversity in God-centered  worship.   Sunday morning worship is a corporate expressionof our passion for the  supremacy of God. We sense God&#146;s leading to develop freshexpressions of this passion  that 1) allow for a more focused and free lingering of love in thepresence of the Lord;  2) reflect musically the diversity of our congregation and ourmetropolitan culture; and  3) interweave the values of intense God-centeredness and morepersonal ministry to each  other in the power of the Holy Spirit.    In Romans 15:6 Paul pleads that with oneaccord you may with one  voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.How will we ever do that?  Philippians 3:3 points the way with a simple phrase: We arethe  true  circumcision,  who worship  in the Spirit of God  and glory in Christ Jesusand put no confidence in  the flesh. If our worship is in the Spirit, and if, bythat Spirit, we glory  in Christ; and if we put no confidence in the flesh -- what mancan do apart from the  Spirit -- it will happen. We must have him. We must. Seek him withme. Plead for his  fullness and power.     5 .


  Good news to the poor.   We  will develop new strategies for proclaiming the all-satisfyingsupremacy of God&#146;s  love and justice to the poor through          personal involvement;            a more welcoming atmosphere;            local missionary strategies of urbandisciple making; and            equipping missionaries for unreachedurban peoples.            How will such personal involvement come about?How shall we structure  ourselves for a welcoming atmosphere (not just on Sunday morning,but in our homes)? The  answer was on the lips of Jesus as soon as he entered his publicministry (Luke 4:18):           The Spirit of the lord is upon me,because he anointed me to preach    the gospel to the poor.        When the Spirit of the Lord comes, the heart ofthe Lord comes. And he  has a great heart for the poor, and a great calling for the rich.The question is: will  the Spirit of the Lord be upon us? God is calling us to be achurch bent on doing what we  cannot do without the Spirit of God. We must have him. We must.Seek him with me. Plead  for his fullness and power.     6. 

  Challenging Church and culture  with the truth.   We will challenge our culture and thewider Christian movement in  fresh ways with the Biblical truth of God&#146;s all-satisfyingsupremacy, by courageous  Christian action and speech in the secular world.    Where does this kind of courage come from? Wesee the answer in Acts  4:31,           And when they had prayed, the place wherethey had gathered    together was shaken, and they were all filled with the HolySpirit, and began to speak the    word of God with boldness .       That is, with courage! The courage we need tospeak to our decaying  culture and to our perishing colleagues comes from the fullness ofthe Holy Spirit.     Conclusion     Here&#146;s the sum of the matter. god hasgiven us a great mission  and great Fresh Initiatives. To help us he has put in motion arugged, robust Spiritual  Dynamic: Jesus Christ has  released  the merciful power ofGod by his sin-bearing  death; and the Holy Spirit is applying it to our church.Let&#146;s ask and seek and knock  unrelentingly until he comes in great power.
