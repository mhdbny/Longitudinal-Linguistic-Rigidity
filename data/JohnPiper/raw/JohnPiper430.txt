    January 15, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE       What to Eat While Fasting   (Matthew 3:16-4:4)            And after being baptized, Jesus went upimmediately from the water;    and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit ofGod descending as a dove,    and coming upon Him, and behold, a voice out of the heavens,saying, This is My    beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased. Then Jesus was ledup by the Spirit into the    wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And after He had fastedforty days and forty    nights, He then became hungry. And the tempter came and said toHim, If You are the    Son of God, command that these stones become bread. But Heanswered and said,    It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but onevery word that proceeds    out of the mouth of God.'             So far this year we have seen the prophets andteachers of Antioch  fasting in Acts 13 and we have heard Jesus teach us that when thebridegroom, namely,  himself, is taken out of the world then the attendants of thebridegroom, namely, we, his  disciples, will fast. And today we get to see Jesus the Son of Godhimself fasting.    I have two hopes for this message. One is thatwe know Jesus better.  Last week we heard him make the amazing claim that the bridegroomhad come -- God had  called himself the bridegroom and husband of Israel in the OldTestament. Now here was  Jesus saying -- the bridegroom is here. Today in this text we seeJesus as the  representative and head of a new Israel, as a kind of new Joshuapreparing to take his  people over into the promised land, but first tested in thewilderness.    My other hope, besides getting to know Jesusbetter, is that we  understand fasting better and see more deeply into its spiritualvalue for us individually  and as a church. It should give us pause I think to realize thatthe Son of God began his  life's ministry with a forty day fast. We should stop and thinkabout this. We should ask,  What about me Lord. Can I face the incredible challenges to myChristian life without  sharing in the fasting of Jesus?    Can we as a church experience the fullness ofChrist's power and  blessing without humbly seeking the Lord in fasting? These arepivotal days at Bethlehem.  I feel a stirring in my heart for what God is preparing for us.When the staff fasted last  Wednesday and prayed the Lord wove some words together that arefilled with hope. The last  paragraph of my 1994 annual report goes like this:         And finally, thanks to you all for yourprayer and your unfailing    encouragements. I am happy in this work because you have prayed.What a privilege to be    here! There are fresh breezes blowing. My sails are up. The skyis clearing. The Lord is    aboard and tells me there is good man-fishing not far out tosea.       My heart is so hungry for a deeper work of Godin our midst! A work  that will see supernatural new birth taking place week in and weekout through your  anointed lives in these Cities. This is why fasting is on thefront burner. Charles  Spurgeon, the London pastor from a century ago, said,          Our seasons of fasting and prayer at theTabernacle have been high days    indeed; never has Heaven's gate stood wider; never have ourhearts been nearer the central    Glory.        My heart longs for us as a church to be nearerthe Central Glory, to be  so near the fire that we burn with the zeal of Jesus for his nameand for this perishing  world.    So let's look now at his fasting.      Jesus' Forty Day Fast      Matthew 3:16 says that after being baptizedJesus came up out of  the water and the heavens opened and the Holy Spirit descended onhim like a dove. Now the  Holy Spirit had always been with Jesus. He was conceived by theHoly Spirit. But this was  a special anointing, or outpouring, or baptism that would rest onJesus for his three-year  public ministry. He was baptized to identify with us in hissubmission to God's rule and  righteousness. And the Holy Spirit came on him, as he does on us,to empower him and guide  him in the huge demands of his ministry.    As the Spirit comes upon Jesus God the Fathersays (v. 17), This  is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. One of thewonderful effects of these  words is to assure Jesus and us that the fire of misery and painthat Jesus was about to  walk into was NOT owing to his Father's displeasure.     This is especially important to see when younotice in the next verse  (Matthew 4:1) what the Spirit's first act is in Jesus' ministry.It says, Then Jesus  was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by thedevil. The first  act of the Spirit in Jesus' ministry is to lead him into thewilderness, and to expose him  to Satan's testings.    Under the Spirit's leading Jesus preparedhimself to meet the devil by  fasting. The Spirit of God willed that the Son of God be tested onhis way into the  ministry, and he willed that Jesus triumph in this testing throughfasting. Jesus  triumphed over the great enemy of his soul through fasting.     It seems to me that this story should shake us.Here is Jesus standing  on the threshold of the most important public ministry in thehistory of the world. On his  obedience and righteousness hangs the salvation of the world. Nonewill escape damnation  without this ministry of obedient suffering and death andresurrection. And God wills  that, at the very outset, the ministry be threatened withdestruction -- namely, the  temptations of Satan to abandon the path of lowliness andsuffering and obedience. And of  all the hundreds of things Jesus might have done to fight off thistremendous threat to  salvation, he is led to fast. To fast!    If Satan had succeeded in deterring Jesus fromthe path of humble,  suffering obedience there would be no salvation. We would still bein our sins and without  hope. Therefore we owe our salvation to the faithful fasting ofJesus. This is a  remarkable tribute to fasting. Don't ride over this quickly. Thinkon it. Jesus began his  ministry with fasting. And he triumphed over his enemy throughfasting.      Deuteronomy 8:2-3 Parallels Matthew4:1-4      Now to see the fuller meaning of this turnwith me to Deuteronomy  8. Every time Jesus responds to the three temptations of the devilin the wilderness he  quotes from Deuteronomy. Man shall not live by breadalone -- Deuteronomy 8:3;  You shall not tempt the Lord your God -- Deuteronomy6:16; and You shall  worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve --Deuteronomy 6:13.    This is very significant. Here is Jesus led bythe Spirit into the  wilderness -- the wilderness -- and to counter the temptations ofSatan Jesus quotes  passages from Deuteronomy, all of which are spoken by Moses to thepeople of Israel about  their time of testing in the wilderness. In Matthew 4:3-4 it says,         The tempter came and said to Him, 'If You arethe Son of God, command    that these stones become bread.' 4 But He answered and said, 'Itis written, Man shall not    live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of themouth of God.'       Now look at Deuteronomy 8:2-3 and mark theparallels that you see  between that situation in the wilderness and Jesus' situation inthe wilderness. Moses  says to the people,          You shall remember all the way which theLord your God has led you    in the wilderness  [NOTE: as Jesus was led by the Spirit inthe wilderness]  these    forty years  [NOTE: as Jesus was there forty days],  thatHe might humble you,    testing you  [NOTE: as Jesus was tested] , toknow what was in your    heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. 3 And Hehumbled you and let you be    hungry  [NOTE: as Jesus was made hungry by his fasting], and fed you with manna    which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He mightmake you understand that    man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everythingthat proceeds out of the    mouth of the Lord.        There are too many similarities between what ishappening to Jesus here  in the wilderness and what was happening to the people of Israelto think it is an  accident. What does this mean?    It means that God is now preparing to deliverhis people -- the new  Israel -- from the Egyptian bondage of sin into the promised landof forgiveness and  righteousness and peace and joy and eternal life. To do this hehas sent a new Joshua --  Joshua and Jesus are exactly the same word in Greek (Acts 7:45).This new Joshua stands as  the head and representative of the whole people. On their behalfhe will now be led by God  into the wilderness. It will be 40 days to represent forty years.He will be tested as  Israel was tested. And he will hunger as Israel hungered. And ifhe triumphs he and all  his people go safely into the promised land.      The Aim of Jesus' Fast (AndOurs)      Now we can see the meaning of Jesus'fasting more clearly. It  wasn't an arbitrary choice of something to do in the face ofSatanic temptation. It was a  voluntary act of identification with the people of God in theirwilderness deprivation and  trial. Jesus was saying in effect, I have been sent to leadthe people of God out of  the Egypt of sin into the promised land of salvation. To do this Imust be one of them.  That is why I was born. Therefore I will take on the testing thatthey experienced. I will  represent them in the wilderness and allow my heart to be probedwith fasting to show  where my allegiance is. And with the Spirit's help I will triumphthrough this fasting,  overcome the devil and lead all who trust me into the promisedland of eternal  glory.    In other words Jesus' fasting is part of histesting the way hunger was  for the people of Israel in the wilderness. But that doesn't meanfasting wasn't a means  of battling Satan. Because fasting reveals where the heart is. Andwhen the heart proves  to love God more than bread, Satan does not have the foothold hewould if our heart was in  love with the earthly things like bread.    The people of God are often called to gowithout the ordinary means of  life. Fasting is a brief, voluntary experience of this deprivationto prove our hearts.  When we experience this going without, the Lordreveals what is in our hearts.  What are we controlled by? Richard Foster says in his chapter onfasting,         More than any other single Discipline,fasting reveals the things that    control us. this is a wonderful benefit to the true disciple wholongs to be transformed    into the image of Jesus Christ. We cover up what is inside uswith food and other good    things, but in fasting these things surface. If pride controlsus, it will be revealed    almost immediately. David said, I humbled my soul withfasting (Ps. 69:10).    Anger, bitterness, jealousy, strife, fear -- if they are withinus, they will surface    during fasting. At first we will rationalize that our anger isdue to our hunger then we    know that we are angry because the spirit of anger is within us.We can rejoice in this    knowledge because we know that healing is available through thepower or Christ.       What are we slaves to? What are our bottom linepassions? Fasting is  God's testing ground -- and healing ground. Will we murmur as theIsraelites murmured when  they had no bread? Will we leave the path of obedience and turnstones into bread? Or will  we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth ofGod? Fasting is a way  of revealing to ourselves and confessing to God what is in ourhearts.     And the aim of fasting is that we come to relyless on food and more on  God himself. That's the meaning of the words in Matthew 4:4,Man shall not live on  bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth ofGod. Every time we  fast we are saying with Jesus, Not bread alone. But you,Lord. Not bread alone, but  you, Lord.    Let me show you quickly in closing why I thinkJesus is saying that we  should trust in God not bread.    It comes from the context of Deuteronomy 8:3where Jesus gets this word  in Matthew 4:4,          [God] fed you with manna which you didnot know, nor did your    fathers know,  that  [NOTE!] He might make you understandthat man does not live by    bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out ofthe mouth of the Lord.        He gave them manna -- an utterly un-heard-offood falling from heaven  -- Why? So that they would learn to live on everythingthat comes from the  mouth of God. How does miraculous manna teach that? Because mannais one of the incredible  ways God can, with a mere word, reveal himself and meet your needswhen all else looks  hopeless.    But watch what Satan does with that. Satan saysto Jesus, If you  are the Son of God, turn this stone to bread. In otherwords, Do the manna  thing. Make manna like you did in the wilderness. If the point ofmanna in the wilderness  was to teach the people to expect miracles in distress, then treatyourself to some  miracle bread, and you will be obeying scripture.    And Jesus responds, You are so close andyet so far. You have  always handled the word of God that way, so subtle. You sound likeyou approve God's word,  but you turn every word against him. The point is this Satan:Don't trust in bread -- not  even miracle bread -- trust in God. Don't get your deepestsatisfactions in life from food  -- not even God-wrought miracle food -- but from God. Every wordthat comes out of the  mouth of God reveals God. And it is this self-revelation that wefeed on. This will last  for ever. This is eternal life. Begone, Satan, God is my portion.I will not turn from his  path and his fellowship, not even for miraculous manna.    I invite you let God prove your heart withfasting this Wednesday. See  if he does not reveal some deep things too you, and give himselfto you for food.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
