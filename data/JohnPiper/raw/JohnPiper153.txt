  July 13, 1986Bethlehem Baptist ChurchJohn Piper, PastorCopyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   THE FRUIT OF HOPE: LOVE  (Colossians 1:3-8) We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray foryou, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the lovewhich you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you inheaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospelwhich has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit andgrowing - so among yourselves, from the day you heard and understood thegrace of God in truth, as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellowservant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf and has made knownto us your love in the Spirit. The question we are asking in the month of July is: What is the fruit ofChristian hope? Last week we answered that the fruit of hope is joy, because in Romans 12:12Paul commands Christians to "rejoice in hope." In other words, God nevercommands a Christian to be happy if there is nothing to look forward to.But the gospel is the good news that there is always something to look forwardto -- something so good that any suffering that may be required of us willseem light and momentary by comparison (2 Corinthians 4:17). And since thereis always a secure and happy future laid up for the Christian, the commandremains in force: Rejoice always, and again I say, Rejoice! Now someone may object and say, "That theology is so future-oriented andso other-worldly that it takes people's minds off the pressing needs of thepresent and turns them in on themselves and their own private spiritualhappiness." In other words, it does not produce love; it produces escapism. And so we must ask, Is it true that when Christians set their hearts earnestlyand intensely on the future prospect of sharing the glory of God, and seeingthe risen Lord, and being freed from sin and sickness, and living in joyfor all eternity -- when Christians set their hearts with deep longing andstrong confidence on these things, do they become so heavenly-minded thatthey are of no earthly use? Do they become self-centered and fall prey toescapism? Today's message is intended to show that the Bible portrays just the opposite.It teaches and shows that a strong confidence in the promises of God anda passionate preference for the joy of heaven over the joy of the world freesa person from worldly self-centeredness, from paralyzing regret and self-pity,from fear and greed and bitterness and despair and laziness and impatienceand envy. And in the place of all these sins hope bears the fruit of love. The problem with the church today is not that there are too many people whoare passionately in love with heaven. Name three! The problem is not thatprofessing Christians are retreating from the world, spending half theirdays reading Scripture and the other half singing about their pleasures inGod all the while indifferent to the needs of the world. The problem is thatprofessing Christians are spending ten minutes reading Scripture and thenhalf their day making money and the other half enjoying and repairing whatthey spend it on. It is not heavenlimindedness that hinders love. It is worldlimindness thathinders love, even when it is disguised by a religious routine on the weekend.Where is the person whose heart is so passionately in love with the promisedglory of heaven that he feels like an exile and a sojourner on the earth?Where is the person who has so tasted the beauty of the age to come thatthe diamonds of the world look like baubles, and the entertainment of theworld is empty, and the moral causes of the world are too small because theyhave no view to eternity? Where is this person? He is not in bondage to TV-watching or eating or sleeping or drinking orpartying or fishing or sailing or putzing around. He is a free man in a foreignland. And his one question is this: How can I maximize my enjoyment of Godfor all eternity while I am an exile on this earth? And his answer is alwaysthe same: by doing the labors of love. Only one thing satisfies the heart whose treasure is in heaven: doing theworks of heaven. And heaven is a world of love! It is not the cords of heaventhat bind the hands of love. It is the love of money and leisure and comfortand praise -- these are the cords that bind the hands of love. And the powerto sever these cords is Christian hope. I say it again with all the conviction that lies within me: it is notheavenlimindedness that hinders love on this earth. It is worldlimindedness.And therefore the great fountain of love is the powerful, freeing confidenceof Christian hope! Let's go to the Scriptures and see if these things are so! Our text is Colossians 1, especially verses 3-8. What I would like to dois make four brief observations about love from this text, then tie themall together in a way that will give guidance for our lives, and then illustratethe main point from some Biblical examples of people whose love was the fruitof hope. 1. The first observation about love is that love is a public fruit. It cannotbe kept secret. Verse 4: We have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you havefor all the saints. The Colossians have a reputation for their faith and love. Therefore I inferthat their faith and love have become public. They have fulfilled the wordsof the Lord, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your goodworks and give glory to your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Love is notmerely a private and secret affair. It always involves other people and soit becomes public. It is a public fruit. 2. The second observation about love is that it is the fruit of hope. Itis the overflow of the fountain of hope. Verses 4-5a: v4) We have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which youhave for all the saints, v5) because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. The connection between verses 4 and 5 shows that hope is the cause of love.They have love for all the saints BECAUSE of the hope laid up for them inheaven. The word "hope" here in verse 5 refers to the content of our hope-- to the thing hoped for, to the actual joys laid up for us in heaven. Itdoesn't refer to the feeling of hope in our hearts. But if you ask how a distant future benefit causes love in the present theanswer is that the hope laid up for us in heaven inspires hope and confidenceand freedom in the present. The link between the objective hope laid up inheaven and the active love for the saints on the earth is the subjectiveexperience of hope welling up in our hearts. So the second observation about love is that it is caused by hope, it isa fruit of hope. 3. The third observation is that love is a fruit of the gospel. Picking upin the middle of verse 5 it says, Of this (i.e. the hope laid up in heaven) you have heard before in the wordof truth, the gospel 6) which has come to you, as indeed in the whole worldit is bearing fruit and growing -- so among yourselves, from the day youheard and and understood the grace of God in truth. The gospel is bearing fruit and growing wherever it is preached, just asalso among the Colossians. So when Paul hears that there is faith and loveflourishing among the Colossians he sees it not only as evidence of the powerof hope, but also as evidence of the power of the gospel. Love is a fruitof hope. And love is a fruit of the gospel. And this is simple to understand because verse 6 says that the hope was heardin the word of truth, the gospel. We should keep this in mind whenever weshare the gospel -- it is a message of promises from God offered to peoplewho will stop hoping in the promises of the world and start hoping in thepromises of God. So we have seen that love is a public fruit; love is a fruit of hope; andlove is a fruit of the gospel. 4. Now the fourth observation is that love is a fruit of the Spirit. Verse7 continues on by saying that the Colossians had heard the Gospel from Epaphrasour beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf8) and has made known to us your love in the Spirit. So the love that the Colossians have for Paul and for all the saints is nota love that is natural to the human heart. It happens "in the Spirit." Itis, as Galatians 5:22 says, a "fruit of the Spirit." This is why Paul thanksGod in verse 3 that he has heard of their faith and love -- "We always thankGod, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because wehave heard of your faith . . . and love." If it had been the invention andproduct of the Colossians Paul would have thanked the Colossians. But sincefaith and love are God's work, Paul thanks God. Now lets tie these four observations together in a way that will give guidancefor our lives. If our goal is to bear the public fruit of love, if we wantto live in a way that will visibly honor God, this text directs us to dothree things. 1. It directs us to give heed to the gospel. Practically this means listento the word of God. Read the word of God, especially the promises and warnings.Verse 5 says that we learn about hope in the word of truth, the gospel. Dayin and day out we must direct the attention of our minds to the word of truth. 2. The text directs us to be in the Spirit. Verse 8 says that the love ofthe Colossians is a love "in the Spirit." It is the Spirit that makes thedifference between whether the gospel will create hope in you or whetherit leaves you cold. Paul described the way the gospel came to the Thessalonians like this: "Ourgospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spiritand with full conviction" (1:5-6). The result was that they had so much hopethat they rejoiced even in much affliction (v. 6), and became imitators ofthe Lord. So practically we must endeavor to forsake all self-reliance as we hear theword of God, and seek the power of the Holy Spirit -- not to tell us thingsthat aren't in the Scriptures, but to make us feel the wonder of what isin the Scriptures. "Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out ofthy law" (Psalm 119:18). We should pray for ourselves the way Paul prayedfor the Ephesians: "that God may enlighten the eyes of our hearts to knowwhat is the hope to which he has called us, and what are the riches of hisglorious inheritance in the saints . . ." (1:18). 3. The third thing the text directs us to do, if we want to produce the fruitof love, is to set our hearts on the hope laid up for us in heaven. Colossians3:1-2 says, "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things thatare above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mindson things that are above, not on things that are on the earth." In other words, as you read or hear the word of God, and as you rely on thesupernatural work of the Holy Spirit, you should consciously will to transferyour affections off the world and onto the hope laid up for you in heaven.I believe this is what it means when Philippians 2:12 says, "Work our yourown salvation . . . for God is at work in you both to will and to work forhis good pleasure." In summary, direct the attention of your mind day and night to the word ofGod's promises, seek in all humility the help of the Holy Spirit to see thewonder of what is really there, and, as Peter says, "Set your hope fullyon the grace that is coming to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ" (1Peter 1:13). And by the grace of God the result will be the visible fruit of love.         We will be more patient, more kind.       We will be less jealous, and boastful and arrogant and rude.       We will not just seek our own advancement but will strive to do to others    what we would have them do to us.       We will not be so irritable.       We won't be so prone to keep an account of wrongs or return evil for evil.       We will be inclined to bear all things and endure all things for the sake    of our neighbor.       We will not speak about our neighbor's faults without first going to the    neighbor ourselves.       We will return good for evil, and use our discretionary time not by maximizing    our fleeting comforts but by devising ways to be a blessing to the lost and    suffering.       More and more our whole lives will take on an overflowing and other-directed    spirit.   And this love will transform you and your family and the church, and, asJesus says, the world will see your good deeds and give glory to your Fatherin heaven (Matthew 5:16). There is no better evangelism in all the worldthan a church whose hope in God is so strong that they gladly deny themselvesin order to meet the needs of others. Now we have made our four observations about love from the text: it is apublic fruit; it is a fruit of hope; it is a fruit of the gospel; and itis a fruit of the Spirit. And we have tied these together in a way that givessome practical guidance for our lives: give heed to the promises of God'sword; prayerfully rely on the Holy Spirit; set your affections on the hopelaid up for you in heaven; and in the power of that hope, walk in love. Now let me close with two Biblical illustrations of people who have performedacts of love by the power of hope. I pray that these illustrations will stiryou to hope and love the way they did.  1. Hebrews 10:34 The situation is that some of the church members had been imprisoned andthe rest were faced with the moral dilemma of whether to go underground andsave themselves, or whether to go visit the prisoners and risk losing lifeand possessions. Verse 34 describes what they did and why. For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plunderingof your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possessionand an abiding one. What was the power that drove them in love to the prison doors knowing theirhouses would be plundered? "Because you knew that you yourselves had a betterpossession and an abiding one." It was hope that drove them to love. Or toput it another way, it was heavenlimindedness that broke the power of worldlylove for furniture and houses and security and freed the saints to risk theirlives in love. Therefore, I say it again, it is not heavenlimindedness thathinders love. When religious people fail to love, it is not because theyhave fallen in love with heaven, but because they are still in love withthe world.  2. Hebrews 11:24-26 What power moved Moses to leave the comforts of Pharaoh's court and becomethe leader of a grumbling and stiff-necked people, and to be faithful tothem for forty years of trouble? By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh'sdaughter, choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God thanto enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered abuse suffered forthe Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked to thereward. Here is an illustration of how a confident hope for a great reward actuallychanges our values. Moses actually considered abuse and reproach for thecause of the Messiah to be greater wealth than all the treasures of Egypt.He was utterly out of step with the world around him. He had been transformedby the renewing of his mind. How? It says at the end of verse 26, "becausehe looked to the reward." He had set his mind on the great promises of God. And so let it be said again, it is not heavenlimindedness that binds thehands of love. On the contrary it is the worldly desire for Egypt's pleasuresand the worldly fear of suffering that shackles the hands of love. But whena person looks away from the world to the exceedingly great reward of God'spromises, and lives with a deep confidence in the coming glory of the childrenof God, the shackles of worldliness are broken and the hands of love arefreed.         O that God would come down even today       in the power of his Holy Spirit,       for the honor of his only Son,       and fill us with the hope of glory,       and break the bonds of worldliness       that bind the hands of love!       Amen.     (For other illustrations of hope giving rise to love see Hebrews 12:1-2;13:5-6; Luke 14:12-14; Matthew 6:7-12, note the relationship between vv.7-11 and 12.)
