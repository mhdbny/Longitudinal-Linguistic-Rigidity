      October 29, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church   Volume 6    . . . Sustained by all His Grace   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document   The Spiritual Dynamic (Part 4)        This morning we complete our interpretationof page two of the  mission/vision statement of our church -- The SpiritualDynamic that drives our  Mission. The phrase we focus on is . . . sustained byall His Grace.      Grace Sustains Everything     Consider this word sustained.In the Twin Cities  Marathon a few weeks ago one of the wheel chair participants had ablow out near the end  of the race. But he kept going on the rim of his wheel, until fiveblocks from the finish  line the wheel buckled and the chair fell over. Some people fromthe sidelines ran to him  and held the chair level, running along beside him while hefinished the race. They  sustained him. They held him up. They enabled him to do what heneeded to do. That&#146;s  what grace does for us.    But the comparison is not exact. In fact it isvery misleading. Because  while the friends holding up the chair is a good picture of grace,it was the man&#146;s  tremendous upper-body strength that got him across the finish lineafter 26 miles, and his  friends had nothing to do with that. That strength came from himnot them. But grace is  not like that. Grace sustains everything in the Christian life. Itholds up the broken  chair. It gives the upper-body strength. It prevents otherobstacles. It keeps his heart  beating. It keeps his eyes seeing. Grace sustains everything inthe Christian life.    Let me show you a few verses to give someBiblical basis to this claim.  In 1 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says,           And what do you have that you did notreceive? But if you did    receive it, why do you boast as if you had not receivedit ?         The answer to that first question isnothing.  What do you have that you have not received? Answer:nothing. But in spite of  this there was boasting going on in the church at Corinth. Whichto Paul&#146;s mind was  totally contradictory to reality. If all you have is a free giftfrom God -- that&#146;s  what grace means -- then you can&#146;t boast as if it were not agift. Grace eliminates  boasting. You can&#146;t boast as though you create and sustainwhat grace creates and  sustains.    That&#146;s why Paul said that he would notboast except in the cross  of Christ which is the ground of grace (Galatians 6:14) and in hisweaknesses which show  his need for grace (2 Corinthians 12:9). And it&#146;s why he saidin Romans 15:18,           I will not presume to speak of anythingexcept what Christ has    accomplished through me .       So for Paul everything good that he has is agift of grace, and  everything he accomplishes with what he has is a work of grace.And so all boasting is  excluded, except boasting in grace.    Here&#146;s another example of this all-supplying work of grace that  makes it different from holding up a wheelchair so that strongpeople can finish showing  their strength. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says,           By the grace of God I am what I am, andHis grace toward me did not    prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I,but the grace of God with    me .       Now if you only read the words, I laboredeven more than all of  them, you might think that grace is like a few friendsholding up your wheelchair so  you could show your upper-body strength and finish the race. Butthat won&#146;t work in  this text.    Two reasons:     1) It says,  By the grace of God  Iam what I am  .  In other words the Paul which labored so hard got to be that wayby the grace of God. So  even though he is working hard to preach the gospel, yet thehe that is  working hard is a work of grace.     2) The other reason grace is not like holdingup a wheelchair is at the  end of the verse. After Paul says,  I labored even morethan all of them,  he  says,  Y et not I , but the grace of God withme .  The  grace of God  with  me , might sound like grace washolding up the wheel  chair and Paul was independently doing his part to turn the wheelsand get across the  finish line. So riding well and getting to heaven would be a teamproject and grace would  get some credit and Paul would get some credit. But Paul guardsagainst that  interpretation with the words,  Yet not I . Theeffect of grace is so  all-pervading and so all-influencing and all-sufficient and all-necessary that when it has  done its work you say, I worked, yet not I.     That means that we really do work, but all ourworking is the fruit of  enabling grace. Paul explains this in Philippians 2:12b-13,           Work out your salvation with fear andtrembling;  13  for it is    God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His goodpleasure .       We work, but when we have worked  by faith inGod&#146;s enabling  future grace  (rather than for the merit of the law), we turnaround and say about our  work, My work was God&#146;s work in me, willing anddoing his good  pleasure.     So when we say here at the end of the SpiritualDynamic that we are  . . . sustained by all His Grace, we do not meansustained like friends  sustaining a broken wheelchair while we do our own independentwork. We mean that  everything in this spiritual dynamic is sustained by God&#146;sgrace. Treasuring  all that God is is a work of grace in my heart. I would nottreasure God without a  mighty work of grace in my life (Acts 18:27; Phil. 1:29; Eph.2:8f; 2 Tim. 2:25).  Loving all whom he loves is a work of grace in myheart (1 Thess. 3:12; 4:9;  Phil 1:9; Gal. 5:22). Praying for all his purposes isa work of grace in my  heart (Phi. 2:13; Heb. 13:21). And meditating on all hisword, is a work of  grace (Psa. 119:36).    Why has God set it up this way? Because thegiver gets the glory. God  has established the universe in such a way that it magnifies theglory of his  all-sufficiency. You can see this really clearly in 1 Peter 4:11.          Whoever serves, let him do so as by thestrength which God supplies  [that&#146;s    grace] ; so that in all things God may be glorified throughJesus Christ, to whom    belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.        God gets the glory because he gave the grace.    So you see, I hope, why the goal (or the top)of our Spiritual Dynamic  is  the supremacy of the glory of God , and the ground (orthe bottom) of our  Spiritual Dynamic is  the all-sustaining grace of God.  Allthings are by his grace  because all things are for his glory. The all-sufficient,inexhaustible Giver gets the  glory.     Grace: Pardon for Sins and Power forObedience     Now let&#146;s draw out two lessons aboutgrace from what we have  seen so far.    1) First, grace is both pardon for the sins ofthe past and power for  the obedience of the future. This is what we have seen. We believein the great news of  Ephesians 2:8, By grace you have been saved throughfaith. This is bygone  grace. It&#146;s past. It was demonstrated in the death of Christon the cross bearing our  sins and removing the curse of the law and absorbing the wrath ofGod. Without this grace  no good thing could come to us as sinners. No promises could bemade.    But just as important as this bygone grace ofpardon is the future  grace of power. Jesus said to Paul, when he wondered how he wouldbe able to endure his  thorn in the flesh,      My  grace  is sufficient for you,for  power  is  perfected in weakness .     Grace is power for Christian living. Grace isthe power to treasure all  that God is for us in Jesus. Grace is the power to love all whomGod loves. Grace is the  power to pray for all God&#146;s purposes. Grace is the power tomeditate on all  God&#146;s word. We are utterly dependent on grace for ourSpiritual Dynamic at Bethlehem.    So grace is not only a past experience ofpardon, it is a future  experience of power to do what God commands us to do. This is whygratitude for past grace  is not the fuel for today&#146;s obedience. You can&#146;t runyour car on gratitude for  yesterday&#146;s gas. You need today&#146;s gas for today&#146;strip. You need  today&#146;s grace for today&#146;s obedience. And the pump is notgratitude but faith in  future grace. The great challenge of this mission statement islearning how to live by  faith in future grace.     God is Most Glorified in Us When We Are MostSatisfied in Him     2) The second lesson about grace from whatwe have seen is that it  explains the connection between the supremacy of God joy in ourmission statement:  To spread a passion for the  supremacy of God  in allthings for the  joy   of all peoples.     Why does a passion for the supremacy of Godresult in joy? Answer:  because the inexhaustible supremacy of God&#146;s glory isexperienced in the overflow of  his grace. If you want to magnify the supremacy of God the way theBible magnifies the  supremacy of God, you have to call attention to the lavishoverflow of God&#146;s grace.  Remember, the Giver gets the glory. So knowing about grace andexperiencing grace as the  power for all Christian believing and living is the best way tomagnify the supremacy of  God. When you depend on God for everything instead of thinking ofhim depending on you,  you call attention to the supremacy of his fullness and his all-sufficiency.    We like to say,  God is most glorified in uswhen we are most  satisfied in him.  So the connection between God&#146;ssupremacy and our joy is that  his supremacy is manifest most by his all-supplying, all-satisfying grace.     God&#146;s Grace and Bethlehem&#146;s FreshInitiatives     Now let&#146;s conclude by applying this toa few of our fresh  initiatives on page three. What we are saying is that the missionof the church is only  possible by the powerful work of God&#146;s grace in our lives.Thus if anything good  comes of this whole enterprise it will be owing to God&#146;sgrace. I hope in the years  to come as we look back we can say, By the grace of God weare what we are and his  grace to us was not in vain, but we worked hard. But it was not webut the grace of God  that was with us.    Take the first fresh initiative, for example.            The value of relationships.  We will take new practical      steps to develop an atmosphere where personal, deepening,supportive, faith-building      relationships of love are highly valued as expressions of ourpassion for the supremacy of      God&#146;s love.            The best exposition of this is in the side barat the bottom:          Therefore, we embrace God&#146;s call fornew, visible manifestations    of love toward each other, our guests and our neighbors. With afresh openness and    outgoing spirit to each other and to all new people, wehenceforth put understanding above    accusation, forbearance above fault-finding, and Biblical unityabove the demand for    uniformity.        And I would add that the most pressing areawhere that needs to be  applied is in the area of worship forms during this interim periodat Bethlehem (fresh  initiative number 4).    But now where do we get the help to be thatkind of person if we by  nature are accusing, blaming and fault-finding? Hebrews 4:16 givesthe most crucial  answer:           Let us therefore draw near with confidenceto the throne  of grace ,    that we may receive mercy and may find  grace  to help intime of need.        This is a time of need in our church. And anexciting time of need for  love, for patience, for understanding, for forbearance. Whichmeans it is a time to go to  God for grace. We need to be sustained by grace. And when we arefull grace, grace will  come out of our mouths.    Consider Ephesians 4:29.           Let no unwholesome word proceed from yourmouth, but only such a    word as is good for edification according to the need of themoment, that it may give  grace     to those who hear .        Do your words about worship in this transitiontime at Bethlehem build  people up and give grace to those who hear? Are they a spilloverof the grace you are  enjoying from the throne of grace as you go there hour by hour andfill up?    Or consider Fresh Initiative number 3.            Interracial reconciliation.  Against the rising spirit      of indifference, alienation and hostility in our land, we willembrace the supremacy of      God&#146;s love to take new steps personally and corporatelytoward racial reconciliation,      expressed visibly in our community and in our church.            The more I think about this and the more Ilisten to others who are  working on it, the more it is plain to me that this is somethingthat demands a long-term,  persistent, rugged, in-your-face kind of love. This, perhaps, morethan any initiative  will feel depleting. So where are you going to get that kind ofcommitment -- that kind of  love?    2 Corinthians 9:8 gives the essential answer:          God is able to make  all grace abound to you, that always    having all sufficiency in everything, you may abound for everygood deed .       That is an amazing promise. Every good deed inracial reconciliation  God has for you to do, he is able to give you the grace to do. Youdon&#146;t have wear  out. You don&#146;t have to give up. You don&#146;t have to bedepleted. There is  all  sufficiency  in  everything  for  every  good work. Future grace isthe gas for tomorrows  obedience.    Will we believe in it and live by faith init?    There are promises of future grace for everyoneof our Fresh  Initiatives. What this little booklet of our mission statement iscalling for us to do is  to learn how to live by faith in future grace. And the reason thatmatters so much is that  when the all-sufficiency of grace is magnified God is magnified.    Some of us here this morning need to repent ofoffending against the  Spirit of grace -- perhaps most of us. Hebrews 10:29 speaks ofinsulting the Spirit of  grace. And Ephesians 4:30 speaks of grieving the Holy Spirit byour unedifying words. So  let&#146;s repent and turn from old patterns of negativism andfault-finding, and learn  together to walk and talk by faith in future grace.           God is able to make  all grace abound to you, that always    having all sufficiency in everything, you may abound for everygood deed.        Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
