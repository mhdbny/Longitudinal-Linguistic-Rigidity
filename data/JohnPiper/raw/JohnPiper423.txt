  November 20, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       ARE YOU HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BE CARE-FREE?    (1 Peter 5:5-7)        You younger men, likewise, be subject toyour elders;      and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one      another, for God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to      the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand      of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all      your anxiety upon Him, because he cares foryou.         Introduction       Humility is not a popular human trait in the modern world. It's   not touted in the talk shows or celebrated in valedictorian   speeches or commended in diversity seminars or listed with core   values. And if you go to the massive self-help section of B.   Dalton's or Barnes and Noble you won't find books on humility.       The basic reason for this is not hard to find: humility can   only survive in the presence of God. When God goes humility goes.   In fact you might say that humility follows God like a shadow. We   can expect to find humility applauded in our society as often as   we find God applauded -- which means almost never.       In September (12th) the Star Tribune carried a guest editorial   that captured the atmosphere that asphyxiates humility:       There are some who naively cling to the nostalgic memory of   God. The average churchgoer takes a few hours out of the week to   experience the sacred . . . But the rest of the time, he is   immersed in a society that no longer acknowledges God as an   omniscient and omnipotent force to be loved and worshiped. . .   Today we are too sophisticated for God. We can stand on our own;   we are prepared and ready to choose and define our own existence.       In this atmosphere humility cannot survive. It disappears with   God. When God is neglected the runner up god takes his place,   namely, man. And that by definition is the opposite of humility,   namely, pride.       So the atmosphere we breathe is hostile to humility. And this   text is utterly foreign to our times and utterly necessary. If   what is said here doesn't take root in our lives, we will not be a   Christian church; ad we will not be salt and light for a perishing   world.       The main point of this passage is that we Christians should be   humble people. Three times the command comes in one form or   another. 1) Verse 5a: "Younger men, be subject (i.e., be humble   toward) to your elders." 2) Verse 5b: "All of you, clothe   yourselves with humility toward one another." 3) Verse 6: "Humble   yourselves under the mighty hand of God."       So the main point is plain in these three verses: humility is   essential in the life of a Christian. It is a defining mark of a   true Christian.       So Peter also gives reasons or incentives -- at least four.       1) Verse 5b: "God is opposed to the proud." Nothing could be   worse than to have an infinitely powerful and holy God opposed to   you. So don't be proud.       2) Verse 5b: "God gives grace to the humble." And nothing could   be better than to have an infinitely powerful and wise God treat   us graciously. He does that to the humble. The reason is not that   humility is a performance of virtue that earns grace but that   humility is a confession of emptiness that receives grace. Blessed   are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.       3) Verse 6: God will use his mighty hand to exalt the humble:   "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that   He may exalt you at the proper time."       4) Verse 7: God will use his mighty hand to care for the   humble: "Casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares for   you."       Be a humble person because, if you are proud, God will be   against you in your pride, but if you are humble he will give you   grace, exalt you in due time, and care for you along the way so   that you don't have to be anxious.       That's the basic message of the text. Now how shall it take   root in our minds and hearts and make a powerful difference in the   way we live to God's honor? Let me try to make it sink deeper into   us by asking two questions:       1. What is pride and humility?       2. What is the connection between humility and not being   anxious?       The Connection Between Humility and Not Being Anxious       I'll start with the second one. Did you notice (in the NASB)   the grammatical connection between verses 6 and 7? "Humble   yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may   exalt you at the proper time, 7 casting all your anxiety upon Him,   because He cares for you." It's not merely a new sentence. It's a   subordinate clause. "Humble yourselves . . . casting your   anxieties on him." I think this means that casting your anxieties   on God is an expression of humility. It's like saying, "Eat   politely . . . chewing with your mouth shut." "Drive carefully . .   . keeping your eyes open." "Be generous . . . inviting someone   over on Thanksgiving."       "Humble yourselves . . . casting your anxieties on God." One   way to be humble is to cast your anxieties on God. Which means   that one hindrance to casting your anxieties on God is pride.   Which means that undue worry about your future is probably a form   of pride.       Now there is more to say about that. But to feel the full force   of it we need to answer the first question, and then come back to   this connection between pride and anxiety.       What is Pride and Humility?       The second question was What is pride and humility?       I'll try to answer that with ten Biblical observations about   pride. Humility is the opposite.       1. Pride is self-satisfaction.       God says to Israel in Hosea 13:4-6,       I have been the Lord your God since the land of Egypt . . . 5 I   cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of drought. 6 As they   had their pasture, they became satisfied, and being satisfied,   their heart became proud; therefore, they forgot Me. (Cf. Jer.   49:4)       2. Pride is self-sufficiency and self-reliance.        Moses warns the people of God inDeuteronomy 8:11-17      about what will happen when they have rest in the promised      land:       
       Beware . . . 12 lest, when you have eaten and are satisfied,      and have built good houses and lived in them, 13 and when your      herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and gold      multiply . . . 14 then your heart becomes proud, and you forget      the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt .      . . &#91;and you&#93; 17 say in your heart, 'My power and the      strength of my hand made me thiswealth.'         God's goodness is turned into self-sufficiency.       3. Pride considers itself above instruction.       In Jeremiah 13:9-10 God says to the people of Judah,        I will destroy the pride of Judah and thegreat pride      of Jerusalem. 10 This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My      words, who walk in the stubbornness of theirhearts.         Pride stubbornly refuses to be taught the way of God, and makes   its own wishes the measure of truth.       4. Pride is insubordinate.       Psalm 119:21 says,       Thou dost rebuke the arrogant, the cursed who wander from Thy   commandments.       When the commandments of God are spoken, pride turns away and   will not submit. It rejects the right and authority of God to   command.       5. Pride takes credit for what God alone does.       One of the most vivid illustrations of this is the case of   Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.        &#91;Nebuchadnezzar said&#93;, "Is thisnot Babylon      the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by      the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?" 31      While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice came from      heaven, saying, "King Nebuchadnezzar . . . sovereignty has been      removed from you . . . 32 until you recognize that the Most      High is ruler over the realm of mankind, and bestows it on      whomever He wishes (Daniel 4:30-32).         Then, after his season of humiliation grazing in the fields   like and ox, Nebuchadnezzar is restored and confesses,        Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise, exalt, andhonor the King      of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He      is able to humble those who walk in pride (Daniel 4:7; cf.      Isaiah 10:12).         6. Pride exults in being made much of.       Jesus indicted the religious leaders in Jerusalem:        And they love the place of honor atbanquets, and the      chief seats in the synagogues, 7 and respectful greetings in      the market places, and being called by men, Rabbi. (Matthew      23:6)         7. Pride aspires to the place of God.       In our family devotions we just read the story of Herod's pride   in Acts 12        And on an appointed day Herod, having puton his royal      apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an      address to them. 22 And the people kept crying out, "The voice      of a god and not of a man!" 23 And immediately an angel of the      Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he      was eaten by worms and died. (Acts 12;21-23; cf. Is. 14:12-14)         8. Pride opposes the very existence of God.       Psalm 10:4        The wicked, in the haughtiness of hiscountenance,      does not seek &#91;God&#93;. All his thoughts are, "There is no      God."         Pride knows that the simplest solution for its own survival   would be that there be no God at all. That would be, as the Nazi's   might say, "The Final Solution" for the survival of pride.       It doesn't come as any surprise then that . . .       9. Pride refuses to trust in God.       Proverbs 28:25 contrasts arrogance and trust:        An arrogant man stirs up strife, but hewho trusts in      the Lord will prosper.         Pride cannot trust God. The posture of trust is too weak. Too   dependent. It calls too much attention to the strength and wisdom   of another. Trusting God is the heartbeat of humility, the   opposite of pride.       When pride keeps us from trusting in God to take care of us   there are two possibilities: one is that we feel a false security   based on our own imagined power and shrewdness to avert   catastrophe. The other is that we realize that we cannot guarantee   our security, and so we feel anxious.       Which brings us to the tenth trait of pride and the final   explanation about the connection between 1 Peter 5:6 and 7.       10. Pride is anxious about the future.       In Isaiah 51:12-13 God says to anxious Israel that their   problem is pride.        I, even I, am He who comforts you. Whoare you that      you are afraid of man who dies, and of the son of man who is      made like grass; 13 that you have forgotten the Lord your      Maker?         Who do you think you are to be afraid? Sounds strange doesn't   it. But that's how subtle pride is. Pride is the root of our   anxiety.        Now we can see clearly and feel the forceof 1 Peter      5:6-7,             Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,      that He may exalt you at the proper time . ..         How? In what way shall you humble yourselves? Answer (v. 7): by   "casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares for you." In   other words, the humblest thing in the world is to do what 1 Peter   4:19 says, "Entrust your soul to a faithful Creator." Casting your   anxieties on God means trusting the promise that he cares for you   and has the power and the wisdom to put that care to work in the   most glorious way.       That trust is the opposite of pride. It's the essence of   humility. It's the confidence that the mighty hand of God is not   over you to crush you but to care for you just like the promise   says. Don't be proud, but cast your anxieties on him because he   will care for you.       Whenever your heart starts to be anxious about the future   preach to your heart and say, "Heart, who do you think you are to   be afraid of the future and nullify the promise of God? No, heart,   I will not exalt myself with anxiety. I will humble myself in   peace and joy as I trust this precious and great promise of God --   he cares for me.
