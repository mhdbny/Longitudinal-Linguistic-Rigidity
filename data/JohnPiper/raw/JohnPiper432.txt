    February 12, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     A FAST FOR WATERS THAT DO NOT FAIL (Part1)   (Isaiah 58:1-12)               1 Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raiseyour voice like a trumpet,    And declare to My people their transgression, And to the houseof Jacob their sins. 2    Yet they seek Me day by day, and delight to know My ways,As a nation that has done    Thou righteousness, And has not forsaken the ordinance of theirGod. They ask Me for just    decisions, They delight in the nearness of God. 3 'Why have wefasted and Thou dost not    see? Why have we humbled ourselves and Thou dost not notice?'Behold, on the day of your    fast you find your desire, And drive hard all your workers. 4Behold, you fast for    contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist. You donot fast like you do today    to make your voice heard on high. 5 Is it a fast like thiswhich I choose, a day for    a man to humble himself? Is it for bowing one's head like areed, And for spreading out    sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast, even anacceptable day to the    Lord? 6 Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen thebonds of wickedness, To    undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free,And break every yoke? 7    Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry, And bringthe homeless poor into the    house; When you see the naked, to cover him; And not to hideyourself from your own flesh?    8 Then your light will break out like the dawn, And yourrecovery will speedily    spring forth; And your righteousness will go before you; Theglory of the Lord will be    your rear guard. 9 Then you will call, and the Lord willanswer; You will cry, and    He will say, 'Here I am.' If you remove the yoke from yourmidst, The pointing of the    finger, and speaking wickedness, 10 And if you give yourself tothe hungry, And satisfy    the desire of the afflicted, Then your light will rise indarkness, And your gloom will    become like midday. 11 And the Lord will continually guideyou, And satisfy your    desire in scorched places, And give strength to your bones; Andyou will be like a watered    garden, And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. 12And those from among    you will rebuild the ancient ruins; You will raise up the age-old foundations; And you    will be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of thestreets in which to dwell.              Introduction      John Chrysostom     One of the greatest preachers of the firstthousand years of the  Christian Church was John Chrysostom, the bishop of Constantinoplein the fourth century.  I mention him because he has left us one of the most sweepingstatements about the value  of fasting. He was known as an ascetic in an age of luxury inConstantinople and his  lifestyle offended the emperor Arcadius and his wife Eudoxia somuch that he was  eventually banished and died in AD 407. Of fasting he said,          Fasting is, as much as lies in us, animitation of the angles, a    contemning of things present, a school of prayer, a nourishmentof the soul, a bridle of    the mouth, an abatement of concupiscence: it mollifies rage, itappeases anger, it calms    the tempests of nature, it excites reason, it clears the mind,it disburthens the flesh,    it chases away night-pollutions, it frees from head-ache. Byfasting, a man gets composed    behaviour, free utterance of his tongue, right apprehensions ofhis mind.       Not all of those accolades are true foreveryone in every time of  fasting. For example, for some fasting will cause a headacherather than take it away. But  I want you to hear Chrysostom and the thousands of saints who haveproved the value of the  Lord&#146;s prophecy: when the Bridegroom is taken away then thedisciples will fast  (Matthew 9:15).    But what we began to see last week is that thereis danger in fasting. I  don&#146;t mean physical danger -- you can avoid that if youfollow simple guidelines (see  the sheet on the information table). What I mean is spiritualdangers. You can fast in a  way that will be very displeasing to the Lord and spirituallydestructive to yourself.     Last week we heard Jesus warn us that this was so.If you fast, for  example, to be seen by other people, he said, you have your rewardfrom them, and you will  not be answered by the Father. To prove our hearts he said that weshould take steps not  to be seen by others, but only by God: comb your hair, wash yourface and do not put on a  gloomy countenance. Then -- if your motives are pure -- yourFather who sees in secret  will reward you.    This week, and next week, we hear anotherwarning, this time from the  prophet Isaiah -- or more precisely from God through Isaiah. Thischapter is full of rich  associations for me. I see it not just as a fitting conclusion toour series on fasting,  but as a text associated with some very powerful experiences incertain people&#146;s  lives; and I see it as having a very significant bearing on theMaster Planning  Team&#146;s wrestling with what our priorities and focuses shouldbe as a church for the  rest of this decade.     Bill Leslie     One of the experiences I have in mind isthe experience of Bill  Leslie the former pastor of LaSalle Street Church in Chicago whodied not too long ago  after a long and remarkable ministry -- like the one described inIsaiah 58. He came to  the Twin Cities once and told of a near breakdown that he had andhow a spiritual mentor  directed him to this chapter. He said it was verses 10-11 thatsaved him from a dead end  street of exhaustion and burn-out.          And if you give yourself to the hungry, andsatisfy the desire of the    afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness, and your gloomwill become like midday.    And the Lord will continually guide you, and satisfy your desirein scorched places [like    urban Chicago], and give strength to your bones; and you will belike a watered garden,    and like a spring of water whose waters do not fail.       What struck Pastor Leslie so powerfully was thefact that if we pour  ourselves out for others, God promises to make us like a wateredgarden -- that is, we  will receive the water we need for refreshment. But even more: wewill thus be a spring of  water that does not fail -- for others, for the demanding,exhausting, draining ministry  of urban self-giving. This gave him a pattern of divine life thatgot him through his  crisis and kept him going for years more. I want us to see thisweek and next week that  this is a kind of fasting that the Lord wants to teach us.     Doug Nichols     The other experience that makes the chapterrich for me right now  is the connection that it has with Doug Nichols, the President ofAction International  Ministries. Doug is the man who wrote to Tom Steller last summerand suggested that our  church get an airplane and take a couple hundred people to Rwandato help bury the dead so  that doctors and nurses could do what they were sent to do. Hespoke at our Pastors&#146;  Conference a week or so ago, and gave one of the most stirringmessages I have heard in a  long time. Action International specializes in reaching streetchildren around the world.     To show you the kind of person he is he wroteme last week to thank me  for the conference and put a PS at the bottom of his letter:          In the last &#145;one minute&#146; that itpossibly took you to read    this letter, 28 children died of malnutrition and diseases thatcould have been easily    prevented. 1,667 die every hour, 40,000 children die daily!Please pray with ACTION for    more missionaries to take the Gospel to these children.       Doug was found to have colon cancer in April of1993. They gave him a  30% chance of living after his surgery and colostomy and radiationtreatments. Last fall  he got on a plane and went to Rwanda with our Dr. Mike Andersonand some others. His  non-Christian oncologist said he would die in Rwanda. Doug saidthat would be OK because  he is going to heaven. The oncologist called his surgeon tosolicit help in not letting  Doug go to Rwanda. The surgeon is a Christian and said,It&#146;s okay, Doug&#146;s  ready to die and go to heaven.     We got word here that Doug, was going -- withhis cancer and his  colostomy -- to Rwanda. I recall gathering in the prayer room withthe staff and very  specifically and being led to Isaiah 58:7-8, which we prayed forDoug:          Is [the fast I choose] not to divide yourbread with the hungry, and    bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked,to cover him; and not to    hide yourself from your own flesh? Then your light will breakout like the dawn, and your    recovery [i.e., your healing] will speedily spring forth.       We prayed very specifically that the feeding ofthe hungry and the  housing of the homeless in Rwanda would not kill but heal DougNichols.    From Rwanda Doug called his Jewish oncologistand said he was not dead.  And when he got back he had a battery of tests which resulted inthe assessment NED: no  evidence of disease. If he makes it to April -- the two year mark -- without recurrence of  the cancer, doctors give him a good chance of living out hisnormal span of life. Doug is  53.    So you can see that Isaiah 58 has some verysignificant associations in  my life. And I am praying that we will hear the message of thischapter for our church --  our Master Planning Vision for the next five years and beyond.There is something very  close to Jesus&#146; heart in this chapter. You can hear it comingout in his words in  Luke 4:18 (The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because Heanointed Me to preach the  gospel to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim release to thecaptives, and recovery of  sight to the blind, to set free those who are downtrodden.);and in Matthew 25:35  (I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I wasthirsty, and you gave Me  drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and youclothed Me; I was sick, and  you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.) andJohn 7:38 (He who  believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost beingshall flow rivers of  living water.') A trusting relationship with Jesus is theway Isaiah 58 will be  fulfilled in your life. The burden of this chapter pervades theministry of Jesus -- and  more and more I believe it should pervade our ministry as well.    Let&#146;s get into it and go as far as we cantoday and then return  next Sunday, Lord willing, and see what God has to say to us abouthow not to fast, and  how to fast.     Fasting: The Danger of SubstitutingReligious Fervor for Righteous  Living     In the first three verses God brings anindictment against his  people. He tells Isaiah to cry loudly and declare to the house ofJacob their sins. But  their sin is cloaked with an amazing veneer of religious fervor.This is what is so  stunning and sobering. Verse 2:          Yet they seek Me day by day, and delightto know My ways, as [i.e.,    as if they were] a nation that has done righteousness, and hasnot forsaken the ordinance    of their God.        In other words they worship as if they are arighteous and obedient  nation. And they have themselves persuaded that they really wantGod and his ways. This is  a terrible kind of delusion to live in.     He goes on near the end of verse 2:           They ask Me for just decisions,they delight in the nearness    of God.        So they want God to intervene for them withrighteous judgments. Things  are not going well -- as we will see in a moment. But they do notsee the real problem.  They love to come to worship. They talk the language of thenearness of God. They may even  have moving religious and esthetic experiences in their efforts todraw near to God. But  something is wrong. They express the frustration in verse three,but they don&#146;t know  what it is.     In verse 3 they say to God,           Why have we fasted and Thou dost not see?Why have we humbled [or:    afflicted] ourselves and Thou dost not notice?        So something is wrong and they are fasting tomake it right and it  isn&#146;t working, so something is doubly wrong. There is a totalof five religious  things mentioned in verses 2-3 that they are doing -- all in vain.In verse 2 it says (1)  they are seeking God; and (2) they delight to knowGod&#146;s ways; and (3)  they ask God for just decisions; and (4) theydelight in the nearness of  God; and in verse three (5) they fasting and humbling orafflicting themselves. All  of that and God tells Isaiah, Cry loudly, not softly, not quietly,but loudly, and declare  to my people their sins.    So here is a fasting that is not pleasing theLord. Here is worship  that is not pleasing the Lord. It is the kind of worship we do notwant to have at  Bethlehem. And yet what is wrong with seeking God, and delightingto know his ways, and  asking him for just decisions, and delighting in his nearness, andfasting and humbling  our selves before him? What is wrong with that? Why, that soundslike the very way we talk  about worship! Isn&#146;t that sobering? Doesn&#146;t that makeyou tremble? Doesn&#146;t  that make you want to get so real with God, you could never besurprised by the Lord in  this way -- with your most zealous religious practices and evendesires exposed as sham.    What&#146;s wrong with their worship?    God answers in the middle of verse 3:           Behold, on the day of your fast you findyour desire, and drive    hard all your workers. 4 Behold, you fast for contention andstrife and to strike with a    wicked fist. You do not fast like you do today to make yourvoice heard on high. 5 Is it a    fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to humble [or:afflict] himself? Is it for    bowing one's head like a reed, and for spreading out sackclothand ashes as a bed? Will    you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the Lord?        So here&#146;s the issue. The ethical,practical, relational  accompaniments of fasting -- or worship in general -- are the realtest of the  authenticity of the fasting and the worship. Monday is the proofof Sunday. God lists the  religious forms of their fasting: humbling or afflicting oneself(no food), bowing the  head like a reed, spreading out our sackcloth and ashes (cf. Psalm35:13). Then he lists  the ethical accompaniments of this fasting: you go after your ownpleasure (in some other  way besides eating), you drive hard all your workers and becomeirritable or contentious  and stir up strife and even go so far as to get into fights. AndGod asks, Is this  the fast that I choose? The answer is No.    So here we have another test of authenticity.Jesus said, If you are  fasting to be seen by others you have your reward. That&#146;s it.Isaiah says, If your  fasting leaves you self-indulgent in other areas, harsh towardyour employees, irritable  and contentious, then your fasting is not acceptable to God.It&#146;s not what he  chooses. God is mercifully warning us against the danger ofsubstituting religious fervor  for righteous living.    Think and pray about it this week so that whenwe come back together  next Sunday you will be ready to hear God&#146;s beautiful andempowering and freeing  alternative to this kind of hypocrisy. Think about it for the long-term implications for  worship in your life and in this church. No worship -- nopreaching, no singing, no  playing of instruments, no praying, no fasting, however intense orbeautiful -- that  leaves us harsh with our workers on Monday, or contentious withour spouses at home, or  self-indulgent in other areas of our lives, or angry enough to hitsomebody -- no worship  or fasting that leaves us like that is true, God-pleasingworship.    Don&#146;t make a mistake here: true fastingmay be a God-blessed means  of overcoming harshness at work, and contentiousness at home, andself-indulgence, and  anger. But if fasting ever becomes a religious cloak forminimizing or hiding those things  and letting them go on and on, then it becomes hypocrisy andoffensive to God.    Our prayer teams would love to pray with any ofyou this morning who  feel a special burden to pray about anything that threatens tomake your worship or your  fasting inauthentic. And, of course the thing that would make itmost inauthentic is  unbelief itself. So I urge you to go hard after the authentic lifethis morning. And then  come back next week and see what it looks like from thischapter.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
