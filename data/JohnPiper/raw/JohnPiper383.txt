       ANXIETIES: TO BE CAST NOT CARRIED    (1 Peter 5:1-11)        Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your      fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a      partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the      flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under      compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and      not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it      over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples      to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will      receive the unfading crown of glory. You younger men, likewise,      be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves      with humility toward one another, for God is opposed to the      proud, but gives grace to the humble. Humble yourselves,      therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you      at the proper time, casting all your anxiety upon Him, because      He cares for you. Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your      adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking      someone to devour. But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing      that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished      by your brethren who are in the world. And after you have      suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called      you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect,      confirm, strengthen and establish you. To Him be dominion      forever and ever. Amen.          
       The opposite of boldness is fear or anxiety. It's not   surprising then that God not only calls us to be bold for Christ   and his kingdom, but he also makes a provision for us to get rid   of our fear and anxiety. Giving us courage and taking our fear are   two ways of doing the same thing.       Today's text is not a direct call to boldness. It's a call not   to be anxious. And so it's an indirect call to boldness and   courage.       But there is something very unusual about this text. The threat   in this text that tempts us to be anxious is not explicitly prison   or injury or slander or plundering of property or loss of money.   The threat is humility. Or to put it another way, the reason Peter   deals with the problem of anxiety is because he is dealing with   the problem of humility. Somehow the command for humility makes   the command to cast our anxiety on God more urgent, more needed.       Notice this in the flow of thought from verses 5-7. The chapter   starts with a word to the elders of the church to shepherd the   flock willingly and eagerly and without being motivated by money.   Then the focus turns to the others in the church.       You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; (then to   all the church) and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility   toward one another, for God is opposed to the proud, but gives   grace to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the   mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time . . .       Now right here comes the connection between this call for   humility and the command to cast all your anxiety on God. The   command for humility seems to cause anxiety to rise and so Peter   deals with it.       The NIV and RSV put a period at the end of verse 6 and make   verse 7 into a new sentence. "Humble yourselves . . . Cast all   your anxiety on him." But that break obscures the connection. The   NASB and the KJV don't have a period because verse 7 does not   start a new sentence in the original Greek. It is part of the   sentence in verse 6 and continues with a participle: not, "Cast   all your anxiety on him . . ." but, " . . . casting all your   anxiety on him."       "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,   that he may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety   on him because He cares for you." Not: "Humble yourselves. And   cast your anxiety." But: "Humble yourselves . . . casting your   anxiety."       The point is that casting your anxiety on God is somehow part   humbling yourself. Casting your anxiety on God is crucial if you   are going to humble yourself under God's hand and clothe yourself   with humility toward each other. Casting your anxiety on God is   not simply a separate thing that you do after you humble yourself.   It's something you do in order to humble yourself, or in the   process of humbling yourself.       There is something about humbling yourself under God's hand and   humbling yourself before other people that makes casting all your   anxiety on God necessary. Or to say it another way, there is   something about casting your anxiety on God that makes humbling   yourself under God and before others possible.       It looks like humility is a threat that causes anxiety. And if   we are going to be humble with God and with each other, we are   going to have to cast our anxiety on God. That's the connection   between verse 7 and what goes before. "Clothe yourselves with   humility toward each other and humble yourselves under the mighty   hand of God by casting your anxiety on God."       But why does humility create anxiety? Why does humility take   courage? Why do we need someone to take our anxiety away in order   for us to be humble?       You can see the answer easily if you just start thinking of   some examples of humility. What does it mean to be humble? It   means, when you've made a mistake, admitting it and saying your   sorry. It means, when you are weak or sick or inadequate for a   task, not being too proud to ask for help. It means doing some   ordinary jobs and spending time with ordinary people and being   indifferent to accolades.       In other words, in all its forms humility is the risk of losing   face. Humility is the risk of not being noticed, not being   appreciated, not being praised and not being rewarded. Lowliness   runs the obvious risk of being looked down on.       And being looked down on is painful. Being unnoticed and   unappreciated is painful. Losing face is painful. Being made   little of is painful. And therefore humility causes anxiety. And   the command to be humble under God and to be clothed with humility   toward each other makes us anxious.       So if we are really going to be humble, we have to solve this   anxiety problem. If we are going to have the courage of humility   and the boldness of lowliness, someone is going to have to take   our anxiety away.       That's the point of verse 7: "Be humble by casting all your   anxiety on God." The secret of humility is being able to cast your   anxiety on God. Note the connection between humbling yourself   under God's mighty hand in verse 6 and casting your anxiety on God   in verse 7. God is the focus in both verses, and the connection is   this: before you can put yourself humbly under God's mighty hand,   you have to put your anxiety confidently in God's mighty hand.       There is a fearful cowering under the mighty hand of God for   the rebellious and the proud. But that is not what Peter is   calling for in verse 6. The humility Peter commands under God's   hand is the peaceful, confident humility that comes because we   have cast our anxiety on God with the confidence that he cares for   us.       I love these two images side by side: humbled and lowly under   the mighty hand of an infinitely holy and powerful God, and   confident and peaceful because that very God cares for us and   carries our anxiety. Before you bow down and step under him, cast   the burden of your anxiety on him!       Now what does it mean to cast your anxiety on God? How do you   do that?       This word "casting" in verse 7 occurs one other time in the New   Testament--in Luke 19:35, in exactly the same form. It's Palm   Sunday and the disciples have been sent to get the donkey for   Jesus to ride on. Then verse 35 says, "They brought it to Jesus,   and casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus on it."       So the meaning is simple and straight forward: if you have a   garment on and you want an animal to carry it for you, you "cast"   the garment on the animal. In this way you don't carry it anymore.   It's on the animal not on you. The donkey works for you and lifts   your load.       Well, God is willing to carry your anxieties the same way a   donkey carries your baggage. One of the greatest things about the   God of the Bible is that he commands us to let him work for us   before commanding us to work for him. "Come to me all you who   labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew   11:28). "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you"   (Psalm 55:22). "Even to your old age I am He, and to gray hairs I   will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and   will save" (Isaiah 46:4). "From of old no one has heard or   perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides thee, who   works for those who wait for him (Isaiah 64:4).       God wants to be a burden bearer because it demonstrates his   power and puts him in a class by himself among the so-called gods   of the universe. "No one has seen a God besides thee, who works   for those who wait for him." So throw the garments of your anxiety   onto him. He wants to carry it.        Practically how do you do that?        You do it by trusting the second half of verse 7 very   specifically in relation to your specific anxiety. The first half   of verse 7 says, ". . . casting all your anxiety on him . . ." and   the second half of the verse says, " . . . because he cares for   you."       Here is where the rubber meets the road. How do you practically   make the anxiety transfer from your back to God's back? The answer   is: trust that he cares for you. Believe this promise. Trust him.   It's a matter of practical trust.       That promise does not hang in the air. It is connected to a   command and the promise is meant to show you how to obey the   command. The command is, Cast your anxiety on God. The promise is,   God cares for you. That means, he cares about the thing that has   you worrying. He wants to be trusted for that.       So often we trust God in the abstract. Yes, he is a trustworthy   God. Yes, he can save sinners in general. Yes, he will work it all   out, generally speaking, for my good.       But a text like this means, Lay a specific anxiety on God.   Trust him specifically that he cares about that. Believe that he   is God. His purposes cannot be thwarted. "I know that you can do   all things, says Job, and no purpose of yours can be thwarted"   (Job 42:2).       When it says that he cares it means he will not stand by and   let things develop without his influence. It means he will act. He   will work. Not always the way we would. He's God. He sees a   thousand connections we don't see. The lost credit card might   result in an evening of searching and take you away from a TV   program that unbeknownst to you would have put a lustful desire in   your mind and made prayer unappealing so that you failed to seek   God's power and missed a golden opportunity to speak of Christ to   a ready colleague the next day, which because of that lost credit   card you did not miss. God sees a thousand connections we do not   see.       Casting your anxiety on God means trusting him for handling   this specific situation. If you believe that he cares (which is   what the promise says), and believe that he is God, then your   fears will be lifted.       There is one other thing to say about this act of casting   anxiety on God, namely, the connection with prayer. Philippians   4:6 says, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer   and supplication, let your request be made known to God. And the   peace of God which passes all comprehension will guard your hearts   and minds in Christ Jesus."       So 1 Peter 5:7 says, "Cast your anxiety on God by trusting that   he cares for you." And Philippians 4:6 says, "Cast your anxiety on   the Lord by praying and letting your requests be made known to   him." The connection is simple. Trusting that God cares about your   anxiety is expressed in prayer. Prayer is the trust turned toward   God and spoken.       Which brings us now to our new summer adventure for the next   hour of "praying the vision."--taking what we have seen of God and   his will and turning it into prayer.       We have been talking about boldness and courage and risk-taking   for some weeks. And we are planning a summer full of opportunities   to do just that--sports outreach, inviting people to the Gate,   survey teams, street witnessing teams, personal harvest   appointments, bar ministry, drama outreach. Every time you humble   yourself and love someone like this you run the risk of losing   face. What shall we do with this repeated threat of anxiety this   summer?       We will pray, every Sunday morning for the next 12 weeks for 45   minutes as an extension of the morning service. And we will trust   the promise of God--"I care about you . . . I love evangelism, and   when my people call upon me together I will pour out on them a   Spirit of peace and power."       *****        Ideas for prayer:               "With thanksgiving" (Phil. 4:6)--expressions of praise and      thanks that God is sovereign over our anxieties and is wise      enough and caring enough that we can entrust ourselves to      him.              Payers for humility and for more of the Spirit of the      lowly, servant, risk-taking Christ (Phil. 2;3-8).              Prayers for more faith in God's promises and that every      binding obstacle to joyful trust would be overcome.              Prayer for God to call people to all the outreach      ministries on the insert to the bulletin; that we would cast      our anxiety on God and hear his call.              Broaden prayers out to the summer ministries of other      churches and pray for the prosperity of God's kingdom in every      fellowship where Christ is truly named.              Broaden further to pray for courage and humility on the      front lines of world missions and that this summer would be a      period of powerful advance for Christ and his kingdom in Africa      and Asia and Europe and South America, as well as America.
