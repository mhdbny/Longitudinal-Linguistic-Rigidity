  April 20, 1986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning John Piper, Pastor Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   WHY HOPE? GOSPEL!  Colossians 1:15-23 15) He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation;16) for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible andinvisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities--allthings were created through him and for him. 17) He is before all things,and in him all things hold together. 18) He is the head of the body, thechurch; he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everythinghe might be pre-eminent. 19) For in him all the fullness of God was pleasedto dwell, 20) and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whetheron earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. 21) And you,who once were estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, 22) he hasnow reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present youholy and blameless and irreproachable before him, 23) provided that you continuein the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospelwhich you heard, which has been preached to every creature under heaven,and of which I, Paul became a minister. Sometimes we fail to eat the main course of a Biblical meal because we chokeon the hors d'oeuvres. The meal is set before us -- perhaps early in themorning alone in our study, or late at night when all the others are asleep,or perhaps on Sunday morning in a sermon. And the main course is magnificent.You catch a glimpse of it. The smell begins to make you hungry. The anticipationrises. And then you choke on the hors d'oeuvres. And in the end you get upfrom the banquet of Biblical truth and leave the table frustrated and hungry. What I mean by the main course of the meal is the rich, deep, hope-givingmessage of Biblical texts--what verse 23 here calls "the hope of the gospel".And what I mean by the hors d'oeuvres are problems that you see in the text-- things that don't make sense, things that seem to contradict other partsof the Bible, or go against your experience. Haven't we all had the experience in our devotional reading of the Biblethat some great and wonderful truth lies before us, but we are so disturbedby the problem in the verse before it that we can't get beyond the hors d'oeuvresand enjoy the main meal? This happens to me far more often than I wish itwould. Well the main course this morning is too valuable to miss. It's the phrase"the hope of the gospel" in verse 23. So let me begin by trying to make threehors d'oeuvres in today's text tasty rather than troublesome. In fact whatwe will see is that they are not really side dishes after all. Good people often choke on parts verses 15, 20 and 23. In verse 15 it may sound like Christ is part of creation and therefore nottruly God: "He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of allcreation." Jehovah's Witnesses would take it to mean that Christ is partof creation. In verse 20 it may sound like all creatures are eventually going to be saved,so that there will be no one in hell in the end: (starting at verse 19) "Forin him (Christ) all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and throughhim to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, makingpeace by the blood of his cross." So universalists, ever since Origen inthe third century, have taken this to mean that all creatures will be savedand none condemned. And in verse 23 (at the end) what can Paul mean that the gospel has beenpreached to every creature under heaven? He hadn't even gotten to Spain yet(Romans 15:24). It's little things like this that we choke on, and then neverget to the main course in the "hope of the gospel." Well, let me just point you in the direction of an answer to each of thesequestions without going into detail. And we will find ourselves before weknow it in the main course. First, the hors d'oeuvre in verse 15. Is Christ pictured as part of creation,and therefore not as God? It says, "He is the image of the invisible God,the first-born of all creation." The term "first-born" is a term of preeminenceand dignity. For example in Psalm 89:27 it is used of David. God says, "Iwill make him the first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth." Sohere in Colossians 1:15 it may simply have reference to Christ's unique andtremendously exalted status as the bearer of God's image -- "He is the imageof the invisible of God, the first-born..." But when it says, "First-born of all creation," does it mean that he is partof creation or over creation? (The NIV paraphrases "of" as "over" and answersthe question for you.) Is he "first-born of all creation" like this is apulpit of wood? Or is he "first-born of all creation" like Ronald Reaganis the commander in chief of the armed forces -- that is, over the armedforces? "Of" is a very ambiguous word by itself. Well, it is not by itself. And the answer to our question is given in thenext verse. Notice how verse 16 begins. It begins with the word "for". Soit supports or explains the previous verse. Notice how: Christ "is the first-bornof all creation, FOR in him (or: by him) all things were created." If Paulwere trying to say that Christ was part of creation, he would not have supportedit by saying that Christ created all things. Verse 16 clearly teaches thatChrist is the "first-born of all creation" not in the sense that he is partof creation but in the sense that he is OVER all creation. "Without him wasnot anything made that was made" (John 1:3). There is no reason to choke on this hors d'oeuvre. In fact it is a magnificentmeal in itself, if we had time to serve it up -- that our Lord Jesus is notonly our Savior but our Maker. You were created by Christ. And that shouldintensify your trust and obedience and worship. But now we must hasten onto the next possible problem. In verses 19-20 some people choke on the possibility that Paul is teachinguniversalism, namely, that all creatures will eventually be saved and nonewill be punished forever. It says, "For in him (i.e., Christ) all the fullnessof God was pleased to dwell (or: God was pleased to have all his fullnessdwell in him) and (v. 20) through him to reconcile to himself all things,whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross." Does this mean that one day God will reconcile to himself all unbelieverswho have ever lived and even the devil? I don't think so. That would certainlycontradict things he says elsewhere (e.g. 2 Thessalonians 1:9). Let me suggestone possible solution. Colossians 3:11 gives a helpful clue. In 3:10 Paul is describing Christiansas people who have "put on the new nature, which is being renewed in knowledgeafter the image of its Creator." Then verse 11 begins with the word "here"in RSV and NIV (literally: "where") to show that what he is about to sayis limited in its scope to the sphere of this renewed humanity he was justasking about in verse 10. He says, "Here there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised,barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all, and in all." Nowif you took the sentence,"Christ is all and in all," by itself, you mightsay that it taught universalism: "Christ is all and in all human beings withoutexception." But we know that is not what he means because the verse beginswith "here" -- that is here in the sphere of the church; "here" -- in thenew humanity that Christ is creating, he is all and in all. This is the way I think we are to understand Colossians 1:20. Look how theparagraph is organized. The scope of verse 15-17 is all creation. The wholeuniverse is in view. And the point is that Christ is preeminent over allcreation, because he made it and he holds it all together. But then in verses 18-21 the focus shifts and the scope is no longer thewhole universe but the new creation, namely the church. Notice how verse18 turns from creation to the church: "He is the head of the body, the church."Then it speaks of his being the first-born from the dead, that is he wasthe great first fruits of the new creation, the church that will one dayrise from the dead and fill the earth with his glory. Then, in this context of the church, we read verse 20, that "he will reconcileall things to himself in heaven and on earth." So I think the "all things"in verse 20 should be limited the same way the "all" in 3:11 was limited.Christ created all things in the old creation and he is preeminent over all(that is the point of verses 15-17). And everything that belongs to the newcreation he will reconcile to himself and be head over all, (that is thepoint of verses 18-20). So there is no need to choke on this hors d'oeuvre either. This too is ameal all by itself. Our Lord Jesus is the sovereign master over all creation,and he is head over all the church. Nothing in heaven or on earth that Godhas appointed to be a part of the new creation in Christ will fail to bereconciled to him. The Lord reigns. And he will save his people and subduehis enemies. That brings us very close to the main course for today. But briefly letslook and one other "side dish" that could stick in our throat. In verse 23 Paul refers to "the hope of the gospel which you heard, whichhas been preached to every creature under heaven." What does that mean --that the gospel has been preached to every creature under heaven? Paul knows full well that the gospel has not yet reached to all the peoplesof the earth. He is writing from Rome. And his intention, according to Romans15:20-24, is to go on to Spain, if he gets out of jail, because he wantsto preach where Christ has never been named. Literally we could translate the last part of verse 23, "the Gospel whichyou heard, the one preached in all creation under heaven." This wouldn'timply that the job is done. It would simply imply that it is the gospel'sdestiny to be preached everywhere, and that this is in fact happening. Verse6 suggests that this is what Paul means. He refers to the gospel "which hascome to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing."The point in both texts is that the gospel is not for just one group, butfor the world; and that it is in fact making great headway through the world. Tertullian, who was born only 100 years after Colossians was written wasable to say about the spread of the gospel, "We [Christians] are but ofyesterday, and yet we already fill your cities, islands, camps, your palace,senate, and forum. We have left you only your temples." So I hope nobody chokes on these three hors d'oeuvres. In fact I hope thatyou will see that they are not side dishes after all. I wouldn't have spentmore than half our time on them if they were. Let's summarize and see whatI mean. Christ is no mere creature. He is the very image of the living God. "In himthe whole fullness of deity dwells bodily" (2:9). He is very God of veryGod, begotten not made. All things were made through him and for him. Heis before all things and in him all things hold together. If these thingswere not so, if our Lord were not the Lord of glory there would be no Christiangospel, for Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:4 that our gospel is "the gospelof the glory of Christ, who is the likeness of God." So our first hors d'oeuvre is no mere side dish. It belongs to the very essenceof the Gospel. Rob Christ of his divine preeminence over all creation andthere is no Christian gospel. Angels and men cannot atone for sin! Only theGod-man can save your life. Nor was the second hors d'oeuvre a mere side dish. It has pleased God theFather not merely to make the old creation through the power of his Son,but also to make (i.e. reconcile) a new creation by the death of his Son. Notice how verse 21 says that you and I were estranged and hostile towardGod. That is the condition of the whole old creation. Rebellion against Godreigns in the hearts of men -- you and me included. We are rebels by naturejust as much as any Khomene or Khadafy! The gospel is the message of verse22: "Christ has now reconciled us in his body of flesh by his death, in orderto present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him." By the death of his Son, God is now creating a new race of holy people whohave given up their hostility to God. God aims for Jesus not merely to bethe first-born over all creation by virtue of his authority and power, butalso the head of a new creation by virtue of his sacrifice and love. So that hors d'oeuvre is no side dish either. It belongs to the very heartof the gospel. It IS the gospel. If God didn't overcome my hostility andestrangement by the blood of Christ, it would never be overcome, I wouldnever be a new creature, and there would be no good news in all the world. And the last hors d'oeuvre too turns out to be part of the gospel itself.This gospel is being preached in all creation under heaven. The gospel isfor everybody! It belongs to the very heart of the gospel that you don'thave to be Jewish, or anglo saxon, or free or male, or even good in orderto be saved by the gospel. "The gospel is the power of God unto salvationfor everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek" (Romans1:16). Therefore this gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world.This is not an interesting sidelight (a side dish). If the gospel did notrun and win victories in the world, it would not be the power of God to save,and it would not be gospel. The gospel is not merely a proclamation of good news. It is the power ofGod to save. It comes not only in word but in power and in the Holy Spirit(1 Thessalonians 1:5). It is the instrument of God's effectual call (2Thessalonians 2:14). It is the occasion of his regenerating power (1 Peter1:23, as we will see next week). It accomplishes what God sends it forthto do. The gospel is the word of God. It is the voice of the Lord. And we know that         The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars...       The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness...       The voice of the Lord strips the forests bare;       and in his temple all cry "Glory!" (Psalm 29)   Paul refers in Colossians 1:23 to "the hope of the gospel." And there isno sweeter message of hope in all the world than to hear God announce thatwhen you get up in the morning miserable and depressed with a sense of guiltand estrangement before a holy God, you can go to bed that very night --this very night -- with a quiet and peaceful heart knowing that every sinyou have ever committed and ever will commit is forgiven and you are reconciledto the Almighty by the death of his Son. That's the free offer of the gospel! If last week we saw that we were chosen by grace, and called by grace, andsanctified by grace, and sustained in faith by grace, and glorified by grace,today we learn that all that grace was purchased by the blood of the crossand is emphatically a grace for estranged and hostile sinners. And the gospel is the good news that there is hope for sinners, the worstof sinners -- the hope of forgiveness (a weeping harlot saved by faith);the hope of reconciliation (a broken prodigal coming home); the hope of holiness(a leper cleansed by the touch of Jesus). But the hope of the Gospel is more. It is a world wide hope, and nothingelse will satisfy our hearts in the end. It is the voice of the Lord thatstrips the forests bare. It is living and active and sharper than a two-edgedsword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit (Hebrews 4:11-12). Itis like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces(Jeremiah 23:29). It goes forth from his mouth and does not return empty,but accomplishes that for which he sent it (Isaiah 55:11). The grass withersand the flowers fall but the word of our God stands for ever (Isaiah 40:8). And therefore it will reach to every people and tongue and tribe and nation;the ransomed will be called; the full number of the gentiles will come in;the eyes of all Israel will be opened; and the Son of Man will come on theclouds of heaven with power and great glory. The wheat and the tares willbe divided: one into the furnace of fire, the other into the masters granary.And those who have believed the gospel will shine like the Son in the kingdomof their Father. And they shall reign for ever and ever in light. This is the great global hope of the gospel! Let him who is thirsty come.Let anyone who desires take the water of life without price. Receive thegospel. Stand in it. Hold it fast. There is no other hope than "the hopeof the gospel"! Amen!   Copyright 1996,1999 John Piper    Piper's Notes
