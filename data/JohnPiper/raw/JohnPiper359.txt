 October 4, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       IDOLATRY, THE LORD'S SUPPER,    AND THE BODY OF CHRIST    (1 Corinthians 10:14-22)         Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak      as to wise men; you judge what I say. Is not the cup of      blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is      not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?      Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we      all partake of the one bread. Look at the nation Israel; are      not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? What do      I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything or      that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things which      the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to      God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons. You      cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you      cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of      demons. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not      stronger than He, are we?         What 1 Corinthians 10 is about is the way the Corinthians had   overestimated the power of the Lord's Supper as sacramental food,   and had underestimated the purpose of the Lord's Supper as   spiritual fellowship with Christ.        In other words, they saw eating the bread and drinking the cup   as a kind of sacramental antidote to any ill effects that might   come from tasting the poison of idolatry. And so they   overestimated the power of the Lord's supper.        And they failed to see that the purpose of eating the bread and   drinking the cup was to share in the life of Christ and to   fellowship with him as one body. And so they underestimated the   purpose of the Lord's supper, and thus its true power in the fight   against idolatry and sin.        And both their overestimation of its power to immunize, and   their underestimation of its purpose to nourish fellowship with   Christ, made them vulnerable to sin. And not only to sin, but to   entanglement with demons.        And so what we are dealing with here is something tremendously   serious in the life of the church. The Lord's Supper is precious   beyond words as a gift from Jesus to his church not only as a   reminder of his death for us, but also as an occasion when he   draws near to nourish our intimacy with him and strengthen us by   his shed blood and his broken body. And yet it is possible to   overestimate the power of the Lord's Supper and actually make it   an encouragement for sinning.        And so I want us to unpack these two mistakes that the   Corinthians were making. The aim is that we not make them   ourselves, but rather have a Biblically balanced view of the   Lord's supper.        The first thing we need to notice is that idolatry is the theme   that holds this chapter together. Our text began in verse 14 with   the command, "Therefore, my beloved, flee idolatry." Then again in   verse 19 Paul says, "What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed   to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?" Then in verse   28 he says, "If anyone should say to you, 'This is meat sacrificed   to idols,' do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed   you, and for conscience' sake." Then notice back nearer to the   beginning of the chapter in verse 7: "And do not be idolaters, as   some of them (the Israelites) were."        So running through the whole chapter is this concern with   idolatry there in Corinth: verses 7,14,19,28. The pagan sacrifices   to idols in Corinth were a tough issue for the church. Do you eat   the meat used in such sacrifices when it's resold in the market?   Do you go to dinner in a person's house when they might use such   meat? Can you participate in the ceremonies themselves? Idolatry   was not a merely theoretical issue in Corinth. It was a real life   everyday problem. And it still is today, though the idols and the   sacrifices have changed.         1. The first mistake some of the Corinthians made was   that they overestimated the power of the Lord's Supper to make   them immune to the destructive effects of this idolatry.            Paul takes this up in verses 1-14. What Paul shows here is that   the Corinthians were saying, "I eat God's sacramental food. I   drink God's sacramental drink. I've been baptized into Christ with   water. I am safe and secure and so nothing can threaten me, not   even participation with my old friends in the feasts of idolatry.   The Lord's supper and baptism make me secure."        Now that is a grave mistake. And the way Paul shows it up is by   comparing the blessing of the Christian ordinances of baptism and   the Lord's Supper to the blessing of God on Israel when they went   through the water of the Red Sea and ate miraculous manna in the   wilderness and drank miraculous water from desert rocks. Watch how   he gives his warning to the Corinthians who are relying on the   power of food and drink to keep them safe from God's judgment.         1 I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that      our fathers were all under the cloud (i.e., the pillar of cloud      that led Israel), and all passed through the sea (i.e., the Red      Sea at the Exodus from Egypt); 2 and all were baptized into      Moses in the cloud and in the sea (i.e., Israelites were      blessed by God with a kind of "through the water" deliverance      just as remarkable as yours); 3 and all ate the same spiritual      food; 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were      drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the      rock was Christ  (i.e., the manna and the miracle water      were types, as verse 6 says, of what was to come, namely, the      food and drink of the Lord's supper) . 5 Nevertheless, with      most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low      in the wilderness (i.e. died in the wilderness and were kept      out of the promised land). 6 Now these things happened as      examples (or types) for us, that we should not crave evil      things, as they also craved. 7 And do not be idolaters, as some      of them were.         Now we can see the mistake the Corinthians were making. They   were overestimating the power of the Lord's Supper (and baptism)   by thinking that if they just ate this food and drank this drink,   God would be pleased with them and they would be safe from his   judgment, even if they went on participating in the idol feasts of   their Corinthian friends.        This is frighteningly close to the way millions of professing   Christians view the Lord's Supper today--as a grace dispenser, a   sacramental antidote that immunizes against all forms of worldly   idolatry. If you show up and eat and drink, you are safe. And the   rest of your life can be just as entangled in secularism and sin   as all the rest of the world.        To this Paul says, No. You are not safe. Verse 12: "Let him who   thinks that he stand take heed lest he fall." The Lord's Supper   does not protect from the judgment of God if we go on craving and   grumbling and idolizing the way the world does. Israelites came to   ruin in the wilderness (v. 5). And the same thing could happen to   you.        That was their first mistake: they overestimated the power of   the Lord's Supper to protect them from the destructive effects of   idolatry. They substituted sacramentalism for personal   holiness.         2. The other mistake they made was that they   underestimated the purpose of the Lord's Supper as spiritual   fellowship with Christ.         The Lord's Supper is not an external, automatic impartation of   divine protection. It is an experience of personal, spiritual   fellowship with Christ. In the eating and drinking by faith we   nourish ourselves on the blessings purchased by Christ's shed   blood and broken body. And so this Supper really does help protect   us from destruction by making us want to flee idolatry not by   making us secure in idolatry.        Let's see how Paul brings this out. Verse 14 says, "Therefore,   my beloved, flee from idolatry." Then he asks them to judge   carefully what he says (v. 15), and then in verse 16 he gives his   argument that should empower them to flee idolatry--and it's an   argument from the nature of the Lord's Supper. This Supper really   is powerful, but not the way the Corinthians were using it. He   says, "Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the   blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the   body of Christ?"        Now what does this mean? This is what will make us want to flee   idolatry--flee from the pagan feasts where idols are worshipped   (v. 14) because in the Lord's Supper we are sharers in the blood   of Christ and sharers in the body of Christ (v. 16). What does   "sharing in the blood of Christ" and "sharing in the body of   Christ" mean? Does it mean that we drink the physical blood and   eat the physical body of Christ? Or is there another meaning?   There are two clues in the immediate context, one in verse 18 and   one in verse 20. Both these verses use this idea of "sharing".   (See also 1:9.)        In verse 18 Paul says, "Look at the nation of Israel; are not   those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?" Now this does   not mean that they eat the altar. It means that they share in the   benefits of what happens on the altar. On the altar God removes   guilt and forgives sin and makes peace and establishes a   fellowship of thanksgiving and love. So to be a sharer in the   altar is to share in all those things that God is doing at the   altar.        This is probably what Paul means in verse 16 when he says that   the bread is a sharing in the body of Christ and the cup is a   sharing in the blood of Christ. When Christ was sacrificed on the   cross and shed his blood and gave his body for us, God was   removing guilt and forgiving sin and making peace and establishing   fellowship with all who believe. And the purpose of the Lord's   Supper is to receive from Christ the nourishment and strength and   hope and joy that come from feasting our souls on all that he   purchased for us on the cross, especially his own fellowship. We   share in the body and the blood by sharing in the benefits that   they bought--including, as verse 17 says, our unity in the body of   Christ (as we saw last week from Ephesians 2:11-22).        Then verse 20 uses this word "sharers" again, and helps us see   more of what verse 16 means. Start in verse 19: "What do I mean   then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an   idol is anything? (Here he is guarding himself from a   misinterpretation: he is not against participation in idol feasts   because idols of wood and stone are anything.) No (v. 20 says),   but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they   sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I do not want you to   become sharers in demons."        So here is the key word again: sharers. What does it mean?   Again it does not mean that we eat demons when we eat meat offered   to idols. It means that we get entangled in their power. We submit   to them. We become vulnerable to them. We enter into some kind of   fellowship. We affirm them in some way and give them leeway in our   lives.        So, that is also part of the meaning in verse 16, when it says   that the cup is a sharing in the blood of Christ and the bread is   a sharing in the body of Christ. It is a getting entangled with   Christ and a submitting to Christ and being vulnerable to him and   giving him leeway in your life and entering into fellowship with   him. This is why we call the Lord's Supper "Communion." It is a   communing with Christ rather than with demons.        And so what the Corinthians were underestimating was the real   power of the Lord's Supper that comes from its true purpose,   namely, to deepen and strengthen our participation in the benefits   of the cross, or to nourish our fellowship with Christ himself.   And the reason this is powerful against idolatry is given in verse   21: "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons;   you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of   demons." You can't. Because when you truly partake of the cup and   the table of the Lord, you are being nourished and satisfied by   the Lord, and loving the Lord, and delighting in the Lord, and   trusting the Lord and fellowshipping with the Lord. That's what it   means to share in the blood and body of Christ--to sit with Jesus   at the banquet of the benefits of his death. In that kind of   experience idols and demons lose all their attraction and all   their power.        I conclude with this word of application. Today's text   concerning the Lord's Supper is really about what you do when you   are not at the Lord's Supper. It's about the threat of idolatry in   your life every day. It's a word from God that says, What you just   experienced with Christ in the Lord's Supper dare not--cannot--be   profaned this week by your sitting down at the feast of idols. You   know what they are in your life. So I say in the name of Christ   and in the words of Paul: Flee from idolatry this week. For at   this table this morning you have sat with Jesus at the banquet of   the benefits of his death, and such an experience dare not be   profaned.
