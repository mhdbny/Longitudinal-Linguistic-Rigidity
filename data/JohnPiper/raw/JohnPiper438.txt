    April 9, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     The Depths of Christ&#146;s Love: ItsLavish Benefits   (1 John 3:1)     See how great a love the Father has bestowedupon us,    that we should be called children of God.      Introduction: two childhood scenarios     I went to see the last game of the seasonbetween our high school  basketball team and Central Baptist a few weeks ago. And I watcheda little drama of life  happen before the game started -- something that almost all of ushave experienced that  leaves a lasting imprint on our hearts. I was watching the littlechildren run around  before the game in this unfamiliar gymnasium. Little by little thechildren gravitated off  to the side to their parents. Finally only one was left on thecourt when it suddenly  dawned on him that he couldn&#146;t see anybody that he knew. AndI watched his face turn  from carefree happiness to panic and tears as he called out,Daddy! Daddy! So  I stepped out and put my arm around him and pointed him toward hisDaddy, and said,  There he is. It&#146;s OK.    Now suppose the situation is different. Supposeit&#146;s Rwanda a few  months ago. Or Burundi last week. And you are a little boy playingin your village. And  suddenly you hear screams and running. And you turn to look for afamiliar face and all  you see is angry, shouting men, running toward you with machetes.You run as fast as you  can and hide under a basket that your mother wove. And when youcome out, everyone is gone  or dead. Your mother is dead. Your father is dead. Your brothersand sisters are dead.    You sob yourself to sleep on the body of yourmother as the sun goes  down. You wake up to realize that you are not only terrified thatthe enemy might come  back, but that you are very thirsty and hungry. And it hits youthat there is no one to  take care of you or save you from the enemies or from the wildanimals or sickness. You  are utterly alone. You find some bananas in a house and eat them.And another day passes.  You don&#146;t have any idea what to do. And you begin to thinkyou will just die.    Then you hear a sound and turn to see a tallman standing in the dirt  square. He calls out to you in your own language and says,Don&#146;t be afraid. I  want to help you. You want to run, but, there is no place torun, and nobody to run  to. He comes over to you and pulls some bread out of his pouch andgives you some. You eat  it. And then he gives you some water from his waterskin.     He says, I tried to stop them. Andyou notice the  lacerations on his arms and head. He says, If you come withme, I&#146;ll take care  of you. I&#146;m very sorry about your mother and father.I&#146;ll help you bury  them. As you work together to bury the dead, you begin totalk to him. And you learn  that he belongs to the tribe that slaughtered your village andfamily. You also learn that  he and his little son were in the tribal meeting when the banddecided to raid your  village. They disagreed with the raid, and put themselves betweentheir fellow kinsman and  your village. As a result the band of raiders killed theman&#146;s son as he tried to  protect your village. And suddenly you feel an overwhelming sensethat this man loves you.  It cost him his son to try to save you.    Not only that, it gradually comes out that yourvillage has made  horrible raids on his relatives in years past, and that your ownfather was an arch enemy  of this very man and had tried several times to kill him. At firstthat makes you very  afraid. But then you realize, that this man is trying to save youin spite of all this  animosity between your tribes and families. And your sense ofbeing loved becomes  stronger. Hope starts to rise in your broken heart, that maybethere would be life beyond  the loss of your mother and father and brothers and sisters.    You agree to go with the man. And over the nextseveral months you  learn the almost unbelievable truth that this man has a universityeducation from Oxford;  that he is a very wealthy business man with homes in Burundi andLondon, and a sheep farm  in Yorkshire, north of Leeds. You don&#146;t understand it all,but over time you learn  that that not only has he rescued you from death, but he issupplying all your needs  beyond what you could have imagined. He takes you into his home inBurundi and you take  long vacations with him to London and the sheep farm. And withevery new lavish gift you  feel more and more loved. He rescued you; it cost him hisson&#146;s life in the process.  You were part of a tribe that hated him and his father. And now,as the years go by, you  become old enough to understand that, on top of all this, he hastaken care of all the  affairs for you to be his legal son. And you learn that he hassigned over to you all his  wealth as an inheritance.     More than a rescue     I think this is the kind of seriousthinking that lay behind  John&#146;s words in 1 John 3:1,           See how great a love the Father hasbestowed upon us, that we    should be called children of God.        Not only did it cost him his Son to save usfrom sin and death and hell  (John 3:16; 1 John 3:16); and not only were we enemies so that Godhad to propitiate his  own righteous anger in order to save us (1 John 4:10); but he wentway beyond the love of  rescue and the love of sacrifice and the love of clemency to hisenemies. In and through  all this he had a greater design. He showed us another kind oflove beyond all that. He  might have rescued us, sacrificed for us, forgiven us and not goneany further. But  instead he showed us another kind of love -- he took us into hisfamily. He made us to be  called  children of God .     Don&#146;t take this for granted. First of all,he might not have saved  us at all. He might have said, Enemies don&#146;t deservesaving, and that&#146;s  that. He might have said, My Son is too precious topay for angels, let alone  humans, let alone ungodly, rebellious humans. But he alsomight have said, I  will save them from hell, and forgive their sins, and give themeternal existence -- on  another planet, and I will communicate with them through angels.Nothing in us, or in the  nature of the world required that God would go beyond allredeeming, forgiving, rescuing,  healing love to this extreme -- namely, to an adopting love. Alove that will not settle  for a truce, or a formal gratitude or distant planet of materialpleasure, but will press  all the way in to make you  a child of God . A member of thefamily.     More than adoption     But even that is not an adequatedescription of this kind of love.  When John writes about our becoming children of God he is notthinking mainly in terms of  adoption. He is thinking in terms of something more profound. Heis thinking of new birth.  There is no human analogy to this. If I find a child and want totake him into my home, I  cannot cause the child to be born again. I take him and I love himwith the personality  and temperament that he has from his biological parents. Iinfluence with love, but I do  not get into the very nature of the person and change it.    But God does. The love that John has in viewhere in 1 John 3:1 is not  the love that merely takes care of paper work and adopts. Thatwould be amazing beyond  words -- to be adopted into God&#146;s family. And Paul doesdescribe it this way. But  John sees more. God does not adopt. He moves in, by his Spirit,his seed, John calls it,  and imparts something of himself to us, so that we take on afamily resemblance.    1 John 3:9 puts it like this:           No one who is born of God practices sin,because His seed abides in    him; and he cannot [go on practicing] sin, because he is born ofGod. By this we know the    children of God.        If you are a child of God this morning you areso by adoption, yes, and  by more than adoption, by new birth. 1 John 5:1 says it this way,          Whoever believes that Jesus is theChrist    [has    been]    born of God; and whoever loves theFather loves the child born    of Him.        So the love of God for us goes beyond the storyof the wealthy business  man who took care of all the legal matters to adopt the orphanfrom Burundi. God will not  stop in his aggressive pursuit of closeness and communion until hehas penetrated our very  souls and planted his seed in us and given us a new nature, not adivine one -- we are not  God -- but a nature like God&#146;s -- in the image of God.    Paul tells us that this was God&#146;s planlong before the world was  made. He saw the fall of man into sin; he saw the history ofredemption; and he saw the  incarnation and death of his Son; and in it all he aimed at this.Romans 8:29 says,           Whom  [God]  foreknew, He alsopredestined  to become     conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren.        God predestined it. He planned it long ago.What? That his Son would  have many brothers and sisters in the age to come. How? Byadoption? Yes (Eph. 1:5). But  more than adoption. He predestined us to be conformed to the imageof his Son. That is, he  caused us to be born again (Gal. 4:29); he made us new creaturesin Christ (Gal. 6:15); he  put his Spirit in us and began a transforming work from insidethat would shape us into  the family likeness of God. He wanted us in the family. And hewanted us to be so at home  that he went beyond adoption, and gave us a second birth.    Now what does this mean for us? Let me mentionthree things.     1. Children of God are led by the Spirit ofGod     It means that we are indwelt and led by theHoly Spirit. Romans  8:14,           For all who are being led by the Spiritof God, these are sons of    God.         This is what it means to be a child of God --to be so united to God by  his Spirit that he is in us leading us -- that is, he transformsus by the renewing of our  minds so that we value what he values and assess things the way hedoes and prove what is  the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect (Rom.12:1-2).     2. Children of God are lights in the world     It means that you are different enough fromthe world that you  shine like a light -- like a little fragment of God&#146;s brightcharacter of truth and  righteousness and love. Philippians 2:15 says that you are           children of God . . . in the midst of acrooked and perverse    generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world.        To be a child of God is to be in one sense themost fully human that  you can be -- what God was aiming at in creating us in the firstplace. But in another  sense being a child of God sets you off from the world of humansthat are not born of God  and do not have his Spirit. That&#146;s why 1 John 3:1b says thatthe world does not  know us. Our values and priorities have been sorevolutionized by conformity to  Jesus that we don&#146;t make sense to the world. But this islight, and desperately  needed, and by grace some see and give glory to our Father inheaven, as Jesus said (Matt.  5:16).     3. Children of God are heirs of all things     Being God&#146;s children means that we aregoing to inherit what  God owns. Paul says this in Romans 8:16-17, The SpiritHimself bears witness with  our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirsalso, heirs of God and  fellow heirs with Christ. We are fellow heirs with Christ.But what is Christ an  heir of? Hebrews 1:2 tells us:           In these last days  [God]  hasspoken to us in  His     Son, whom He appointed  heir  of all things, through whomalso He made the world.        So very simply Christ is heir of all things.And we are fellow heirs  with him -- of all things.    Paul says this very forcefully in 1 Corinthians3:21-23. He says to the  Christians,           All things belong to you, whether Paul orApollos or Cephas or the    world or life or death or things present or things to come; allthings belong to you, and    you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.        O, how many things there are to say about thistruth! What an impact it  should have on our lives -- the way we think about possessions andthe need to  own things -- the way we think about boasting andpride and the importance of  having   instead of  being . I have the feeling that God revealedthis to us so that in  one sense we could get it out of our system and focus on otherthings -- All right,  you like to own things? -- he says. You like to havethings? You think  that&#146;s important? OK, here&#146;s the deal. You owneverything. It&#146;s just a  matter of time. And your investment savvy has nothing to do withit. So now relax and live  for what counts.    And yet there is probably another reason forthe revelation of our  inheritance as children of God. It&#146;s God&#146;s way ofstooping down and saying how  much he loves us by the lavish benefits he gives. 1 John 3:1 says,          See how great a love the Father hasbestowed on us, that we should    be called the children of God.        And if children then heirs -- heirs of allthings. The measure of our  inheritance as the children of God is one measure of the love thatGod has for us. And the  measure of our inheritance is the entire creation.    In Romans 8:21 Paul says,           The creation itself will be set free fromits slavery to corruption    into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.        Which means that the entire universe will beredeemed for the sake of  the children of God.      A brief look at all creation     Our planet earth is a small part of a solarsystem that is 7.3  billion miles across. This solar system is a little speck in thegalaxy called the Milky  Way which is 80,000 light years across. A light year is how farlight travels in a year.  Light travels at 186,000 miles per second. So our galaxy is480,000 trillion miles across.  The nearest star to us, Alpha Centauri would take 4.3 years to getto traveling at the  speed of light. The nearest neighboring galaxy would take 2.2million years to get to at  the speed of light.    All creation will be set free into the gloriousliberty of the children  of God. It is yours, and you are Christ&#146;s and Christ isGod&#146;s. God has revealed  these things to us, not so that we will fall in love with stars,but so that we will see  something of the magnitude of his love.           See how great a love the Father hasbestowed upon us, that we    should be called children of God.        And if children, then heirs -- heirs of allthings. Not for the sake of  all things, but for the sake of comprehending the love of God.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
