    January 1, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     Prayer, Fasting and the Course of History   (Acts 13:1-4)           Now there were at Antioch, in the churchthat was there, prophets    and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, andLucius of Cyrene, and Manaen    who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. Andwhile they were ministering    to the Lord and  fasting , the Holy Spirit said, Setapart for Me Barnabas and    Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when theyhad  fasted  and    prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. So,being sent out by the Holy    Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed toCyprus.              I begin this morning a series of messages onthe Biblical practice of  fasting. This is not new for us at Bethlehem. We have taught on itbefore and we have  called for fasting especially during prayer week in years gone by.But when we did the  survey in the morning service several weeks ago we found that 40%of those in attendance  that morning had been at Bethlehem three years or less. Which maymean that fasting is a  Biblical discipline you have not thought about much and havepracticed even less, since it  isn't a widespread corporate practice in the evangelicalmovement.    I expect to dwell on this much-neglectedBiblical and spiritual  discipline at least through the month of January and perhapslonger if the Lord leads. If  you have read the Bethlehem Star you know that I am calling us tofast one 24 hour period  a week through this month as we begin 1995, namely from Tuesdayafter supper through  Wednesday lunch. Together we would skip breakfast and lunch onWednesday and devote those  two meal-times, if possible, to fasting-prayer that 1995 would bea year of great  awakening in the Body of Christ; a revival of holiness andhappiness and prayer and  faithfulness and fruitfulness in ministering to each other andreaching the perishing. My  prayer is that by means of these messages you will hear God's callin my call to fast.     You may understand better why I believe this isGod's will for us now  if we get right into our text. The situation is that Saul (Paul)and Barnabas and some of  the other leaders in the church in Antioch were worshipping --ministering to the Lord --  and fasting (v. 2). Judging by what happened we may assume, Ithink, that the burden that  drove them to fast was this: Where do we go from here as achurch? They were  fasting to seek the leading of the Holy Spirit in the direction oftheir mission. You  could call it Master Planning if you want to. The upshot was moremagnificent than any  other Master Planning effort the church has ever undertaken.     They were hungry enough for God's leading thatthey wanted to say it  with the hunger of their bodies and not just the hunger of theirhearts. We want  your leading, O God! O Holy Spirit, what is your will for themission of this  church?     Do you know what boggles my mind about MasterPlanning at Bethlehem.  Most of the questions we need to answer are not answeredexplicitly in the Bible. The ones  with clear Biblical answers don't require a Master Planning teamto discern. The questions  that press on us are the kind of questions that the leaders inAntioch faced: Lord,  shall we begin a world mission venture? Should it be now? Shouldwe send some of our own  teachers? Should it be Saul or Simeon or Niger or Lucius orBarnabas? Should we send two  or three or four? Which way should we send them: by land or bysea? Should we fund them  fully or expect them to work for their keep or hope that therewill be sons of peace in  the towns where they go who will feed them? Should other churchesjoin with us? Etc.     Most of the questions that planning teams haveto answer are of that  kind. Where will we get the answers? Do we have anything to learnfrom the fact that these  deeply spiritual early Christians worshipped and fasted and prayedas they sought the  leading of the Lord?    Consider four observations from Acts 13:1-4.     1. This fasting was after Christ's coming.     I simply point this out lest someone saythat fasting was a part of  the Old Testament spirituality but not of New Testamentspirituality. We will tackle this  issue head on next week and ask, Is Fasting part of the oldwineskin that needs to  be discarded so that the new wine of the kingdom will not burstthe wineskins and be  lost? The apparent answer is that Saul and Barnabas and theothers in Antioch did  not think fasting was the old wineskin.      2. This fasting was done by a grouptogether.     Another concern with fasting is that Jesuswarned against fasting  to be seen by men (Matt. 6:17-18). He said, Your Father whosees in secret will  reward you. But Saul and Barnabas evidently do not takeJesus to mean that group  fasting is evil, even though people often know you are fastingwhen you are doing it as  part of a group -- as when a church-wide fast is called, the way Iam calling for a fast  on Wednesdays through the month of January.     Evidently the church leaders at Antioch takeJesus to mean not that we  sin if someone knows that we are fasting, but that we sin if ourmotive is to be known for  our fasting so that men applaud us. Group fasting has marked God'speople all through  Biblical and post-Biblical history.     3. This fasting proved to be an occasion forthe Spirit's special  guidance.     Verse 2 says,          And while they were ministering to the Lordand  fasting , the    Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul forthe work to which I have    called them. 3 Then, when they had  fasted  and prayed andlaid their hands on them,    they sent them away.       In reporting it this way, Luke clearly wants usto see a connection  between the worship, prayer and fasting on the one hand and thedecisive guidance of the  Holy Spirit on the other.     Without evidence to the contrary I would saythat this teaches us the  value of worship-fasting-prayer in the earnest pursuit of God'swill for our lives and the  life of our church.     4. This fasting changed the course ofhistory.     It is almost impossible to overstate thehistorical importance of  this moment in Antioch in the history of the world. Before thisword from the Holy Spirit  there seems to have been no organized mission of the church beyondthe eastern seacoast of  the Mediterranean. Before this, Paul had made no missionaryjourneys westward to Asian  Minor, Greece or Rome or Spain. Before this Paul had not writtenany of his letters which  were all the result of his missionary travels beginning here.     This moment of prayer and fasting resulted in amissions movement that  would make Christianity the dominant religion of the Roman empirewithin two and a half  centuries and would yield 1.3 billion adherents of the Christianreligion today with a  Christian witness in virtually every country of the world. And 13our of the 29 books of  the New Testament were the result of the ministry that waslaunched in this moment of  prayer and fasting.    So I think is it fair to say that God waspleased to make worship and  prayer and fasting the launching pad for a mission that wouldchange the course of world  history. Is there not a lesson there for us?    It had happened before and it would happenagain and again in history.    For example, in 2 Chronicles 20 the Moabitesand Ammonites and Meunites  came against Jehoshaphat the king of Judah. It was a terrifyinghorde of violent people.  What could the people do? What direction should they turn. Verse 3says,          Jehoshaphat was afraid and turned hisattention to seek the Lord; and  proclaimed    a fast  throughout all Judah. 4 So Judah gathered together toseek help from the Lord;    they even came from all the cities of Judah to seek the Lord.       So there was a great nationwide fast for divineguidance and  deliverance. In the midst of that fasting assembly, verses 14-15says,           the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel. . . and he said,    Listen, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem andKing Jehoshaphat: thus says    the Lord to you, Do not fear or be dismayed because of thisgreat multitude, for the    battle is not yours but God's.        The next day when the people of Judah went out,they found that the  people of Moab and Ammon had destroyed one another, and it tookthem three days to gather  the spoil, there was so much. What looked like defeat and calamitywas overnight turned  into stunning triumph.    Again the course of history was changed throughthe fasting of God's  people.    John Wesley tells us in his journal of asimilar kind of deliverance in  1756. The king of Britain called for a day of solemn prayer andfasting because of a  threatened invasion of the French. Wesley wrote,          The fast day was a glorious day, such asLondon has scarce seen since    the Restoration. Every church in the city was more than full,and a solemn seriousness sat    on every face. Surely God heareth prayer, and there will yet bea lengthening of our    tranquillity.       Then in a footnote he added later,Humility was turned into  national rejoicing for the threatened invasion by the French wasaverted. It would  not be difficult to multiply story after story from the Bible andafter the Bible to show  that fasting and prayer have changed the course of history. Wewill see in the coming  weeks that this is especially true in the way fasting figures intotimes of great revival.    But let me try to put our focus on fasting andour call to fast in the  wider context of what God seems to be doing today, and then whathe may be doing at  Bethlehem.    In November one of you came to me and said youthought God might be  calling us to a day a week of fasting as a church. Would I prayabout it and try to  discern if this was of the Lord for us at this time? I hadrecently been invited by Bill  Bright, the head of Campus Crusade, to join 600 others in OrlandoDecember 5-7 for two  days of prayer and fasting for awakening in our land and for theadvance of the kingdom  around the world.    I decided to go, with the desire that God mightlead me concerning how  fasting should figure into this present moment in the history ofour church. Bill Bright  said that he had completed a 40 day fast last summer and had feltled to call this time of  fasting and prayer in the hope of rekindling the practice offasting-prayer throughout the  church in America.    One of the insights I got in Orlando was thatthere are three elements  in Acts 13:1-3 -- worship, prayer and fasting. In our day therehas been a remarkable  resurgence of worship and prayer. Tens of thousands ofcongregations around the world are  experiencing more vibrant, freer more engaging worship in the last20 years. And the  prayer movements around the world are unprecedented in number andscope. In our own state  the Minnesota Prayer Coalition is unprecedented in pulling thebody of Christ together to  pray for the reviving of Christ's church and the advance of hiskingdom.    But there is not yet a comparable resurgence ofthe practice of fasting  as there has been with worship and prayer. Bill Bright suggestedthat God may will that  all three be in place and that the church be humbled and hungrywith fasting before he  blesses us as fully as he means to. It is remarkable how neglectedthis spiritual practice  is.    The first thing they did in Orlando was openthe microphones for some  of the people to say why they had come. I was listening with myear attuned to our  situation here and the question of whether we should call for aday of fasting each week.  The second person to stand up said he was from Promise Keepers andthat he was there  because he believed fasting was crucial and that Promise Keeperswere seriously  considering calling the men to fast a day a week, namely,Wednesday. Later in the meeting  Paul Cedar of the Free Church said that historically the churchhas often made weekly  fasting a part of her life. He wondered if we should again.    When I got back Bob Hamlett showed me thatPromise Keepers were in fact  born in the atmosphere of fasting. In the fall publication of Menof Action it says,          In 1990 Coach McCartney asked 72 men tocommit to pray and fast through    lunch every Wednesday [which is what I am calling for], prayingspecifically that Almighty    God would stir the hearts of men to pursue Jesus Christ. Theboard, leadership team, and    many of the staff are recommited to this end, and we invite youto join us.       Well, I am happy to say to Promise Keepers andto Bill Bright and I  believe to thousands of other believers around the world,especially in places like South  Korea, I am very eager to join you. And I am calling our church tojoin you as well.    These are wonderfully hope-filled days atBethlehem. I will explain  next week from Matthew 9:14-17 why I think why hope-filled peoplewill want to fast. In  the mean time I invite you to do several things. Purchase and bereading  God's Chosen  Fast  by Arthur Wallis (published by Christian LiteratureCrusade), pray about how the  Lord might want you to join in the special prayer times this week,including the night of  prayer this Friday, and seek the Lord concerning his call to fastin your life.
