 April 5, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        GOD'S INVINCIBLE PURPOSE:    FOUNDATIONS FOR FULL ASSURANCE:    "God called us into Life and Hope"    (1 Corinthians 1:18-25)         For the word of the cross is folly to those who      are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of      God. For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,      and the cleverness of the clever I will thwart." Where is the      wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this      age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For      since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through      wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to      save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek      wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to      Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both      Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.      For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness      of God is stronger than men.                This series of messages was born in Hebrews 6:11 which says,   "We desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in   realizing the full assurance of hope to the end." In simpler words   that means: God wants every one of you to be persistent and   passionate in your pursuit of full assurance. He doesn't want you   to live with fear about the future. He doesn't want you to be   uncertain that you have eternal life.        He wants every one of his children to live and die with the   full assurance of hope--like my father-in-law did as he approached   his death a little over a week ago. A few days before he died Dr.   Henry wrote a letter to my father and said, "Pam and I recognize   the sovereignty of God and are pleased to be used in whatever   manner He sees fit for His greatest glory." This is the way the   saints talk when they enjoy the full assurance of hope.        That's what God says you can have. The way we have been   pursuing it in these weeks together is to focus our attention not   on ourselves and our emotional ups and downs, but on the   invincible purpose of God. I have stressed the paradox that if we   can redirect our attention away from the subjective sensations of   assurance onto the objective foundations of assurance, the   sensations themselves will be deeper and stronger.        So we have been looking steadfastly on what God has done,   objectively, outside ourselves to save us. We have seen that he   chose us freely and unconditionally in Christ Jesus before the   foundation of the world. He predestined us to be conformed to the   likeness of his Son in holiness and love. He vindicated the worth   of his glory in the death of his Son so that he could pass over   God-belittling sins without belittling God. He laid the foundation   for justifying the ungodly by laying all our sins on Jesus. And he   worked a great reconciliation between himself and us when all his   holy wrath against us was drained to the last drop at the   cross.         And today we look at a sixth work of God that he   undertakes for our salvation--a sixth foundation for full   assurance, namely, the omnipotent, free, compelling call of God.            At first glance the call of God does not look like a foundation   for assurance. If somebody calls you on the phone and invites you   to dinner is that really a foundation of assurance that you will   get there, or even that you will want to get there? So we have   some work to do here so that you can see why the call of God to   eternal life is in fact very different from a human invitation to   dinner. It is a powerful, irrevocable foundation for full   assurance. It is an objective saving work of God that overcomes   everything in its path and creates what it commands.        To see the full force of this great work of God let's do what   verse 26 says to do: "Consider your call!"         Consider five things about you call .          1. God is the one who calls.          1 Corinthians 1:9, "God is faithful, by whom you were called   into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord." So its   clear this call we are talking about is God's call. He is the one   who calls. He always does it through the gospel. 2 Thessalonians   2:14 says, "He called you through our gospel." The call of God is   not exactly the same as the preaching of word of the gospel (which   we will see in a moment) but it never comes without the gospel.   God's call is what happens when the gospel comes with irresistible   force. It's the gospel with an omnipotent supercharge.          2. The call of God is effective; it creates what it   commands.          This is what makes God's call so different from a phone call   inviting us for dinner. God's call comes with the power to do what   it demands. To see this you have to distinguish this call of God   from the general preaching of the gospel or witnessing to a   friend. The call of God may or may not come in those acts of   witness.        Look at verses 22-24, "The Jews demand signs, and Greeks seek   wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews   and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and   Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."        Consider carefully what's happening here. Paul preaches Christ   crucified. He tells the story of Jesus dying to save sinners. He   offers Christ to everyone who will receive him as the power and   the wisdom of God. So in one crucial sense Paul and God are   calling all people to take Christ into their lives as power and   wisdom. And that's the way we should witness and   preach--indiscriminately, to Jew and Gentile and every race and   people and tongue and tribe and nation.        When we do, the same thing happens that happened when Paul   preached. Some listeners stumble over the gospel as unacceptable.   Some say it is foolishness. But some respond and say, "This Christ   is the true power of God and the true wisdom of God." And they   believe and are saved.        But what makes the difference? The answer is in verse 24:   Christ is a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but "to   those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of   God and the wisdom of God." In other words, the preaching of the   gospel is not exactly the same as the call of God. All the Jews   and Greeks were hearing the preaching of the gospel. But some were   rejecting it. But some were accepting it. Who were they? They were   the ones that God called. "To those who were called, both Jews and   Greeks, Christ (was received as) the power of God and the wisdom   of God."        So the call of God is not like a phone call inviting us to   dinner. That's what the gospel is. All are invited to dinner. And   whosoever will may come. But the call of God is what happens when   the gospel comes with irresistible force. It's the gospel with an   omnipotent supercharge. It creates the response it commands,   namely faith.        Paul teaches this in that great verse 30 in Romans 8: "Those   whom he predestined he also called and those whom he called he   also justified." Notice that everyone who is called is justified.   How can this be, since "we are justified by faith" as Romans 5:1   says? The answer is that the call of God creates what it commands,   namely, faith. All the called are justified because all the called   believe. The gospel comes with an omnipotent supercharge and their   hearts are changed and they say, "Christ is the power and the   wisdom of God!"        Romans 4:17 describes this supercharged, omnipotent call of God   like this: "He gives life to the dead and calls into existence   things that do not exist." He calls things that are not as though   they were--and they come into existence.        You can see the power of this call if you compare it to the   power of your own call. If someone is sleeping when they should be   awake you might call out, "WAKE UP!" And the very call itself will   create what you command.        Well, that's what God does. Only God does it when we are dead   in trespasses and sins (Eph. 2:2-5). He doesn't just wake us from   sleep with his call. He wakes us from spiritual death, the way he   did Lazarus from physical death. John 12:17 says Jesus "called   Lazarus out of the tomb." He called, "Lazarus, come forth!" And   the omnipotent call of God created what he commanded, namely,   life. It's the same thing God did when he created the universe. He   said, "Let there be light!" And there was light.        If you are a Christian this morning, that is the way you became   one. God did it. You were spiritually dead. Christ and his word   and his life-style and his promises meant very little to you. You   did not love him or trust him or enjoy him. You were dead to all   these things. Then one day God called you. And you rose from the   dead. And the sprouts of spiritual life broke through the ground   and you tasted true faith and love and joy in God for the first   time. Because God did it. I want you to know that this morning so   that you give him the glory. And so that you feel yourself   standing in the rock solid foundation of the assurance of faith in   the call of God. It may have been shattering and cataclysmic like   a thunderbolt of power. Or it may have been as quiet as the way a   stem of grass splits a concrete sidewalk.        But if you today can say from your heart, "I embrace Jesus as   the power of God and the wisdom of God in my life," then you have   been called. It has happened to you. You have been created a new   person by the call of God. That's the second thing to consider   about your call. The call of God is effective; it creates what it   commands.        The next thing to consider about your call is why God does it   this way. What's the purpose of an omnipotent, supercharged call   that creates what it commands? The answer:          3. The call of God is designed to guarantee God's   purpose in election.          Ephesians 1:4 says that "God chose us in Christ before the   foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in   love." He predestined us to be his children and to be like his Son   (Eph. 1:5; Romans 8:29). But we are all by nature unholy and   blameworthy and unloving and not like Christ. So God's purpose of   election will fail if he does not call us with infallible power   and create in us the faith and the holiness and love that he   predestined us to have. The call of God guarantees the purpose of   God in election.        Consider Romans 9:11. Here Paul says explicitly that the call   of God is designed to guarantee the purpose of election. He says   that Jacob was chosen not Esau "in order that God's purpose of   election might continue not because of works, but because of the   one who calls." The purpose of God in election stands because of   the call of God in salvation.        The same thing is taught in 2 Timothy 1:9. "God saved us and   called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but   according to his own purpose and the grace he gave us in Christ   Jesus ages ago." The call of God accords with purpose and grace   given ages ago. The call is infallibly effective, in order to   guarantee an infallible purpose of election. God does not elect   and predestine and then stand back and wonder if his electing   purpose will come to pass. He brings it to pass with his   omnipotent call that creates the faith it commands.        That's the meaning of Romans 8:30: "Those whom he predestined   he also called." The call is the guarantee of the predestined   effect. That's the third thing to consider about your call: it is   designed to guarantee the purpose of God in election.          4. God's call brings you into eternal life and   light and freedom and glory.          1 Timothy 6:12, "Take hold of eternal life to which you were   called when you made the good confession in the presence of many   witnesses."        1 Peter 2:9, "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy   nation, God's own people that you may declare the wonderful deeds   of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous   light."        Galatians 5:13, "You were called to freedom, brethren."        1 Peter 5:10, "After you have suffered a little while, the God   of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will   himself restore, establish and strengthen you" (cf. 1 Thess. 2:12;   2 Thess. 2:14; 2 Peter 1:3).        In other words, virtually everything we hope for--life, light,   freedom, glory--is ours because of the call of God that comes to   us with omnipotent power in the gospel, creating what it commands.   If you embrace Christ this morning as the wisdom and power of God,   that is what happened to you and that is what belongs to you.          5. The call of God is an irrevocable foundation for   full assurance.          Romans 11:29 says, "The gifts and call of God are irrevocable."   God does not reverse, or repeal or cancel his call. The whole   point of an omnipotent call that creates what it commands is to   guarantee God's invincible purpose in the lives of his people. If   God has called you, you are justified, and if you are justified   you will be glorified.        Jesus put it like this in John 10:27-29: "My sheep hear my   voice and I know them and they follow me; and I give them eternal   life, and they shall never perish and no one shall snatch them out   of my hand. My Father who has given them to me is greater than all   and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand." Those   whom God calls God keeps (Jude 1).        If you are outside this experience today, realize how utterly   dependent you are on the call of God in your life. Humble yourself   before him, wake up from the dead, hear the gospel call: believe   on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved (Acts 16:32; Romans   10:13).        
        Note: In John 10:3-5,16,27 Jesus is the one who calls. But this   is not a contradiction of 1 Corinthians 1:9 or Galatians 1:6,15,   etc. because 1) the call of Jesus is the call of God. "The word   which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me" (John   14:24). 2) No one responds to Jesus's call without the inner   drawing of the Father (John 6:44,65) which is the irresistible   call of God the Father within the call of Jesus.
