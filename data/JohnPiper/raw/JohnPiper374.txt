       A MODEL OF COVENANT EXHORTATION    (1 Thessalonians 4:1-12)        Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you      in the Lord Jesus, that, as you received from us instruction as      to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually      do walk), that you may excel still more. For you know what      commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.      For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that      you abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you know how      to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in      lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God; and      that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter      because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we      also told you before and solemnly warned you. For God has not      called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification.      Consequently, he who rejects this is not rejecting man but the      God who gives His Holy Spirit to you. Now as to the love of the      brethren, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you      yourselves are taught by God to love one another; for indeed      you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all      Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more, and      to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to      your own business and work with your hands, just as we      commanded you; so that you may behave properly toward outsiders      and not be in any need.         
       Sometimes we make the mistake of thinking that the only people   who need to be called to account are those who have one foot in   sin already. We think that if a person is doing well the only   thing they need is either to be praised or perhaps they need   nothing at all from us. We tend to think of exhortations and   promptings and urgings and warnings as things you use only for the   wayward.       I say that's a mistake because experience and scripture teach   us that every believer needs regular exhortations, and challenges   and wakening calls and stirrings and inspiration and warnings and   cautions.       Yesterday morning I was on the phone with a friend in the Los   Angeles area and he was stunned again by another well-known pastor   who, after 31 years of ministry, at the age of 61, was exposed in   sexual misconduct. My friend said, "John, I don't think it would   have happened if he was in a small group of men who had held him   more closely accountable." But we Americans (and humans) do not   like people pressing in our soul-space. And we are all the more   hesitant to tread in when things are going well.       But that is not the Biblical approach. The Biblical writers do   not get into people's lives only when things are falling apart;   they get in when things are going well. And they exhort them and   urge them and stir them up to keep on doing well and to do better   and better.       You see this twice in our text: in verse 1 and verses 9-10.   Verse 1:        Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you      in the Lord Jesus, that, as you received from us instruction as      to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually      do walk), that you may excel still more.          Notice the phrase, "just as you actually do walk," followed by,   "that you may excel still more." Paul's "exhorting" is not mainly   prompted by hearing that the church is failing. It is prompted by   the belief that successful churches and successful people need to   be exhorted to press on and be vigilant in faithfulness and   growth.       The same thing turns up in verses 9-10:        Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no      need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught      by God to love one another; for indeed you do practice it      toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge      you, brethren, to excel still more,         Even when someone seems to be in such close fellowship with God   that it can be said they are "taught by God" (not just man), and   even when someone is practicing love not in a narrow limited way   but in large and expansive ways, do not think that there is no use   in exhortation and prodding and inspiration and motivation for   those people. These Thessalonians were being "taught by God" to   love each other (v. 9). And their love is extending well beyond   their own community to believers throughout the district of   Macedonia (v. 10). And yet Paul said, "We urge you (we exhort you)   to abound still more and more."       So in verse 1 he says, "You are walking in a way to please God;   excel still more" and in verse 10 he says, "You are loving as God   has taught you; excel still more."       So it's not true that the only people who will benefit from   exhortation and accountability are those who have one foot already   in sin. Exhortation, encouragement and accountability will benefit   all of us. Hebrews 3:12-13 makes this very explicit:        Take care, brethren, lest there should be in any      one of you an evil, unbelieving heart . . . But encourage one      another day after day . . . lest any one of you be hardened by      the deceitfulness of sin.         No one has run the race so long or so well--not even 31 years   of ministry--that he can say, "I don't need exhortation or   accountability or warnings or encouragement."       1 Thessalonians 4:1 is a model of exhortation and   accountability that we could well follow in our covenant life   together as a church. What I mean by model of exhortation and   accountability is mainly it shows us the way small groups might   use the church covenant in stirring each other up to excel in   faith and hope and love.       Notice four things in this model:       1. There is a way to walk--or to live--to please God. Notice in   the middle of the verse the words: "how you ought to walk and to   please God." There is a way to walk that pleases God.       2. The Thessalonians had "received" that way of life and had   made a good start in walking in it. ". . . as you received from us   how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you actually do   walk." Verse 2 reminds them what they had received: "For you know   what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus."       So verse 2 says Paul had given commandments which summed up   "how you ought to walk and to please God," and verse 1 says that   the Thessalonians had "received" them and submitted to them in a   changed life.       Another way to put this is that the people had been called by   God into the new covenant and were fulfilling the terms of the   covenant in love and holiness to one another. You remember that   one of the marks of the new covenant is that God writes the law on   the heart. Well that's what Paul was referring to in verse 9: "You   have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are   taught by God to love one another."       Verse 2 says that Paul had given commandments, and verse 1 says   that those commandments are "the way to walk and to please God."   But verse 9 clarifies that it was God himself who was writing   these commandments on their heart so that they loved to do them,   and did not experience them as a letter that kills but as the   power of the Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6; cf. Rom. 6:17).       So the first thing we've seen about this model of exhortation   and accountability is that there is a way to walk to please God.   and the second thing to notice in this model is that when this   covenant way of life is presented by Paul to the Thessalonians it   is "received" or accepted by the Thessalonians, and it is taught   by God himself, and they begin to walk in it.       3. The third thing to notice is that Paul "requests" something   from them and "exhorts" them. Notice how the verse begins with   these key words: "request" and "exhort." "Finally then, brethren,   we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus . . ."       This is what God wants us to do for each other at Bethlehem,   just as Paul set an example for us here in his letter. First,   there is a way to walk and to please God. Second, we have heard   and received it. It is summed up in our church covenant. Third,   there is a "requesting and exhorting" that should go on here.       If the church were not a covenant community in which people   voluntarily make a covenant to live a certain way for each other   and for the world and for the Lord, then "requesting" and   "exhorting" like this would be intruding. But if we have made a   covenant with each other to be one body in Christ and to model our   life on scriptures like these, then "requesting" and "exhorting"   is not intruding, it is love and faithfulness and loyalty.       4. Finally, notice that the aim of the requesting and exhorting   in verse 1 is (at the end of the verse) "that you may excel still   more and more." In what? In what you "received" from the   beginning. Not in a long list of new commandments. You received   (what Paul calls in Romans 6:17) the "form of teaching"--the "how   you ought to walk and please God." You received the terms of the   covenant.       That is what I urge you to walk in still more and more. Yes, it   is God who teaches you (v. 9). But he uses words spoken by men. "I   planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth" (1 Cor. 3:6).   Humans "request" and humans "exhort" but God writes the terms of   the covenant on the heart. God gives the heartfelt obedience.       So here we have a model for how to use our church covenant   (among other ways) in our small groups. First, we acknowledge that   there is a way to walk and to please God. Second, we receive   it--we accept the covenant and make our commitment to one another   with it. Third, we "request" and "exhort" each other again and   again. We don't coast. We keep the covenant before us and stir   each other up. Fourth, we do this not just for the weak but also   for the strong, not just for the wayward but also for the   stalwarts, not just for the failing but also for the successful,   not just for the cold but also for the fervent, not just for the   laymen but also for the pastors. We exhort each other day after   day to "excel still more."       No one is above sinning and covenant breaking. And the best   protection against it is not coasting or even commending. The best   protection is stretching forward. This is why Paul requested and   exhorted successful saints to "excel more and more" in love and   holiness.       The Church Covenant should not be something we read   periodically and forget about in between. It is a summary of "the   way we ought to walk and to please God."       It is not meant to be exhaustive. It is meant to steer a middle   way between excessive detail that goes beyond scripture and vague   generalizations that give no guidance. I think our Covenant does   this admirably.       Take a few examples from paragraph 3.       "We also engage to maintain family and secret devotions." It   does not say what they should look like or when you should do them   or how often. And so it honors the tremendous variety of ways that   we all meet God and deal with him and cultivate our devotion to   him. But it also honors Matthew 6:5-6 that there is a closet of   prayer to go into where our Father sees in secret what our hearts   desire.       So in our small groups we may say to each other without being   picky: How are you doing in your secret devotions? And we may   encourage each other and inspire each other with stories and   testimonies and Biblical promises.       Or again: "&#91;We engage&#93; . . . to educate our children in   the Christian faith." Again: it does not say that home-schooling   is the only way or that Sunday School is mandatory or that   Christian Schools are better for kids than State Schools in every   case. The Covenant is not a blue print for all the details of   life. It leaves room for discussion and differences as we grow   together. But it does honor Ephesians 6:4, "Fathers, bring them up   in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."       And in our small groups (with single parents or married   parents) we can ask how it is going in teaching the children. What   is working? What isn't? Can I pray for you and your children? What   is the cutting edge of crisis right now?       Or again: "&#91;We engage&#93; . . . to seek the salvation of   our kindred and acquaintances." Again it does not say whether this   is by prayer or by loving service or by "The Four laws or by   "Quest for Joy" or by long friendships or immediate   confrontations. But what it does is take seriously Romans 10:1,   where Paul says, "My heart's desire and prayer to God for &#91;my   kinsmen&#93; is that they might be saved."       So in our small groups we can say, "How did the lunch meeting   go last week? How can we pray for your witness this week?"       And so it goes in our Church Covenant, steering what I think is   a beautiful course between excessive and unbiblical detail on the   one hand and vague generalization on the other hand. It is a   balance between the opposite errors of legalism and lawlessness.       Let me finish reading it with you so that you can see this in   the rest of paragraph three.       (3) We also engage . . . to walk circumspectly in the world; to   be just in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and   exemplary in our deportment, to avoid all tattling, backbiting and   excessive anger &#91;that is, to avoid gossiping and idle chatter   about people, and unkind vengeful remarks about others, and anger   that comes from offended egos or breeds bitterness without   redemptive effect; and finally, a sentence that we added ourselves   in 1982&#93;; to seek God's help in abstaining from all drugs,   food, drink, and practices which bring unwarranted harm to the   body or jeopardize our own or another's faith.       Through and through this Covenant does not settle the detailed   questions of life (Which drugs? Which food? Which drink? Which   practices?), but it sends us back again to the guidance of the   Scriptures and the illumination of the Holy Spirit, and to the   corporate wisdom of the body of Christ.       Which simply means that this Covenant is part of the New   Covenant and depends on 1 Thessalonians 4:9 coming true at   Bethlehem: are we being taught by God or only by man? Is the   covenant being written on our hearts, or is it only on paper?       There is a way to walk that pleases God. We have made a   covenant to walk in that way. Let us exhort each other and hold   each other accountable. And let us pray that in it all God himself   will be our teacher and write the covenant on our hearts and make   us excel more and more.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
