 April 26, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       GOD'S INVINCIBLE PURPOSE    FOUNDATIONS FOR FULL ASSURANCE:    "Behold, I make all things New"    (Revelation 21:1-8)         Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the      first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea      was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming      down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for      her husband; and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,      "Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with      them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be      with them; he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and      death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor      crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed      away." And he who sat upon the throne said, "Behold I make all      things new." Also he said, "Write this, for these words are      trustworthy and true." And he said to me, "It is done! I am the      Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty      I will give from the fountain of the water of life without      payment. He who conquers shall have this heritage, and I will      be his God and he shall be my son. But a for the cowardly, the      faithless, the polluted, as for murderers, fornicators,      sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot shall be in the      lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second      death."                Richard Baxter was a very effective pastor in England in the   1600's. His whole adult life was spent battling one sickness after   the other. He was harassed by a constant cough, frequent   nosebleeds, migraine headaches, digestive ailments, kidney stones,   and 
 gallstones. He believed in supernatural healing and   said several times he was restored to fruitful labor because of   God's direct intervention. He said once a cancerous looking tumor   in his throat vanished while he was in the pulpit testifying to   God's mercies in his own life. Yet bodily suffering was with him   to the end, and he once said that from the age of 21 he was   "seldom an hour free from pain."        One of the effects of this suffering was to make him intensely   conscious of how temporary his life is and how inevitable death   is. Once, when he was 35, he was bed-bound by one of his diseases   and thought he would probably not recover. He began to meditate on   the joys of heaven and the age to come in preparation for leaving   this world. He focussed especially on "the hope of glory" and   began to write his thoughts.        To his surprise he recovered and his thoughts became a book   entitled  The Saints' Everlasting Rest.  He took up the   practice of meditating on heaven a half hour each day because of   the powerful impact it had on his life. He commended the same   thing to his readers. He said,        If you would have light and heat, why are you not more      in the sunshine? For want of this recourse to heaven, your soul      is as a lamp not lighted, and your duty as a sacrifice without      fire. Fetch one coal daily from this altar, and see if your      offering will not burn. . . . Keep close to this reviving fire,      and see if your affections will not be warm. 1         This is good advice. Paul told us to do this in Colossians   3:1-4.         1 If then you have been raised with Christ, seek      the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right      hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things that are above, not on      things that are on earth. 3 For you have died, and your life is      hid with Christ in God. 4 When Christ who is our life appears,      then you also will appear with him in glory.          In other words, if last week's message is true and our   resurrection with Christ is so sure as virtually to have already   happened then we are to live in the constant consciousness that we   are citizens of another age. We are to set our minds much on that   age. We are not to be conformed to this age, but to be transformed   by the renewing of our minds. And that renewing means conformed to   the newness of the age to come, because God says in our text,   "Behold I make all things new" (Rev. 21:5).        So I want us to take one more step this morning in our series   on "The Invincible Purpose of God: Foundations for Full   Assurance." I want us to focus on the objective reality of what is   coming for us in the age of the resurrection. Last week we   affirmed with Romans 6:5, "If we have been united with Christ in a   death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a   resurrection like his." Today I want us to see some of what that   will involve for us and for the creation.        And I hope you repudiate with me the notion that pondering the   greatness of the age to come makes a person less useful for this   age. I think exactly the opposite is the case. The person who   knows that his destiny is glorious and certain will be free to   live the most radical life of love and sacrifice here on   earth.        If somebody falls out of an airplane with no parachute on and   you don't have one either, you aren't going to jump out after   them. It won't do any good. Two deaths aren't better than one. But   if you have a parachute on, you just might try one of those   awesome rescue attempts, and free fall like a bullet to catch the   helpless and pull your cord. It's the hope of safety in the end   that releases radical, sacrificial love now.        Paul said in Colossians 1:4-5, "We have heard of the love you   have for all the saints because of the hope laid up for you in   heaven." It's the assurance of the hope of heaven that releases   the radical, risk-taking love that makes people look at your life   (like Peter says) and "ask a reason for the hope that is in you"   (1 Peter 3:15). What do those people see when they ask that? They   see you jumping out of an airplane to save another person. So they   say, "Hey how can you jump out of the comfort and safety of this   airplane?" And you answer, "I have a parachute called the hope of   glory."        That's what I want us to think about this morning. What will it   be like.        The invincible purpose of God for creation and for his people   will not be complete until all things are made new and the glory   of the Lord fills them all. In verse 5 God says, "Behold, I make   all things new." And he enforces the certainty of it in two ways.   He is sitting on his throne when he says it--the throne of the   universe. "He who sat upon the throne said, 'Behold I make all   things new.'" And after he had said it he added, "Write this, for   these words are trustworthy and true." So God wants us to read   this and be sure of it. He wants us to have assurance that no   matter how much evil and suffering and futility we see now, he   will make all things new.        Let's look at four ways the newness is coming.         1. God is going to make us spiritually and morally new   and glorious.          The greatest frustration of this age is that we still sin. I   believe Romans 7 describes this painful truth. For example verses   23-24: "I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see   in my members another law at war with the law of my mind." This   war is the most frustrating thing about life in this age--at least   it is for the children of God. We want to be holy and we fall   short of the holiness we long for. We want to love and we say   hurtful things. We want to worship and we feel cold. We want to   walk in peace and we feel anxiety. We want to be pure in thought   and impurity bombards our minds.        There is some progress as the Spirit helps us in our weakness.   But what we long for is deliverance from this bent to sinning.        That is what God promises when he makes all things new. We will   be made spiritually and morally new--not just partially as now,   but wholly. Look at verse 2: "And I saw the Holy City, new   Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned   for her husband."        This is a picture of the church prepared and beautified for her   husband, Jesus Christ. When God makes all things new he makes the   church--the people of God--spiritually and morally beautiful for   his Son. Look at the way this is described in verses 9-11:         9 Then came one of the seven angels who had the      seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me,      saying, "Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the      Lamb." 10 And in the Spirit he carried me away to a great, high      mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out      of heaven from God (the same image as in verse 2), 11 having      the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a      jasper, clear as crystal.          When God makes the bride ready for the Son the way he does it   is by giving us his glory--verse 11: "having the glory of God."   And this glory will purify us so deeply and so thoroughly that we   will be like a rare jewel clear as crystal. Don't you long for the   day when you will be so good and so right and so pure that you   will be like a translucent jewel that people will look at and see   straight through without seeing any impurity at all. Nothing   hidden and nothing shameful.        That's the first way the newness is coming. God will make us   spiritually and morally beautiful for our final marriage with his   Son.         2. Second, God is going to make us physically and   bodily new and glorious.         The Bible does not teach that the final state of glory is one   of disembodied spirits. Plato and his kin wanted it that way   because they thought the body was a drag on the freedom of the   spirit. But the Bible teaches a very different destiny for God's   people. God will make all things new--including our bodies.        Verse 4 points in this direction: "He will wipe away every tear   from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there   be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things   have passed away."        No more death. No more pain. No more tears. What that means is   that the body we know now will be changed. Because it dies. And it   hurts. And it cries. If death is gone and pain is gone and tears   are gone, then the body as we know it here is gone. That may sound   like Plato--good riddance to the body of pain. Revelation is plain   that the point is not good riddance to the body but that God will   make all things new.        Paul put it like this in Philippians 3:20-21,         Our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we      await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will change the body      of our lowliness to be like the body of his glory, according to      the working by which he is able to subdue all things to      himself.         That's what he meant last week in Romans 6: "We shall certainly   be united to him in a resurrection like his." It is a new body: it   will never die again, it will never hurt again, it will never cry   again--except perhaps for joy.        There are a lot of people who feel that they didn't get a fair   shake when the bodies were passed out. Some people have dramatic   deformities, some have lost limbs, some are paralyzed, some can't   hear, some can't see, some have extensive skin blemishes, some   have freakish distortions. But God has no intention of leaving   anybody in that condition if they will trust him. He has his   purposes in letting a man be born blind and leaving him blind for   much of his adult life (John 9:1ff). But he has no intention of   leaving anyone with pain and disability who trusts him.        When God makes all things new he makes our bodies new.         3. Third, God is going to make the creation new and   glorious .        This is the point of verse 1: "Then I saw a new heaven and a   new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed   away, and the sea was no more." I don't think this means that God   picks us up and takes us to a new solar system--though he   certainly could if he wanted to. The hope of the prophets seems to   be that this earth and these heavens will be made new. God will   renovate the whole thing--a kind of global re-hab project. And   everything futile and evil and painful will be done away.        Paul put it like this in Romans 8:21, "The creation itself will   be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the liberty of   the glory of the children of God." The newness and the glory of   the church, the children of God, is primary and first. But then   God promises that the glory of his people will demand a glorious   creation to live in. So the fallen creation will obtain the very   freedom from futility and evil and pain that the church is   given.        So when God makes all things new, he makes us new spiritually   and morally, he makes us new physically, and then he makes the   whole creation new so that our environment fits our perfected   spirits and bodies.        That leaves one last work of renewing when God makes all things   new.         4. God will make our relationship with him new and   glorious.         John tells us about this in verse 4: "I heard a loud voice from   the throne saying, 'Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He   will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God   himself will be with them."        It's true that God is with us now. His Spirit dwells in us (1   Corinthians 6:19). Jesus promised never to leave us to the end of   the age (Matthew 28:20). But in 2 Corinthians 5:6-7 Paul said,   "While we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord, here   we walk by faith and not by sight."        So there is a deep and painful sense in which we are "away from   the Lord"--we do not see as we will one day see. "Blessed are the   pure in heart," Jesus said, "for they shall see God." It's a   promise. Something greater is coming for all of us in our relation   with God.        How many times will a little child say what we all feel, "But   daddy, I can't see him." That is a real heart cry that we should   never lose. Revelation 22:4 gives the answer to it: "They shall   see his face and his name shall be on their foreheads."        When God makes all things new he will make us spiritually and   morally as pure as flawless crystal, he will give us a body like   the body of his glory, he will renovate all creation to take all   futility and evil and pain out of it, and finally he himself will   come to us and let us see his face. And so forever and ever we   will live with pure hearts and glorious bodies on a new earth in   the presence and the glory of our heavenly Father.                              1 This material on Baxter was taken from Timothy   Beougher and J.
