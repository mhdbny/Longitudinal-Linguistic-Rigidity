          CAN YOU BEGIN BY THE SPIRIT AND BE   COMPLETED BY THE FLESH?     (Galatians 3:1-5)             
         O foolish Galatians! Who      has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly      portrayed as crucified? Let me ask you only this: Did you      receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with      faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are      you now ending with the flesh? Did you experience so many      things in vain? -- if it really is in vain. Does he who      supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so      by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?                     
          We have learned at least four things from   chapters one and two that we need to keep in mind as we begin the   main body of the letter. 1) There are false teachers in the   Galatian churches preaching what Paul calls a different gospel   (1:6), which is no gospel at all. 2) The opponents of Paul are   discrediting his message by denying Paul's authority as an   apostle. They say he has his gospel and apostleship secondhand and   that the real authorities are the Jerusalem apostles. 3) Paul   establishes by historical reports that his gospel and authority   are not from any mere man, but came by revelation of Jesus Christ,   and not only that, there is a deep unity of theology and faith   between Paul and the Jerusalem apostles in spite of their   independence. 4) The way Paul has defended his authority and his   gospel show the kind of false teaching that is threatening the   churches of Galatia. It appears that a Jewish group of professing   Christians who claim to have James on their side (2:12) are   teaching that it is not enough to trust Christ for righteousness.   If you rely on faith alone you become a "Gentile sinner" and make   Christ the agent of sin (2:17) -- they said. So faith must be   supplemented with "works of the law." Trusting in what Christ did   for you has to be supplemented by what you can do for Christ.   God's work plus your work equals justification. So the Judaizers   required circumcision (2:3), dietary restrictions (2:12,13), and   the keeping of feasts and holy days (4:10), and at least implied   that by these works the Galatians could contribute their part to   the transaction of justification.              As far as Paul is concerned, if you buy into   this mingling of faith and works you nullify the grace of God   (2:21), you step out of sync with the truth of the gospel (2:14)   and you remove the stumbling block of the cross (5:11). As close   as it may sound to the truth, as close as it may seem to be tied   to the apostles, it is another gospel which is no gospel (1:7),   and those who follow it will be accursed and cut off from Christ   (1:8,9).              The importance and relevance of this issue   for us only increases as we turn to Galatians 3:1-5. For here it   becomes crystal clear that the heresy of the Judaizers is not so   much related to how you begin the Christian life but how you live   it and try to bring it to completion. Anyone who says, "Well, I   know that I began the Christian life by faith alone and so the   warnings of Galatians don't apply to me," -- that person has not   understood the book, especially 3:1-5. Like my Dad always used to   say to me when I would out-drive him by fifty yards off the first   tee: "It's not how you drive, it's how you arrive!" And he was   right.              In 3:1-5 Paul does the same thing to the   Galatians that he did to Peter in 2:11,14ff -- he confronts them   head on with their folly and the inconsistency of their behavior.   They have begun to be sucked in by the Judaizers, and Paul shows   them that their action contradicts the work of Christ on the cross   and contradicts the work of the Spirit in their lives. Let's see   how he does it. If you want to know the main point in advance it   is stated in 5:5. Galatians 3:1-5 is a series of rhetorical   questions that don't come right out and state Paul's point. But   5:5 does: "Through the Spirit by faith we wait for the hope of   righteousness." The hope and confidence of every Christian is that   at the end of the world, when he stands before the Judge of the   universe, the verdict he will hear is "righteous." And the point   of this verse is that the only way to hear that verdict is to wait   for it through the Spirit, not the flesh, and by faith not by   works. That's the main point of 3:1-5, indeed, of the whole book.   So let's listen carefully to 3:1-5 and let the Lord teach us how   to live through the Spirit by faith rather than through the flesh   by works. For as Paul says in Romans 8:13, "Those who live   according to the flesh will die."              Twice Paul calls the Galatians foolish.   Verse 1: "O foolish Galatians"; and verse 3: "Are you so foolish?"   The next phrase in verse 1 explains what he means by foolish: "Who   has bewitched you?" He means that they are acting as if someone   cast a spell on them. It's as if they have been hypnotized. They   are irrational, out of touch with reality, mentally drunk.              Let me draw out two minor implications of   these words. First, don't ever forget that it is the people who   don't take Christ into account who are in a dreamworld. The real   fairy tale is not the incarnation, death and resurrection of   Christ, but the fantasy of godlessness. The most seriously   bewitched people are those who don't believe in demons. The most   deluding stupor in the world is caused by the sedative of   secularism. If Christ is real it is not his followers who are   fools.              Second, even though the Galatians are, as it   were, bewitched, irrational, out of touch with reality, Paul still   writes a very reasonable and tightly argued letter to break the   spell. Some people say, "If people are dead in their sins (Eph.   2:1) and blinded by the God of this age (2 Cor. 4:4), there is no   point in reasoning with them. Only the Holy Spirit can open their   eyes." But Paul reasons for six chapters with people so deluded he   calls them bewitched. The reason is that the Holy Spirit does not   work in a vacuum. He uses the word to break the spell of confusion   and unbelief. Don't let the unreasonableness of your acquaintances   stop you from sharing the wealth of the gospel. God may grant them   to repent and come to know the truth and escape from the snare of   the devil (2 Tim. 2:25,26).              The main thing Paul does in 3:1-5 is help   the Galatians see why their actions are so foolish. The two   reasons he gives is that they are contradicting the work of Christ   on the cross and they are contradicting the work of the Spirit in   their lives. Verse 1 says, "O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched   you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as   crucified?" It was incredible to Paul that anyone who had seen   Christ crucified in the gospel could still get caught up in   legalism. The death of Christ for our sin shows how hopelessly   lost we are and how we can't make any contribution to our   salvation. The stumbling block of the cross, the thing that makes   it so offensive, is that it means in ourselves we are helpless   (Rom. 5:6) and can't do anything to enhance our justification or   sanctification. Paul said in Galatians 5:11 "If I preach   circumcision &#133; the stumbling block of the cross has been   removed." If we believe that by being circumcised or doing any   other work of law (tithing, going to church, teaching Sunday   School), we can add to the work of Christ then we are bewitched   and do not understand the gospel.              Not only does the death of Christ for our   sin show how hopelessly lost we are. It shows how utterly   sufficient the atonement is which God made in Christ for our sin.   The death of Christ is the death knell to our pride but also the   dawn of our hope. That it should take the death of the Son of God   to atone for my sin should shut my mouth forever and bring my life   to an end. But that it was no less than the Son of God who loved   me and gave himself for me (2:20) awakens new life of hope and   faith. The cross kills the independent, self-reliant,   insubordinate me, and the cross quickens a new me who lives only   by faith in the all-sufficiency of Christ and never looks to   itself with any expectancy of power or virtue. Therefore, when we   or the Galatians follow the Judaizers and erect the law as a   ladder to heaven on which to demonstrate our contribution of will   or effort, we nullify the grace of God (2:21), we remove the   stumbling block of the cross (5:11) and we show that we are   bewitched and foolish (3:1,3). That, then, is the  first    reason Paul gives for why the action of the Galatians is so   foolish: it contradicts the work of Christ on the cross.              The second reason Paul gives that the   Galatians are foolish is that their action contradicts the work of   the Spirit in their lives. Some of you expressed a special   interest in hearing more about the practical meaning of Galatians   2:20, ("It is not I who live but Christ lives in me and the life I   now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved   me and gave himself for me.") I think 3:2-5 are a commentary on   that verse; only instead of speaking of Christ in us, Paul speaks   of the Spirit. The experience is the same because 4:6 says the   Spirit which God sends is the Spirit of his Son. Christ and the   Spirit are one. Christ comes to us in his Spirit. So keep 2:20 in   view as we look at 3:2-5.              Paul begins to show them how their action   contradicts the work of the Spirit by reminding them how they   received the Spirit at the start of their Christian lives. Verse   2: "Let me ask you only this: did you receive the Spirit by works   of the law or by hearing with faith?" This verse raises three   questions: 1) What is the relationship between becoming a   Christian and receiving the Spirit? 2) What is the evidence that   the Spirit is present in your life? 3) How do you receive the   Spirit?              1) The answer to the first question is that   becoming a Christian  means  receiving the Spirit of Christ.   Paul assumes in this verse that all Christians have received the   Spirit. It's not something that happens later. Romans 8:9 makes   this crystal clear, "Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ   does not belong to him." This is why it is impossible to think of   Christianity merely in terms of a change of beliefs and a change   of status before God. Becoming a Christian always involves the   coming of Christ's Spirit to dwell and work in the believer. As   2:20 said, the old self dies with Christ and in its place the   risen Christ comes to live. As a Christian you are no longer your   own, you have been bought by Christ and possessed by his   Spirit.              2) What is the evidence of the Spirit's   presence in your life? The New Testament teaches three kinds of   evidence, and all of them are mentioned in Galatians. The first is   mentioned in verse 5, "Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and   works miracles among you do so by works of the law or by hearing   with faith?" One evidence that the Galatians could point to was   miracles that God was doing by the Spirit in their midst. I think   this refers to the kinds of miraculous signs Jesus did, because   the language used is so close to the language which describes   Jesus' miracles in Mt. 14:2 and the gift of miracles in 1 Cor.   12:6. In other words, mighty works like healing and exorcisms and   significant altering of circumstances through prayer -- these gave   evidence to the Galatian believers that the Spirit had been poured   into their lives. But Paul is aware that physical miracles in   themselves do not verify the work of God's Spirit, since   (according to 2 Thess 2:9) Satan can produce powerful signs and   wonders.              So it is important that we consider the   second evidence of the Spirit in the Christian life, namely, the   deep  assurance  that God is our Father and we are his   children. Galatians 4:6 says, "And because you are sons God has   sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts crying, 'Abba!   Father!"' When your heart is enabled to cry out sincerely to God   as your loving Father, it is evidence that the Spirit of Sonship   is in you. Paul puts it like this in Romans 8:15,16, "You received   the Spirit of sonship. When we cry, 'Abba! Father!', it is the   Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the   children of God." So the second evidence of the Spirit's presence   is the  assurance  we feel that God is our Father and that we   are heirs with Christ of glory. (See also 1 Cor. 12:3, "No one can   say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit.")              But even assurance can be deceitful. Jesus   tells about people who felt they were his disciples but will be   turned away from heaven because their lives weren't changed (Mt.   7:21-23). So the third evidence of the Spirit's presence should be   added, namely, a genuine impulse of love. Galatians 5:22 says,   "The fruit of the Spirit is love." The bottom line in testing the   Spirit is the test of love. For most of us there is a combination   of these and other evidences (like joy in affliction, 1 Thess.   1:6; and boldness in witness, Acts 4:31) that signify the Spirit's   reality in our lives.              3) Now the third question verse two raises   (and answers) is how we receive the Spirit. "Did you receive the   Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?" Answer: by   hearing with faith. Paul asks them, Remember back to the time I   was preaching there in the synagogues and in the streets? I was   reasoning from the Old Testament Scriptures that Jesus was the   Christ; I was arguing that all people are sinners, that this Jesus   died for sin and rose again, that any who trust him can have   forgiveness and hope &#133; and as you were hearing my message   faith happened. You didn't plan it, you didn't force it. It came   upon you like dawn comes upon a darkened city, and with it --   whether in front or behind you could not tell -- came the Spirit.   And you felt yourself crying out in your heart, "Abba! Father!"   (Gal. 4:6), and, "Jesus is Lord!" (1 Cor. 12:3). You did no works.   You were worked upon. The Word of God, "sharper than any two-edged   sword" (Heb. 4:12), cut away all your defences and laid bare your   need and God's provision. "The light of the gospel of the glory of   Christ" drove out the darkness of unbelief. You found yourself as   helpless as a little child, yet utterly secure in the love of   Jesus. He had come to you in his Word; the word had produced   faith; the old self of rebellion died; and the Spirit of Christ   took up residence in your heart. Galatians, you did not get the   Spirit, you did not become Christians, by working for God. You   received the Spirit when God worked for you. As James 1:18 says,   "Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth."              So verse two is the first step in showing   the Galatians why their actions contradict the work of the Spirit   in their lives. Paul reminded them how they  began  the   Christian life. Then, as step two, Paul tells them in verse 3, you   have to  keep going  the same way you began. "Are you   foolish? Having begun in the Spirit are you now ending (or being   completed) in the flesh?" The clear implication is, it can't be   done. If you try it you will make shipwreck of the Christian life   (Rom. 8:13). So we need to be very clear about what the Galatians   were about to do here so we can avoid it like the plague.              Notice the change in terminology between   verse 2 and verse 3. In verse two the contrast is between    works  of law and hearing of  faith . In verse 3 the   contrast is between beginning by the  Spirit  and trying to   be completed by the  flesh . We've talked about the Spirit.   But now, what is this "flesh"? It is not physical. It's the old   "I" which cherishes independence and self-assertion. Romans 8:7   says, "The mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it   does not submit to God's law, indeed, it cannot." Flesh is the   autonomous self, so in love with its personal power of   self-determination that it does not and cannot submit to God's   absolute authority. But don't think the flesh always looks wicked.   In its  irreligious  form the flesh always flaunts its   insubordination to God in immorality, idolatry, envy, drunkenness,   and the like, as Paul says in Galatians 5:19 where he describes   the works of the flesh. But in its  religious  form the   subtlety of insubordination and self-determination can manifest   itself in a philosophy of Christian growth which encourages people   who begin with faith to grow by works.              Consider verse 3 very carefully. It is not   directed to those who are yet to start the Christian life. It is   written for us who began some time ago and are now in grave danger   of trying to live the Christian life in a way that nullifies grace   and leads to destruction. The point of the verse is that you must   go on in the Christian life the same way you started it. Since we   began by the work of the Spirit, we must go on relying on the   Spirit. The essence of the Galatian heresy is the teaching that   you begin the Christian life by faith and then you grow in the   Christian life by works, that is, by drawing on powers in yourself   to make your contribution to salvation. One modern form of the   heresy is: "God helps those who help themselves." If you buy into   that as a way of advancing in the Christian life you have put   works where faith belongs. Faith is the only response to God's   word which makes room for the  Spirit  to work in us and   through us. Flesh, on the other hand, is the insubordinate,   self-determining ego which in religious people responds to God's   word not with reliance on the Spirit but with reliance on self. It   can produce a very rigorous morality, but it nullifies grace and   removes the stumbling block of the cross.              I hope you can see that the essential mark   of a Christian is not how far you have progressed in   sanctification, but  on what you are relying to get there .   Are you striving for sanctification by works? Or are you striving   for sanctification by faith? (Note well the issue in verse 3 is   how to be completed, i.e., sanctification.) Are you advancing in   the life of love by the power of the Spirit? Or are you trying to   love in the power of the flesh, that is, by your own works?              Let me close by describing very practically   how I try to live the Christian life so that I can say it is "not   I but Christ"; it is not by the flesh but by the Spirit. I use an   acronym: APTAT. I begin my day with it and I follow it when I must   exert some effort to do right. The goal is for this way of   thinking and feeling to become so much a part of me that I   approach all of life this way.             
                "A" -                I  acknowledge  that apart from      Christ I can do nothing of eternal value (John 15:5). I       acknowledge  with Paul in Romans 7:18, "In me, that is,      in my flesh, dwells no good thing." I  acknowledge  that      the old "I" which loved to deny this fact was crucified with      Christ.                     
                "P" -                I  pray . I  pray  with Paul      in 1 Thess. 3:12 that Christ would make me abound in love. I       pray  that grace might reign in my life through      righteousness (Rom. 5:21). I  pray  that God would produce      in me the obedience he demands (Heb. 13:21; 2 Thess. 1:11).                     
                "T" -                I  trust . This is the key because      Gal. 3:5 says, "Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and      works miracles among you do so by works of the law or by      hearing with faith?" In other words, the ongoing work of the      Spirit to enable us to love as we ought happens only as we      trust the promises of God (Gal. 5:6). So by faith I lay hold on      a promise like Isaiah 41:10: "Fear not, for I am with you, be      not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will      help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand." I       trust  that as I act it will not be I but the power of      Christ in me and me only clinging to him in faith.                     
                "A" -                I  act  in obedience to God's word.      But, O, what a world of difference now between such an act and      what Paul calls works of law. The acknowledgment that I am      helpless, the prayer for divine enablement, the trust that      Christ himself is my help and strength--these transform the act      so that it is a fruit of the Spirit not a work of the      flesh.                     
                "T" -                Finally, when the deed is done and the      day is over I  thank  God for whatever good may have come      of my life (Col. 1:3-5). I thank him for conquering at least in      some measure my selfishness and pride. I give him the glory (1      Pet. 4:11).                     
              APTAT: A -  Acknowledge  your inability   to do good on your own. P -  Pray  for divine enablement. T -    Trust  the promises of God for help and strength and   guidance. A -  Act  in obedience to God's word. T -    Thank  God for whatever good comes. If you feel that this   makes too little of you and too much of God, then I urge you to   check your testimony against that of Paul who said in 1 Cor.   15:10, "I worked harder than any of them, though it was  not   I  but the  grace of God  which was with me." And in   Romans 15:18, "I will not venture to speak of anything except what    Christ  has wrought through me." So we are back to the main   point of 3:1-5 stated in 5:5. Through the  Spirit  (not the   flesh) by  faith  (not works) we wait for the hope of   righteousness. Only when that is true can we say, "I am sure that   the one who began a good work in me,  he  (and he alone!)   will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ" (Phil.   1:6).
