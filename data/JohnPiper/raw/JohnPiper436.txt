    March 26, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     The Depth of Christ&#146;s Love: Its Cost   (Ephesians 4:32-5:2)          And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other    just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Therefore beimitators of God, as beloved    children; and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, andgave Himself up for us, an    offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.               Review      If love for one another is going toflourish and grow in our  church, we must be rooted more deeply in love. That was the pointof last week&#146;s  message. In other words becoming a loving person means living withthe roots of your life  sunk deep in the love of Christ for you. Being loved by Christ isthe ground of becoming  loving. And the root that you send into that ground is the faiththat you are loved.    There&#146;s a phrase in 1 John 4:16 thatdescribes this root:           We have come to know and have believedthe  love which God has  for    us.        We have come to know, and have&#145; believed  the love  which God has for us. The love that God has for us is the groundof our becoming loving  people. And the root that we send down into that ground, to benourished by it, is faith  -- we have  believed  the love that God has forus. Believing the depth  of God&#146;s love for me is the key to my growing into a lovingperson.    And the key to believing the love that God hasfor us is  seeing it  revealed in the word of Scripture . A few people were allowedto see Jesus in the flesh  and touch him and watch him teach and heal and suffer and die andrise. We might feel  jealous that our faith in the love of Christ can&#146;t be basedon that kind of first  hand sight and touch. But that was not God&#146;s plan. When Jesusprayed for his  disciples in John 17:20, he said, [Father], I do not ask inbehalf of these alone,  but for those also who believe in Me  through theirword . It was the plan of  God that we come to faith, not by seeing the love of Christ in theflesh, but by  seeing  the love of Christ in the word  of those who knew him.      The focus of the next four weeks: thedepth of Christ&#146;s love  for us      Because of all that, here&#146;s theplan for the next four  weeks. I hope this will help you prepare yourself in prayer andmeditation for what&#146;s  coming. And I hope it will help you know when God is moving you toinvite others to attend  with you. My aim in this series is that our love for one anotherand for those outside  would grow and deepen. But this will happen only as we are rooted -- that is, as we  believe -- more and more deeply in the love of Christ for us. Andthat belief comes by  seeing the depth of Christ&#146;s love for us revealed in hisWord. So for four weeks  climaxing on Easter Sunday I want to direct our attention to thedepth of Christ&#146;s  love for us.    As I have pondered the love of Christ for us,and the different ways  that the Bible presents it to us, I have seen  four waysthat the depth of  Christ&#146;s love is revealed. We will spend a week on each ofthese.      First, we know the depth of someone&#146;s lovefor us by  what it  costs  him: if he sacrifices his life for us, it assures us ofdeeper love than if he  only sacrifices a few bruises. So we will see the depth ofChrist&#146;s love by the  greatness of what it cost him.    Second, we know the depth of someone&#146;slove for us by  how  little we deserve it . If we have treated him well all ourlife, and have done all that  he expects of us, then when he loves us, it will not prove as muchlove as it would if he  loved us when we had offended him, and shunned him, and disdainedhim. The more  undeserving we are, the more amazing and deep is his love for us.So we will see the depth  of Christ&#146;s love in relation to how undeserving are theobjects of his love (Romans  5:5-8).    Third, we know the depth of someone&#146;s lovefor us by  the  greatness of the benefits we receive  in being loved. If we arehelped to pass an exam,  we will feel loved in one way. If we are helped to get a job, wewill feel love another  way. If we are helped to escape from an oppressive captivity andgiven freedom for the  rest of our life, we will feel loved another way. And if we arerescued from eternal  torment and given a place in the presence of God with fullness ofjoy and pleasures for  evermore, we will know a depth of love that surpasses all others(1 John 3:1-3).So we will  see the depth of Christ&#146;s love by the greatness of thebenefits we receive in being  loved by him.    Fourth, we know the depth of someone&#146;slove for us  by the  freedom with which they love us . If a person does good thingsfor us because someone  is making him, when he doesn&#146;t really want to, then wedon&#146;t think the love is  very deep.  Love is deep in proportion to its liberty . So ifan insurance company  pays you $40,000 because you lose your spouse, you don&#146;tusually marvel at how much  this company loves you. There were legal constraints. But if yourSunday School class  makes all your meals for a month after your spouse dies, andsomeone calls you every day,  and visits you every week, then you call it love, because theydon&#146;t have to do this.  It is free and willing. So we will see the depth of Christ&#146;slove for us in his  freedom: No one takes my life from me; I lay it down of myown accord (John  10:18).    That&#146;s what I see in the New Testament.There are specific texts  that stress each of those four ways of seeing the depth ofChrist&#146;s love for us.  We&#146;ll take one a week. And if you pray earnestly, and theFasting Forty seek the  Lord, then perhaps God will answer the prayer of Ephesians 3:17-18, that we would be  rooted and grounded in Christ&#146;s love and have power tocomprehend the height and  depth and length and breadth of his love -- and so become like himin his love.      The depth of Christ&#146;s love revealedin it&#146;s costliness      Today I want us to see the depth ofChrist&#146;s love revealed  in its costliness. Let&#146;s look at Ephesians 5:1-2,           Therefore be imitators of God, as belovedchildren; and walk in    love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us,an offering and a    sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.        Be sure to see four plain and wonderful thingshere. First, be sure you  see that Paul is showing us the depth of Christ&#146;s love foryou. Verse 2: Christ  loved you, and gave himself. The giving of himself is thedemonstration of his  love .  Second, notice that the cost of his love was  himself  -- hislife. It was not just  money or time or energy or inconvenience or even suffering; it wasthe full extent of  sacrifice. He gave himself. Third, notice that this love and thisself-giving was for  you .  Christ loved  you,  and gave himself. Paul is talkingabout believers (Eph.  2:8). He gave himself for  you . Finally, notice that God theFather was pleased with  this act of self-sacrificing love. Verse 2: Christ alsoloved you, and   gave  Himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God as afragrant aroma .  When God bowed down over the love that his Son poured out for uson the cross, it was a  fragrant aroma to him. God loves the Son&#146;s love of us.      An illustration of costly love      Sometimes we are so familiar withspectacular it doesn&#146;t  move us as it should. We have to look at something lesser, beamazed, and then look back  to really feel the wonder of the original. Chuck Colson told thestory of a group of  American prisoners of war during the second World War, who weremade to do hard labor in a  prison camp. Each had a shovel and would dig all day, then come inand give an account of  his tool in the evening. One evening twenty prisoners were linedup by the guard and the  shovels were counted. The guard counted nineteen shovels andturned in rage on the twenty  prisoners demanding to know which one did not bring his shovelback. No one responded. The  guard took out his gun and said that he would shoot five men ifthe guilty prisoner did  not step forward. After a moment of tense silence, a nineteen-year-old soldier -- the age  of my Ben -- stepped forward with his head bowed down. The guardgrabbed him, took him to  the side and shot him in the head, and turned to warn the othersthat they better be more  careful than he was. When he left the men counted the shovels andthere were twenty. The  guard had miscounted. And the boy had given his life for hisfriends.    Can you imagine the emotions that must havefilled their hearts as they  knelt down over his body? In the five or ten seconds of silencethe boy had weighed his  whole future in the balance -- a future wife, an education, a newtruck, children, a  career, fishing with his dad -- and he chose death so that othersmight live. Jesus said  in John 15:13, Greater love has no one than this, thatone lay down his life  for his friends. To love is to choose suffering for the sakeof another.       An infinitely more costly love      Jesus has loved you this way. Only, Oso much more! Consider  the life he laid down. One of the reasons that story hits us sohard is because the boy  was nineteen years old. If he had been 89 years old and the othersnineteen, we might say  it was a beautiful act of love, but with a full life behind him itwould not feel like the  same kind of sacrifice as when your whole life stretches in frontof you. So consider the  life that Jesus sacrificed for you.      First  of all, he was young too. He wasabout 33 years old. His  ministry was three years old. He was cut off, as we say, beforehis prime.      Second , he was the oldest son of awidowed mother. One of the  last acts of his life was to see that she be taken care of.           When Jesus saw His mother, and thedisciple whom He loved standing    nearby, He said to His mother, Woman, behold, yourson! Then He said to the    disciple, Behold, your mother!
 (John 19:26-27)        The life he was giving up for you was youngand, from a human  standpoint, it was a life needed by his mother.      Third , he was the most kind and caringand wise and courageous  man who ever lived. Peter testified, He committed no sin,nor was any deceit found  in his mouth (1 Pet. 2:22). Even his enemies knew they couldfind no fault in him  (Matt. 22:16) I find no guilt in him, Pilate said(John 19:6). So the life he  gave for us was no ordinary life of human value -- which would begreat enough. It was a  sinless life. A life of perfectly balanced joy and sorrow,tenderness and toughness,  justice and mercy, grief and anger, speech and silence, prayer andaction. This life, of  all the lives that have ever lived, was the most valuable life.The most worthy of living,  the least worthy of dying. This is the life he gave for you --that you might live.     Fourth , he was the Son of God. Whichmeans he was God as well as  man. United to his human nature was a divine nature, in themysterious unity of one  person. The dignity and worth of this life was not just relativelysuperior to other human  lives. This life was of infinite value -- not the way other humansare of value, but the  way God is of infinite value, namely, as the basis of all humanvalue. Humans have value  to the degree that we reflect the image of God. But that meansthat if the image has so  much value because of the original, how much more value mustbelong to the original. With  this life Jesus went to the cross for you. This is how much itcost to cover our sins  against the holiness of God. And he paid it willingly so we couldlive.     Fifth , as the Son of God Jesus wassupremely loved by his Father  in heaven. This is My  loved  Son, the Fathersaid, with whom I am  well-pleased; listen to Him! (Matt. 17:5). Suppose thatnineteen-year-old prisoner  of war was the son of the President of the United States -- and heknew that there were  powers available to him to escape not only the death he died butalso the prison camp --  and suppose that you find out that his father, the President, notonly had a massive love  for the boy, but also approved of his dying for you, and wanted tomeet those of you for  whom he died, and give you some of the boy&#146;s inheritance.Would not the worth of that  life be so unspeakably precious as to make you feel absolutelyoverwhelmed with love?    And consider now not only the life that Jesussacrificed for us, but  consider also what the sacrifice involved. To get to the pointwhere he could die, Jesus  had to plan for it. He left the glory of heaven and took on humannature so that he could  hunger and get weary and in the end suffer and die. Theincarnation was the preparation of  nerve endings for the nails of the cross. Jesus needed a broadhuman back for a place to  be scourged. He needed a brow and skull as a place for the thorns.He needed cheeks for  Judas&#146; kiss and soldiers&#146; spit. He needed hands and feetfor spikes. He needed a  side as a place for the sword to pierce. And he needed a brain anda spinal cord, with no  vinegar and no gall, so that he could feel the entire excruciatingdeath -- for you.     The nineteen-year-old boy was a wonderfulpicture of love. But compared  to Jesus he was only a picture. His death was quick and relativelypainless. Jesus&#146;  death was one of the worst kinds of torture devised for humanpain. So when Ephesians 5:2  says, Christ loved you and gave himself up for us,don&#146;t breeze over the  words: gave himself up. His love is great inproportion to the costliness of  his sacrifice. And his sacrifice was horrendous.    We should ask in closing, how personally shouldwe take this  demonstration of love? Should you feel personally loved this waythis morning and later on  today and tomorrow morning? Or should it remain a kind of general,great, historic wonder  that you look at from a distance with admiration -- like thedepths of the Grand Canyon?  The answer is given by the testimony of the same writer, Paul, inGalatians 2:20b,           The life which I now live in the flesh Ilive by faith in the Son    of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself up for me.        This is what the apostle and the Lord himselfis calling you to this  morning. To see the depths of the love of Christ for you. Tobelieve the love that he has  for you. And to send the roots of your life down, down, down intothis bottomless love.  And say with Paul,           The life which I now live in the flesh Ilive by faith in the Son    of God,  who loved me   [me,personally],   and gave himself    for me .
