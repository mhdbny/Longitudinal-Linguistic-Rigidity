      September 24, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church:   Volume 1    Paul&#146;s Ambition and Bethlehem&#146;sMission   Introducing the Master Planning Team Document   (Romans 15:18-21)           For I will not presume to speak ofanything except what Christ has    accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of theGentiles by word and deed, in    the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; sothat from Jerusalem and    round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospelof Christ. And thus I    aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already  named, that I    might not build upon another man&#146;s foundation; but as it iswritten, They who    had no news of Him shall see, and they who have not heard shallunderstand.              Introduction: Are Mission Statements Biblical?     I would like to begin this morning byputting the very concept of  mission statements in a Biblical framework. Are we doing aBiblical and God-honoring thing  by spending eight months laboring over a mission and visionstatement? Consider first  Romans 15:18-21. Paul talks about his ministry -- his mission, orvision of God&#146;s  call on his life.          I will not presume to speak of anythingexcept what Christ has    accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of theGentiles by word and deed.        So notice how Paul stresses that his ministryis what Christ has worked  through him. It is not some self-started, self-designed, self-sustained mission. It is the  very work of Christ, continued through Paul. He continues in thisvain in verse 19:          . . . in the power of signs and wonders,in the power of the    Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far asIllyricum I have fully preached    the gospel of Christ.         So he continues to emphasize that his missionis not in his own power.  It is God who works signs and wonders; it&#146;s the Holy Spiritwho gave him the power to  preach the gospel fruitfully from Jerusalem to Bosnia.    But now look what he says about the role of hisown mind -- his own  planning and intentionality in this God-designed, Spirit-sustainedmission. Verses 20-21:          And thus I aspired  (literally:it was my ambition)     to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already  named, that I might    not build upon another man's foundation; 21 but as it iswritten, THEY WHO HAD NO    NEWS OF HIM SHALL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALLUNDERSTAND.        Notice two things. One is that Paul had a clearaim in view as he  carried out his mission. He did not get up every morning and say,Jesus I have no  idea what my mission is today; please tell me. He had anambition -- a mission  statement -- to preach the gospel, not where Christ wasalready named. That  was his goal. It guided his strategy and shaped the meaning of hislife. It was his  passion to make Christ known among peoples who had never heard thegospel.    Secondly, notice that he built this personalmission on Scripture.  Verse 21 is a quote from Isaiah 52:15.           As it is written, &#145;They who had nonews of him shall see, and    they who have not heard shall understand.&#146;        So Paul took a passage of scripture writtenabout the Messiah and the  ministry of Christ, and found in it a God-ordained application tohis own situation and  built his personal mission on it.    Not everybody was called to do what Paul didwith this scripture.  Timothy was called to stay and minister in Ephesus. Titus wascalled to stay in Crete. But  Paul had a focus and a call and a mission and he could state it:I make it my  ambition to preach the gospel not where Christ has already beennamed.    From this and other examples in the Bible Iconclude that praying about  and thinking about and writing mission statements is a Biblicalthing to do. The work  should be rooted in scripture and should be done in such relianceon the Holy Spirit that  we can say, I will not speak of anything except what Christhas wrought through  me.     Review of the Master Planning Process     This is what I believe the BethlehemBaptist Church Master Planning  Team wants to say, and can say: Christ has been at work inour labor. Since  last October about 20 of us met every other week or so and prayed.We studied who you are  what you think and what God may be saying to this congregationthrough the responses of  its members; and we analyzed the people of our geographic area. Wesought the scriptures  together. We looked at our history. We looked at our weakness andour strengths. We looked  at our staff and programs. We put a finger on what we believed tobe the pulse of God and  on the pulse of the congregation and on the pulse of our ownhearts; and where the rhythm  beat together we felt we were getting close to discerningGod&#146;s special word to us.  We talked and argued and discussed and drafted and talked anddiscussed and redrafted and  talked and redrafted -- until a remarkable affirmation emerged inthe group, more unified  than some expected.     What you have in your hand is the fruit of thatalmost year-long  process. And our prayer now is first for church-wideunderstanding. We are not looking for  a hasty approval or unthinking affirmation. We are looking forpatient, honest, prayerful,  biblical reflection and understanding. To that end I will preachmessages related to this  mission-vision document throughout the fall. Our prayer is that --in the same way that we  came to embrace this vision with joy and zeal, God would work inour church an amazing  unity around the spirit and content of this vision. Besidessermons, I hope also to  produce a study guide for your use at home. This week&#146;s is onthe table outside the  sanctuary. You can use it for your daily devotional or as asupplement. Maybe you&#146;ve  never done something like this as a family. Why not try it eachday this week, and really  be up to speed next Sunday.    This is a congregational church. Under Christthe Head the congregation  has final say over Elders and staff. Elders have been commissionedby the congregation  constitutionally to lead the church. The elders assembled a MasterPlanning Team to help  them on behalf of the people. That group offered the Elders thisdocument and the Elders  have heartily affirmed it. It represents where the staff andelders and Master Planning  Team believe God is calling us to go. We cannot force or guaranteeyour following us. We  are certainly not infallible. This is not the Bible. We believe itis a faithful  application of the Bible to this moment in Bethlehem&#146;shistory. If this is of God, we  believe he will do among the vast majority of us what he did forthe 30 some leaders that  were involved in the crafting of this statement. May God do it forhis glory.     Bethlehem Baptist Church&#146;sMission/Vision Statement     This morning I want to introduce you to it -- and somehow try to  restrain myself from getting too excited about it so that Idon&#146;t say more than there  is time to say. Pray.    Take it in your hands. And have it with youevery week. It is a very  unusual document. It breaks the rules. It is too long; it istheological; it is carefully  worded (it has footnotes!); it is passionate; it is, in short,Bethlehem. It identifies us  not merely in what it says, but in what it is -- the very way itis conceived and  completed speaks volumes about the identity of this church. Andthat is what the document  is for. It should help us know who we are and where are we aregoing. What makes us tick?  What is our passion? What do we value. What are the big goals?What is the preferred  atmosphere and ethos?    It is not a list of particular plans. It is nota blueprint. It is a  conceptual design to guide the plans and to shape the blueprint.Seventeen new planning  teams have been formed. They have been given this document andhave been charged by the  elders; give yourselves to prayer and thought about how thisvision can become reality in  your area. Bring us plans in the next three months that we, theElders, can weave together  and commend to the people early next year. So we have moved fromthe analysis of the Word  and the Congregation and the community and the world, to thevision (which you have in  your hand). Now we will move on to the planning, which is underwaynow for the next  several months, and then to the phase of resources and engagementand commitment sometime  next spring. And then a process of refining and growing and livingand ministering and  loving as long as God gives us grace.    First let&#146;s get a quick overview. Thedocument has five parts.           Page one (front cover) is  OurMission .             Page two (inside the cover) is The Spiritual Dynamic       that drives our mission.             Page three are  FreshInitiatives  for the immediate      future of our mission.             Pages four, five and six are  TheValues  that manifest      our mission.             On Page seven there is  AReaffirmed Vision  to focus our      mission.            That&#146;s the structure. Now let&#146;s goback and let me say  something about each one so you can begin to catch on to what itall means and how it  works together.     Our Mission     First, Our Mission as a church -- Our Mission is:           To spread a passion for thesupremacy of God in all things for    the joy of all peoples.             This is what I will preach on next week. Thisis what the daily study  guide relates to this week. This is the way we were led to expressour ultimate reason for  being. If you wonder why we chose this and where it came from theanswer is very simple:  this is God&#146;s mission statement. And I asked him if we coulduse it. God exists  to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all thingsof the joy of all  peoples. This is the one part of the whole document that wehope every member of  Bethlehem will know by heart. Eighteen words. Eighteen incendiarywords. (Sorry Barnabas,  that&#146;s a big word: it means, explosive, easy to set on fire,ready to burst into a  flame of light and heat and power.)     If you don&#146;t have a mission statement foryour life, dream about  living for this great purpose. There is nothing greater. Who canmeasure the power of a  singular, biblical, prayed-over life purpose. Come back nextSunday and ponder with me if  God may be calling all of us to shape our common life around thisultimate purpose.     The Spiritual Dynamic     Second, page two,  The SpiritualDynamic  that drives  our mission.           We join God the Father in magnifying thesupremacy of his glory    through our Lord Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy Spiritby treasuring all that God    is, Loving all whom he loves, praying for all his purposes,meditating on all his Word,    sustained by all his grace.        Now what is this, and why is it here? This iswhat I would call  basic Christianity. It&#146;s the method or the meansor the strategy of  living the Christian life. It&#146;s what you explain to somebodywhen they ask,  What does it mean to you folks at Bethlehem, to be aChristian? How do you go about  being just a basic Christian. You live to magnify Godthrough his Son Jesus and by  the power of his Spirit; and the way you do that is by trusting ortreasuring him and  loving people and praying and reading the Bible and dependingentirely on free and  sovereign grace.     This is the sort of thing that some say shouldbe left out of a vision  statement -- you take it for granted. But we couldn&#146;t. BasicChristianity (faith,  love, prayer, the word grace, Jesus, the Holy Spirit) is tenthousand times more important  that our little tactical adjustments in how to do church in thisgeneration. This page  will be here like a rock underneath our feet when everythingfollowing in this booklet is  changed. To leave out the spiritual dynamic, would be like awedding ceremony without  vows. I hope to preach four messages on this page.     Fresh Initiatives     Third, page three, the  FreshInitiatives  for the  immediate future of our mission. Now at this point there isa shift in the document.  Up till now the Mission and Spiritual Dynamic express great old,cherished unwavering  truths that have carried us for a long time. They are in a sensethe non-negotiables of  Biblical Christianity.     But with page three come not the old, and notmerely the new, but  the  new application of the old . When we put our finger on yourpulse last fall, and put it  on the heart of God his Word and in prayer, and then put it on ourown heart and listened,  this page is what we felt. In a very remarkable sense we werecaptured by these because  God was already doing them among in fresh ways. It was likegetting on a moving train. God  has not waited for us to figure everything out. He is moving atBethlehem with some new  strengths and some adjusted trajectories, and some fresh emphasesand a different spirit.  I read it with you.         Our  mission  and  Spiritual Dynamic declare that the    all-satisfying supremacy of God shines most brightly throughsacrificial deeds of joyful  love .    The cry of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of our people is for afresh, decisive emphasis    on  relationships of   Love .        Therefore we eagerly embraceGod&#146;s call for new, visible    manifestations of love toward each other, our guests and ourneighbors. With a fresh    openness and outgoing spirit to each other and to all newpeople, we henceforth put    understanding above accusation, forbearance above faultfinding,and Biblical unity above    the demand for uniformity.         The value of relationships.   Wewill take new practical    steps to develop an atmosphere where personal, deepening,supportive, faith-building    relationships of love are highly valued as expressions of ourpassion for the supremacy of    God&#146;s love.        Urban-Suburban Partnership.   Wewill strive to forge a    mutually enriching urban-suburban partnership, in which asignificant range of racially,    educationally, and economically diverse people feel at home, asthey grow in their passion    for the supremacy of God.        Interracial reconciliation.  Against the rising spirit of    indifference, alienation and hostility in our land, we willembrace the supremacy of    God&#146;s love to take new steps personally and corporatelytoward racial reconciliation,    expressed visibly in our community and in our church.        Diversity in God-centered worship.  Sunday morning worship    is a corporate expression of our passion for the supremacy ofGod. We sense God&#146;s    leading to develop fresh expressions of this passion that 1)allow for a more focused and    free lingering of love in the presence of the Lord; 2) reflectmusically the diversity of    our congregation and our metropolitan culture; and 3) interweavethe values of intense    God-centeredness and more personal ministry to each other in thepower of the Holy Spirit.        Good news to the poor.   We willdevelop new strategies for    proclaiming the all-satisfying supremacy of God&#146;s love andjustice to the poor    through 1) personal involvement; 2) a more welcoming atmosphere;3) local missionary    strategies of urban disciple making; and 4) equippingmissionaries for unreached urban    peoples.        Challenging Church and culture with thetruth.   We will    challenge our culture and the wider Christian movement in freshways with the Biblical    truth of God&#146;s all-satisfying supremacy, by courageousChristian action and speech in    the secular world.       Even before we put concrete plans in place toflesh out these  initiatives, the challenges are manifestly immense. And thequestion will be: once we have  understood them, will the Spirit of God produce in us a passion togive our lives to these  things? Will he persuade us that this is a vision of a spirituallypowerful and beautiful  church -- and I don&#146;t mean the building? Will we feeltogether -- as many of us  already do -- that the freshness of these six initiatives is thebreath of the Holy Spirit  blowing upon us? That&#146;s the question. Take your time. Andmake sure you read the  right column of initiatives in the spirit of the left column oflove.     Values     I don&#146;t have time to speak about thethree pages of values.  I&#146;ll just say in passing that they have at least fourfunctions. One is that the  fresh  initiatives  grew out of them. When we percolated seventy somevalues in the pot of  prayer, what simmered to the top were the  fresh initiatives. The second function is  to give some guidance and some boundaries to the way we implementthe fresh initiatives.  The implementation of the fresh initiatives must not contradictthe wider expression of  our values. The third function of the values is that they helpgive a bigger picture of  how broad our concerns are as a Christian church. They are whatyou would say if someone  said, Talk to me a few minutes about the kinds of thingsyour church cares  about. Finally, the values keep before us a huge range ofvaluable ministry  possibilities that may at any time become a priority of God sothat it is thrust upon us  as an inescapable emphasis in our ministry. I can&#146;t take thetime to read them now. I  hope you will.     Reaffirmed Vision: 2000 X 2000     Finally, on page seven the Master PlanningTeam and the Elders put  forward a  Reaffirmed Vision  to focus ourMission.          To spread a passion for the supremacyof God in all things for    the joy of all peoples, we gladly embrace with fresh zeal thesending and harvesting goals    of &#145;2000 by 2000.'        Those goals are spelled out in detail on page10. God is calling us, we  believe to send out 2000 of our people into missions by the end ofthe year 2000 (467 have  gone). He is calling us to see 2000 people in this area makeprofessions of faith through  the witness of our people (178).     What an incredible privilege it is to havesingle people and families  being raised up year after year in our church who are respondingto God&#146;s call to  join Paul in his ambition to take the gospel where it isn&#146;t.The numbers here are  daunting, but we want to stretch toward a goal that we cannotreach without God.    2000 by 2000 is a way of saying: We are notplaying games with our  mission statement. Our mission to spread a passion for thesupremacy of God in all things  for the joy of all peoples will be put to the test -- in finances,in people, in prayer.  And the test is called 2000 by 2000.     Not only that, 2000 by 2000 gives a worldthrust to the six  fresh  initiatives . In one sense they are the retooling orrefurbishing of the local  launching pad for 2000 by 2000.     And not only that, 2000 by 2000 will provewhether we value our values  in a narrow and confined way or in a global and expansive way: ifwe value these 72 things  for ourselves, how can we be authentic Christians and not valuethem for others -- for the  lost people in our city, and for the unreached peoples of theearth. 2000 X 2000 is a kind  of litmus test of all the rest of this document: do we mean it oris God in it?    I close this first glimpse at the visiondocument with a personal  testimony. I love what this document says. I would gladly stand inthe halls of congress  and say, it is the immense and joyful privilege of my life toserve a church -- a people  -- whose mission is  to spread a passion for the supremacyof God in all things  for the joy of all peoples.  I can embrace that as themission of my life. It is  the mission of my life.     And in this process with the Master PlanningTeam for the last year,  God has met me again and again, and blessed me, and taught me andrefreshed me and given  me hope. And I am very eager today to join hands with you in thisfresh vision. I have  maybe 15 years left of pastoral ministry. When I read thisbooklet, and pray over it, and  let it sink in, this vision is what I want to give my life to. Ihope you&#146;ll join me.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
