    March 19, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Who Shall Separate us from the Loveof Christ?   (Romans 8:28-39)          And we know that God causes all things towork together for good to    those who love God, to those who are called according to Hispurpose. For whom He    foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the imageof His Son, that He might    be the first-born among any brethren; and whom He predestined,these He also called; and    whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified,these He also glorified.    What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who isagainst us? He who did    not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how willHe not also with Him    freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge againstGod&#146;s elect? God is the    one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus isHe who died, yes, rather    who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who alsointercedes for us. Who shall    separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, ordistress, or persecution, or    famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it is written,For Thy sake we are    being put to death all day long; we were considered as sheep tobe slaughtered. But    in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him wholoved us. for I am convinced    that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,nor things present, nor    things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any othercreated thing, shall be    able to separate us from the love of God, which is in ChristJesus our Lord.           I begin this morning with two questions. I won&#146;t ask you toraise your hand. But you  must answer these before God. Speak a quiet answer to God to eachquestion. The reason I  do this is because how you answer these questions determineswhether the rest of this  message is true of you now, or is only an invitation for you tocome to the banquet of  faith.    The questions are based on Romans 8:28. This isone of the greatest  assurances of God&#146;s love in all the Bible. But it has twoqualifications attached to  it. It is not true for everyone. It is true for people describedin this verse: We  know that God causes all things to work together for good 1) tothose who love God, 2) to  those who are called according to His purpose.    So here are my questions:     Question #1 : Do you love God? No oneloves God perfectly in this  life. That is not the question. We all know there can be a realuniting love with a wife  or husband or mother or father or dear friend, without that lovebeing perfect. In fact  the greater and more authentic the love, the more keenly it feelsits own imperfections.  The question is not about perfection. The question is: Is God yourtreasure? Jesus said,  Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also(Luke 12:34). That is,  there will your love be. He was trying to persuade us to have ourtreasure in heaven, not  earth. He was calling us to treasure God above all things. Becausewhat you count as your  treasure is what your heart embraces and loves. So Do youlove God? means  Is he your treasure? Is God the most valuable realityin your life?      Question #2 : Have you been called by Godaccording to his  purpose? This does not mean, Have you ever heard thegospel? Or: Have  you ever heard an invitation calling you to repent andbelieve? Verse 30 makes plain  what the call is we are talking about here: [Those] whom[God] predestined, these He  also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whomHe justified, these He  also glorified. All those who are called are justified. Sothis calling from God is  not a mere invitation, but a powerful and effective summons thatwoke you up from the  slumber of ignorance and rebellion, so that you saw Jesus andgladly submitted to him.       Called By Christ: AnIllustration      Let me put it in a picture. But firstconsider 1 Corinthians 1:23,           We preach Christ crucified, to Jews astumbling block, and to    Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jewsand Greeks, Christ the    power of God and the wisdom of God        Many regard Christ crucified as foolishness.But those who are called  see in him the power and the wisdom of God. Something has happenedto them. They&#146;ve  been called.    Picture it this way: before you were called byGod you were in real  sense asleep in your bed. Into your bedroom came Jesus Christ. Hestood there in the glory  of his Calvary love and his Resurrection power. But you wereasleep. In fact you were  dreaming. And in the dream (which is your ordinary life) you sawJesus. Only in the dream  he looked foolish. He wasn&#146;t attractive. You wondered whyothers made such a big deal  out of him. In the dream your television was more exciting. Yourboyfriend was more real.  Your job more satisfying.    Then God&#146;s Spirit -- the Holy Spirit --came into the bedroom  where Jesus was standing in the glory of his Calvary love andResurrection power. And the  Spirit hovered over your dreaming head and  called , in avoice, just loud enough,   Wake up ! And it shook you. And you opened youreyes. And there before  you stood the real Jesus Christ. And his glory was unmistakable.And you knew that (all  your life) you&#146;d been dreaming -- that all your thoughtsabout his being foolish and  unreal and unattractive were mere fantasies and empty images ofsleeping mind. But now the  veil of slumber was lifted and the light of the gospel ofthe glory of Christ  was irresistibly true. Christ crucified was now for you what itreally is: the power of  God and the wisdom of God. That his what it means to be called.    So I ask, Have you been called byGod? Is Christ, in his  death for sinners, wisdom and power to you? Or are you stillasleep in the fantasy world  of dreams and illusions where Jesus is unimportant, unexciting,unattractive? Can you say  honestly this morning, Christ crucified is true power andChrist crucified is true  wisdom.    Now, if you have honestly answered, Yes, tothese two questions then  the rest of this message is gloriously true for you. And if youcouldn&#146;t answer, Yes,  then this message may be even more relevant, because it is thecoming into your bedroom of  Christ and the drawing near of his Spirit.      The Love of Christ: The Root of OurLove for One Another      The main point I want us to see thismorning is in verse 35.  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Theanswer to that question is:  No one and nothing. My aim this morning is to remind you and toawaken you afresh to the  unshakable love that Christ has for you --you who answered yes tothose two questions. Who  shall separate you from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation  (or any  pressure or trouble),  distress  (or any difficulty orcrisis),  persecution   (or any opposition or ridicule),  famine  (or any sufferingor scarcity),  nakedness   (or any assault or shame),  peril  (or any danger or threat), sword  (or any  injury or violence or death)? Shall any of that separate youfrom the love of  Christ? Paul answers, No, on the contrary, as verse 37 says,But in all these things  we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.    Not only can we not be separated from the lovethat Christ has for us,  but that love is so powerfully for us, at all times, that it turnsevery circumstance into  a triumph. In all these things we overwhelmingly conquerthrough him who loved  us. So my aim this morning is to remind you of this and showit to you, and pray  with you that you will grasp it. And it will grasp you.    The way this truth fits into the overall serieson The Greatest  of These is Love is that again and again in the Bible thelove of God for us is the  root of our love for each other. The reality is that if we do notrest in the love of God  for us we will not be able to love each other. For example, Jesussaid in John 13:34,          A new commandment I give to you, that youlove one another, even as    I have loved you, that you also love one another.        His love for us is first, and ours is an echoof it. John 15:12-13,           This is My commandment, that you love oneanother, just as I have    loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay downhis life for his friends.        His love for us is before and under our lovefor each other. And it is  a deep, deep, unshakable Calvary love.    Ephesians 4:32-5:1,           Be kind to one another, tender-hearted,forgiving each other, just    as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Therefore be imitatorsof God, as beloved    children.        All true love begins with this: God in Christloved us and forgave us.  Then he adopted us so that we are called his children. Then helavished his ongoing love  on us in the family. And now -- and only now, on the basis of allthat -- he says,  Imitate me. Be imitators of God as lovedchildren. And mark this!  Be an imitator of God -- not as a peon admirer in the audience.Not as an insecure little  kid ogling at a ball player&#146;s baggy shorts. Not as abeginning musician listening to  the CD of her favorite, but unknown, maestro. But, as lovedchildren. Be  imitators of God  as loved children . It&#146;s thelove of God in Christ  for  us  that draws out and empowers the our imitating love for eachother. It&#146;s  because we love the way our Father   is   that makes uswant to be that way.    Or again in 1 John 3:16,           We know love by this, that He laid downHis life for us; and we    ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.        I love to talk about radical Christianity --Christianity that lays  down its life for others, and shows how radically secure we are inthe love of God.  But it all begins with him, not us. 1 John 4:10-11,           In this is love, not that we lovedGod  [or each other],     but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation forour sins. Beloved  [read:    loved ones] , if God so loved us, we also oughtto love one another.        So that&#146;s the reason for today&#146;sfocus: If God so loved us,  we ought to love each other. And so we need to see that God did solove us -- and does so  love us. Because, unless I am badly mistaken, there is an immenselonging in this  congregation to discover new depths of love to each other and tovisitors and to our most  difficult to love associates. Would not the tears come to our eyesto read more letters  like this one to me from February 26 from a pastor in Iowa:         Two weeks ago while on vacation I returned toBethlehem. I was full of    joy because of the power and presence of the Holy Spirit. It wasmanifested in ways that I    have never sensed before at Bethlehem. Since about 1988 andevery year thereafter    I&#146;ve worshipped with you and sat under your ministry. Whileyour preaching has always    fed my soul, the congregation seemed unfriendly; we were nevergreeted or made welcome in    all the times we visited and a chill surrounded the worshipservice.       But two Sunday&#146;s ago it was different.Both my wife and [I] had    people come and welcome us. A fellow by the name of John Fastspent a great deal of time    visiting with me and thanked me for coming . The worship serviceand worship team were    God-glorifying with little focus upon man .       I can only imagine the darkness you&#146;veexperienced this past year,    yet I see God doing an even greater work through you and thechurch. I heard it in the    preaching of the Word. I experienced in the God-centeredworship. I enjoyed it in the    radiance and warmth of the congregation. The providence of Godhas ordained a time of    darkness for the sake of purification. The greater glory of Godis now being revealed.       I receive that with a deep sense of the love ofGod rather than any  sense of self-satisfaction. I do not doubt that there is plenty inme that still needs  purification. And so I take it for myself first. It&#146;s theonly way we will be what  God is calling us to be -- like in a marriage: if I constantlyfocus what I think needs to  be changed in my spouse rather than on the ways I can love herbetter, I will make both of  us miserable for decades.    What is precious to me about this letter is thecombination. He spoke  of God-centeredness in our worship (with little focus uponman) in the same  breath with the radiance and warmth of thecongregation. This is our  heart&#146;s cry isn&#146;t it. They will know you areChristians by your  love. This is what I was yearning for in last week&#146;smessage when I said we  long for a fresh Biblical combination and balance of the holinessof God and the love of  God.    The point today is that, if we are to grow inour love to one another,  we must experience being loved by Christ with a deep, unshakablelove -- the love of  Romans 8:35, Who shall separate us from the love ofChrist? We must be  wonderstruck that the love of Christ holds us. That he holds usfirmly in the grip of his  love. The profound wonder -- that Christ, the Son of God loves us -- must grip us and hold  us and fill our minds. We must put it before our minds at thebeginning of the day (he  loves me), and then again at midmorning (he loves me), and then atnoon (he loves me), and  then at mid-afternoon (he loves me), and then at supper time (heloves me), and then  before bed (he loves me).     And as we take the Scriptures like Romans 8:35we must pray about this.  This is what I will call the Fasting Forty to focus onas we give the new  cards out next Sunday. To pray that this sense of being loved byChrist would fill us and  overflow from us.     Let&#146;s turn to one of Paul&#146;s prayersto see how crucial this  issue was for Paul as he prayed for the church: Ephesians 3:14-19.The reason I want you  to look at this as we close is because I saw in a new way how thispassage takes us into  the meaning of Romans 8:35, Who shall separate us from thelove of Christ?          14 For this reason, I bow my knees beforethe Father, 15 from whom    every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, 16 that Hewould grant you,    according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened withpower through His Spirit in    the inner man; 17 so that Christ may dwell in your heartsthrough faith; and that you,    being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehendwith all the saints what    is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to knowthe love of Christ which    surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all thefullness of God.        Notice what the goal of this prayer is in verse18: [That you]  may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadthand length and height  and depth, 19 and to know the love of Christ which surpassesknowledge. Paul wanted  for the Ephesians what I want us this morning: power to comprehendhow high and deep and  wide and long is the love of Christ. He admits it is beyond humancomprehension. We will  never get to the top or bottom or end of it in any direction.There will always be more of  it to discover and enjoy (cf. Eph. 2:7). But he wants us to provethe inexhaustibility of  Christ&#146;s love by experience, not just say it as a doctrine.    But how does he mean for us to be able[literally: be strong  enough] to comprehend this love? Do we stand outside it andlook at it the way we  would a building so that we can measure how tall and wide it is?No. Move backward into  verse 17 for the answer: That you,   being rooted andgrounded in love  ,  may have power to comprehend the love of Christ. The word forgrounded here is  rested on a foundation. So Paul uses two metaphors:one of a tree with roots,  one with a building with a foundation.     He says that, to comprehend the love of Christand prove the height and  depth of it we should be rooted in it. That is, the roots of ourlives should be sinking  down ever more deeply into the love of Christ. That&#146;s wherewe got our life. And he  said we should be founded on it. That is, the foundation of ourlives should be spread out  on the solid rock of the love of Christ for us.     This is how we prove in experience that thedepth and breadth of the  love of Christ are endless. Our roots never get to the bottom ofit and our broadening  foundation never run out of rock to build on. I think these twoimages are meant to show  us the same things as Romans 8:35, Nothing can separate usfrom the love of  Christ. The roots of our life are firmly held by the depthsof Christ&#146;s love.  And the foundation of our life is firmly supported by the rock ofChrist&#146;s love. We  cannot be plucked up or blown over. That is the point of Romans8:35, Nothing can  separate us from the love of Christ.    God is calling us to new depths of love foreach other and for those  outside. If that is going to happen, (and it is happening)something else must happen  first (which is happening). Paul&#146;s prayer must be answered:          [May God grant that we], being rooted andgrounded in love, may be    able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth andlength and height and    depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge.        Would you join me, and make it a matter ofearnest prayer that all of  us grasp more and more what it is to be loved by Christ -- nothingcan separate us from  his love. Then the power to love each other will flow freely.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
