    September 3, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE BLINDING EFFECTS OF SERVING GOD   (Luke 15:25-31)           


 Now his older son wasin the field, and when he    came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. Andhe summoned one of the    servants and  began  inquiring what these thingsmight be. And he said to    him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed thefattened calf, because he    has received him back safe and sound.      


 But he became angry, and was not willing togo in; and his father came    out and  began  entreating him. But he answeredand said to his father,    Look! For so many years I have been serving you, and Ihave never neglected a    command of yours; and  yet  you have never givenme a kid, that I might be    merry with my friends; but when this son of yours came, who hasdevoured your wealth with    harlots, you killed the fattened calf for him.      


 And he said to him,  My child, you have always    been with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to bemerry and rejoice, for this    brother of yours was dead and  has begun  tolive, and  was     lost and has been found.              Review     Up till now in Luke 15 Jesus is showingwith parables what it means  that he receives sinners and eats with them. This wasthe accusation of the  Pharisees and Scribes in verse 2. Jesus said, ineffect, when I receive  sinners and eat with them, it is like a shepherd seeking andfinding a lost sheep and  rejoicing; it is like a woman seeking and finding a lost coin andrejoicing; and it is  like a Father running out to welcome home a rebellious son who washumbled and repentant.  Jesus&#146; words and actions toward sinners are the love of Godreaching out for sinners.  That&#146;s what it means when he receives sinners and eats withthem.     A Word to the Prodigal&#146;s ElderBrother     Now at verse 25 the parable of the prodigalson takes a turn.  Instead of answering the question: what does it mean that Jesus iseating with  tax-gatherers and sinners, the question now is: what does it meanthat the Pharisees and  scribes are NOT eating with them? What does it mean that thePharisees and scribes are  grumbling about Jesus&#146; eating with them? That&#146;s whatthis last part of the  parable is about. Let&#146;s read the end of the first half of theparable, starting with  verse 24. The happy father says,          This son of mine was dead, and has cometo life again; he was lost,    and has been found. And they began to be merry. 25 Now his olderson was in the field, and    when he came and approached the house, he heard music anddancing. 26 And he summoned one    of the servants and began inquiring what these things might be.27 And he said to him,    Your brother has come, and your father has killed thefattened calf, because he has    received him back safe and sound. 28 But he became angry,and was not willing to go    in; and his father came out and  began entreating him. 29 But he answered    and said to his father, Look! For so many years I havebeen serving you, and I have    never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never givenme a kid, that I might be    merry with my friends; 30 but when this son of yours came, whohas devoured your wealth    with harlots, you killed the fattened calf for him. 31 Andhe said to him,  My     child, you have always been with me, and all that is mine isyours. 32 But we had to be    merry and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has begun  to    live, and  was  lost and has been found.        As we unpack this, most of us need to listenvery carefully. This is  passage for long-time church go-ers. This is a passage for peoplewho don&#146;t struggle  as much with running from God as they struggle with condemningthose who do. This is a  passage for people who tend to think of other people who need thispassage.     The elder brother represents the Pharisees andscribes who are standing  by suspiciously and condemningly, while Jesus is eating with tax-gatherers and sinners. So  let&#146;s see what Jesus shows us about these people and what heshows us about  God&#146;s love for them.    These words go straight to the heart of whatChristianity is. It&#146;s  a right relationship to God as our Father through faith. If we getthat wrong, all goes  wrong. And it seems that the elder brother got it wrong.     Slave or Son?     The key words to show this are the words ofthe elder brother in  verse 29:           Look!  (He says to his father) For so many years I have    been serving you, and I have never neglected a command of yours;and  yet     you have never given me a kid, that I might be merry with myfriends.        There are several clues here that the way herelates to his father is  dishonoring to his father and disuniting to his brother anddestructive to himself.           How does he see himself and his fatherrelating?              Answer: as master and slave. Look! For so many years Ihave been serving you.       Serving . The word is for what a servant ora slave does. This is not      the identity of a son, but of a slave. For so many yearsI have been   serving   you.                  Then he says, And I have neverneglected a command of      yours.              How does he see his father? As a issuer of commands. He seesthe father as a master giving      commandments, and himself as a slave paying obedience. This isnot the way the father      wants his children to relate to him. This is a distortion ofChristianity. It is not the      Christian life            Acts 17:25 says,           God is not served by human hands as thoughhe needed anything, for he    himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.        It dishonors God to treat him as a master in needof slave labor. What  honors God is not slave labor, but childlike faith in his all-sufficiency.    Jesus said in Mark 10:45,           The Son of Man did not come to be served,but to serve and to give    his life as a ransom for many.         Jesus did not come and hang out a help-wantedsign. He came and hung  out a  help-available  sign. Jesus is eating with sinnersbecause he is a doctor with  a cure, not because he is an employer with a labor shortage.    The Pharisees and scribes couldn&#146;t seethat because they  themselves had a totally different mindset: For so manyyears I have been serving  you, and I have never neglected a command of yours.    Test yourself here. I fear that at this pointmany might say, It  seems to me that the elder brother really has a legitimatecomplaint. If you say  that, you&#146;re not getting it. You are still thinking in theold way of master and  slave and works. Not the Christian way of Father and child faith.The question is not  whether the son really has kept all the commandments; the questionis whether the father  wants to be related to as commander to slave.     The Folly of a Slave Mentality     What happens when we relate to God thatway? Everything is  distorted.          We are disunited and alienated from the needyand sinners. Why? Because    we feel intuitively that we have worked hard to stay right withGod, and there is no way    that those who haven&#146;t worked like we have are going tocome in here as    Johnny-come-latelys and mooch off what is rightfully ours bysuch long-term, hard, loyal    slave labor. Thinking wrongly about our relation to God likethis alienates us from the    weak and sinners. It makes us angry and resentful of mercy.Instead of rejoicing with the    Father, we pout about our superior merit being overlooked.      It makes us into blamers. Notice verse 30:When this son of yours    came. . . Not: When my lost brother came home . .. but: This son    of yours . . . There is an ominous ring to this. It soundslike Adam saying to God:    This woman whom you gave to me, she made me do it.This son of    yours is the one that messed up. When we are relating toGod as slave to Master on    the basis of our hard work, instead of child to Father on thebasis of trust and grace, we    will be ready even to blame God for the mess-ups in the world.Our whole pattern of    thinking and feeling will keep us from grasping the dynamics ofgrace.        A Father&#146;s Tender Love for aHypocrite     What then does the father have to say aboutall this? What will  Jesus teach us about how God really relates to his children. Hereis the positive side of  the parable -- how the father relates to the elder brother. Keepin mind, now, that this  is Jesus reaching out to the Pharisees and the Scribes in thatvery room, looking out over  the heads of the harlots and drug dealers and Mafia. This is whatJesus says to those this  morning who have been going to church for decades and have grownhard and merciless and  excessively separatistic and who feel disgust more often than feelcompassion.     Notice five simple and gracious thingsthat the Father does to  the elder brother:       1. Verse 28b: And his fathercame out.      The father heard inside that his older son isangry and won&#146;t come  in. One of those horrible family moments when the whole dinner isabout to be ruined  because of someone is in a tiff and won&#146;t come to the table.Only this is far deeper  and far worse. What does the father do? How does he deal with hisson? He deals with him  the same way he dealt with the younger one. He does not send aservant to get him. He does  not holler from a distance and command his son to come into thehouse. He goes himself.  God came into the world to save hypocrites as well as harlots. Heis willing to approach  them face to face and . . . and what?      2. Verse 28c: And his fathercame out and began  entreating him.       I think Jesus means the word here to fly rightin the face of what the  elder brother would say. The brother would say in verse 29,I never neglected one of  your  commandments . And here we have the Fatherentreating not  commanding and the son resisting not complying. He has a right tocommand his son. But  even here in a critical moment when he has every right to be angrythat the elder brother  is so selfish and resentful and rude, he is not first angry. Hedoes not want slavish  obedience. He is entreating; exhorting; appealing to theson&#146;s heart. In Philemon 1:8  Paul says to his friend, Philemon,           Though I have enough confidence in Christto order you  (or    command you)    to do that which is proper,yet for love's sake I rather    appeal to you  (same word) .         This is the point: the father is not justtrying to get the son to  perform the right action; he is trying to awaken him to what arelationship of love is  like.      3. After the son&#146;s bittercomplaint, the father  responds in verse 31, and his first words are all important:And he said to him,  &#145;My child.      Not: My servant. Or: Myslave. But: My  child. In the original it is simply, Child. Withthis one word the  father exposes all the deep distortion in the son&#146;s heart.I have been serving  you and I never passed over one commandment . . . The fatherdidn&#146;t try to  argue that point. It would lead nowhere. The whole relationshipwas built on the wrong  footing. With one word he sets it right: Child. Hearmy word: Child. This is  the relationship we must have, if you are ever to join thebanquet.    And what is the essence of that relationship?      4. Verse 31: My child, youhave always been with  me. Or, literally: You are always with me.      With me. You are a child. I am your father. Andyou are with me.   With    me. With   me  . Here is the deepest void in the elderbrother&#146;s heart. He  lived in the house of the father and found no satisfaction frombeing  with  the  father. Some of the most ominous words in the elder brother&#146;smouth are these:  You have never given me a kid, that I might be merry with myfriends. Now this  is strange. Here is the heir of the estate. He has at his disposalflocks of goats and  herds of cattle. And he has a father who is manifestly kind andgracious. What then do  these hard, indicting words mean? They are the words of person forwhom the grace and  glory of his father have ceased to be his treasure. They are thewords of a person whose  heart is with his friends outside the family and who is feelinglocked in to the  father&#146;s table, when he would really rather be with others.    O how many people are in the Christian churchwho want out, and are  afraid to leave. When they hear the Father say, You arealways with me -- with  ME, it means nothing. He is no longer their treasure. He isa means to their  treasure. And if they could have their party with their friends,they would take their  goat and go.    O how we need to pray that our love would be toGod and not to his  gifts. But there is a word about gifts. God will even go to thislength.      5. The father says in verse 31,All that is mine is  yours.       Jesus is looking over the head of sinners andstaring the hardened  Pharisee right in the face and saying on behalf of God Almighty,All that is mine is  yours. As an inheritance for a son, not a wage for a slave.All that is mine  is yours --  IF  you will come in with the sinners. Ifyou will stop relating  to me as a slave. If you will be satisfied with all I am for youas a Father. If you will  receive grace and let it flow through you to your brother. If youstay out here on the  porch; if you insist on relating to me as a worthy slave . . .      The consequences are leftunmentioned.     Jesus is entreating the Pharisees. He isentreating all of us. Sinners  of the worldly kind and sinners of the religious kind. Come infrom the foreign country of  misery, and come in from the porch of hard-earned merit. Both aredeadly. But inside is  the banquet of grace, and forgiveness, and fellowship with an all-satisfying Father, and  an inheritance unfading, undefiled, incorruptible, kept in heavenfor all who live by  faith in grace and not by earning merit.
