       "I AM GOD ALMIGHTY, BE FRUITFUL ANDMULTIPLY"        BECOMING ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE        THAT WE MIGHT SAVE SOME      1 Corinthians 9:19-23    
   For though I am free from all  men,  I have made myself aslave to all, that I might win the more. 20 And to the Jews I becameas a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, asunder the Law, though not being myself under the Law, that I mightwin those who are under the Law; 21 to those who are without law, aswithout law, though not being without the law of God but under thelaw of Christ, that I might win those who are without law. 22 To theweak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become allthings to all men, that I may by all means save some. 23 And I do allthings for the sake of the gospel, that I may become a fellowpartaker of it.  The first question to ask is whether this remarkable testimony ofPaul is something we should imitate, or is this just something thatapostles did -- or that missionaries do who must adapt to othercultures?  The answer comes from one of the clearest commentaries on thesewords that Paul himself wrote in the next chapter. Look at 1Corinthians 10:31-11:1. Here the issue is exactly the same as in9:19ff., namely, how to relate to Jews and Greeks so as to win themfor Christ. He says,  Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to theglory of God. 32) Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or tothe church of God; [ in other words, adapt as much as you can innon-sinful ways ] 33) just as I also please all men in all things,not seeking my own profit, but the  profit  of the many, thatthey may be saved. [ That's the same as 9:22, "I have become allthings to all men, that I may by all means save some." Then comes theanswer to our question, in 11:1 ] Be imitators of me, just as Ialso am of Christ.  So that answer is: No, this is not a specifically apostolic ormissionary way of life. It is something that he meant for all theCorinthian believers to imitate. He was imitating Christ, and hewants us to imitate him. So hear this message this morning a Wordfrom God for you particularly and not just for someone else. Ask howyou, in your sphere of life can use your freedom the way Paul andJesus did, if by any means you might save some.  Now the second question to ask in this text is what Paul's aim is.Why has he made himself a slave to all? Why is he becoming "as a Jew"to the Jews? Why did he make himself as a "lawless one" to thelawless, and weak to the weak? Which is the same now as asking, Whyshould we?  It's a tremendously important question. Paul is telling us to liveand act in ways that are different from the way we would act if wedidn't share his aim in life. So it makes a big difference if we havethe same aim Paul does here. What was his aim?  Five times he says that his aim is to win people. Verse 19: "thatI might win the more." Verse 20: " that I might win the Jews . . .that I might win those under the law." Verse 21: "That might winthose who are without law." Verse 22: "That I might win the weak."  So five times he says that his aim in adapting to the way peoplelive is to win them. Then at the end of verse 22 in his summarystatement he says, " I have become all things to all men, that I mayby all means save some." So he says his aim differently here. Fivetimes it was "to win" people; and now it is "to save" people.  Then in verse 23 he gives one last aim: "And I do all things forthe sake of the gospel, that I may become a fellow partaker of it." Ibelieve this means exactly what R. H. Lenski says it means. Paul issaying, "If I omit this concern of love for others, although throughmy work, devoid of such love, many others may be saved, yet I myselfwould not be saved." In other words, Paul knew that his faith inChrist would be utterly inauthentic and false, if he abandoned thepattern of life set by Jesus and no longer cared for other people.  So Paul tells us his aim in three ways: 1) to win others; 2) tosave others; 3) to be partaker in the benefits of the gospel himself.Now what does this mean? Win others for what? Save others from what?Partake in what benefits of the gospel?  The most straightforward answer is given in Romans 5:9: "Havingnow been justified by His blood, we shall be  saved from the wrath[of God]  through Him." Of all Paul's uses of the word "save" inhis letters this is the one place where he tells us explicitly whatwe are saved from. When we put our trust in Christ, we are saved from"the wrath of God."  So that is the aim of Paul in becoming all things to all people.Verse 22: "I have become all things to all men, that I may by allmeans save some" -- from the wrath of God. The gospel is the goodnews that God has made a way to save us from his own wrath. In 1Thessalonians 1:10 Paul says that "Jesus delivers us (=saves us) fromthe wrath to come."  That's what Paul seeks to save people   from  , when headapts to their way of life. But now what does he win them for? Or:what benefits of the gospel does Paul hope to share in when he issaved from the wrath of God?  Jesus tells us the alternative to the wrath of God. In John 3:36he says, "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he whodoes not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideson him." The alternative to the wrath of God abiding on us, iseternal life. This is what Paul win's people for. This is what hewants to be a fellow partaker of.  So now we know our goal and aim. Our aim, like Paul's is to savepeople from the wrath of God and to win them for eternal life; and inloving people like this we prove the reality of our own faith andconfirm our participation in the gospel.  A question that presses itself on me here is this: is one of thereasons that we make as little effort as we do in winning others thefact that we don't believe the wrath of God is coming? For many todaythe good news of Jesus Christ is conceived almost entirely as anotherstrategy to handle psychological needs -- depression, grief,abandonment, loneliness, anger, low self-esteem, fear, etc. And thegospel does have an impact on all those things. But that is not whatmakes it the gospel. If the gospel did not touch any of those thingsin this life (which is conceivable), it would still be unspeakablygood news. Do you believe that?  What makes the gospel good news is that I am already acquitted inthe courtroom of heaven. There is no condemnation to those in ChristJesus. The sentence of infinite, holy, wrath has been revoked in mycase. Jesus absorbed it for me. Therefore, as 1 Thessalonians 5:9says, "God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvationthrough our Lord Jesus Christ."  But O what a difference there is for those who do not embrace thegospel! Romans 2:5 says, "Because of your stubbornness andunrepentant heart you are  storing up wrath for yourself in the dayof wrath  and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." Iwonder if we believe this. Very little in our culture helps usbelieve this. It is a massive world view change from what most peoplethink. There is coming a day of wrath and righteous judgment of God.Everyone, Paul says, will give an account of himself to God (Romans14:12). And there are only two verdicts and two sentences: guilty ornot guilty; and eternal life or eternal wrath and punishment (Matthew25:46).  If this is a minor part of your thought world, if you don't thinkabout this very much, then it will be hard for you to feel the senseof sorrow and urgency that Paul felt for the lost people around him.What we need to do is ponder the wrath of God that is coming -- tomeditate, think about, reflect on, mull over, turn over in our minds,and dwell on -- the reality of the wrath of God. Until this figuresas largely in our world view as it did for Paul, we will not have thepassion for evangelism that he had.  To help us do this I have written the STAR article this week aboutthe wrath of God and included numerous texts about it. We need tomemorize some of these and expose our minds to them as often as weare exposed to the messages of the media that the big things in lifeare money and position and coolness. One of the biggest realities inthe universe is the wrath of God, and it is coming on all those whodo not trust in Jesus, "who delivers us from the wrath to come."  We have time for one last question in this text: What is Paul'sstrategy for winning and saving others? The answer is:  hisstrategy was to use his Christian freedom to become the slave ofall.  1 Corinthians 9:19, "For though I am free from all ,  Ihave made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more." I use myfreedom to become a servant.  In 1520 Martin Luther, the great Reformer in Germany wrote atreatise called "The Freedom of the Christian." He began it with thisparadox:  A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. AChristian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.  Then he explained:  These two theses seem to contradict each other . . . [But] bothare Paul's own statements, who says in 1 Corinthians 9:19, "Forthough I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all,"and in Romans 13:8, "Owe no one anything, except to love oneanother." Love, by its very nature, is ready to serve and be subjectto him who is loved.  So Paul's strategy is love. It's exactly what he said in Galatians5:13, "You were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn yourfreedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve oneanother." Use your liberty to love by serving. That's what Paul sayshe is doing here in verse 19: "Though I am free from all  men, I have made myself a slave (or servant) to all." That's what Paul-- and Jesus -- mean by love.  You can see this even more clearly in the three things Paul saysabout his relation to the law in these verses. Notice: First, verse20b: "To those who are under the Law, [I became] as under the Law, though not being myself under the Law ." So he says he is NOTunder law. Second, verse 21: "To those who are without law, [Ibecame] as without law,  though not being without the law ofGod ." So he says, in the second place, that he is not without thelaw of God. First, he is not under the law, but, secondly, he is notwithout the law of God. Third, Verse 21b: "But [I am] under the lawof Christ."  So there are three statements about his relation to the law: 1) Iam not under law; 2) I am not without the law of God; 3) I am underthe law of Christ.  You might say, "That sure sounds involved." But life is involved.This is the sort of careful thinking you must do if you are going totake the risks involved in adapting to all kinds of people so thatyou might save some. As soon as you say, "I have made myself slave toall" (v. 19), and "I have become all things to all men" (v. 23), youare on the brink of idolatry and compromise and worldliness and sin.You are walking the razor's edge between fruitless separatism andunprincipled expediency. If you fall one way you are of no usebecause you have no connection with the world; if you fall the otherway you are of no use because you are just like the world.  How do you keep your faith and your freedom and your radical zealto win people and not just copy people? The answer is that you thinkhard about your relation to the law of God -- the way Paul did. Andwhat you come to is this:  1) As a Christian, I am not "under law" (v. 20) -- that is, I amnot bound to earn my salvation by the law, nor am I bound to live bythe ceremonial, dietary, separation laws of the Old Testament (forexample, circumcision, holy days, no ham and cat fish, no mixedfibers, no meat offered to idols, and so on). I am free to go to thehome of an animist and humanist and eat whatever they put before mein order to win them for Christ (1 Corinthians 10:27).  2) As a Christian I am nevertheless not without God's law (v. 21).In 1 Corinthians 7:19 Paul says, "Circumcision is nothing, anduncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is the keeping of thecommandments of God." This is a remarkable verse! It says thatcircumcision, which was a commandment of God in the Old Testament isnegligible for Christians, but the commandments of God are notnegligible. This is why we distinguish between the ceremonial law andthe moral law. As Christians we submit to the moral law of God. Weare not without the law of God, as Paul says.  3) Which is defined for us in verse 21 as "the law of Christ." Weare under the law of Christ. This is the law of love. In Galatians6:2 Paul says, "Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the lawof Christ." The law of Christ is the law that fulfills all laws:Galatians 5:14, "The whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in thestatement, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" This iscalled in James 2:8 the "royal law" and "the law of liberty" (1:25;2:12). It's the law that free people submit to gladly because theyare led by the Holy Spirit. That's what Paul means when he says inGalatians 5:18, "If you are led by the Spirit, you are not underlaw." Instead, you bear the fruit of love, and so submit gladly tothe law of Christ, the law of love.  And what does it look like.  In freedom, for love's sake, you try to overcome unnecessary,alienating differences that cut you off from unbelievers.. Infreedom, for love's sake, you learn the Manike language and translatethe Bible. In freedom, for love's sake, you eat dinner together theway they eat dinner. In freedom, for love's sake, you dress prettymuch like the middle class American natives. In freedom, for love'ssake, you get into their politics and their sports and theirbusinesses.  And all the while you keep a vigilant watch over your heart to seeif you are in the law of Christ. Here are two tests of how you aredoing in this delicate balancing act. I close with these:  1. Are you becoming more worldly minded than they are becomingspiritually minded? If so, you have probably crossed the line of thelaw of Christ. Christ does not call you to lose your holiness, but togain theirs.  2. Is your passion for winning your friends and family growing, oris it shrinking as you become all things to them? If it is shrinking,then you are not in the law of Christ at that point.  Here is the sum of the matter: Christ died to set us free. Freefrom the wrath of God, and free from the loveless limits of the law.Free for love and eternal life. Are we using our freedom to make thisgood news plain? Or are we so separatistic that we have no connectionwith unbelievers; or are we so worldly they don't know we haveanything radically different to offer?  O may the Lord grant us to use our freedom to become the servantsof all, that we might by all means save some! Copyright 1996 John Piper
