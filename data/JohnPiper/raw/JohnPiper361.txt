 October 18, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WHY THE SAINTS MINISTER TO THE BODY    (Ephesians 4:7-16)         But to each one of us grace was given according to      the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, "When He      ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives, and He      gave gifts to men." (Now this expression, "He ascended," what      does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower      parts of the earth? He who descended is Himself also He who      ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all      things.) And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets,      and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for      the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the      building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the      unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to      a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to      the fulness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be      children, tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by      every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness      in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are      to grow up in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even      Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held      together by that which every joint supplies, according to the      proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of      the body for the building up of itself in love.                We are going to spend two weeks on this text. Today we will ask   the question, "Why do the saints minister to the body of Christ?"   Next week we will ask the question, "How do the saints minister to   the body of Christ?" Another way to say it would be: today we ask   about the aim or goal of every-member ministry, and next week we   ask about the ways and means that members use to minister to the   body.        But before we can take up either question I need to justify the   assumption that every member is to minister to the body of Christ.   Why do I think that?        The answer is found in verse 7 and verses 11-12. In verse 7   Paul talks about how each individual Christian is gifted by Christ   with various measures of grace; and in verses 11-12 he talks about   how the church is gifted by Christ with certain ministering people   who equip the saints to minister to the body.        Verse 7: "But to each one of us grace was given according to   the measure of Christ's gift." Here the focus is on Christ's   giving each believer varied grace. You are uniquely graced with   Christ's gift. This means that you are not an accident in the body   of Christ. When you received grace, it was because Christ gave it   in a measure suited to his good purposes for you and for the   body.        This does not yet prove that every member is to be a minister   to the body. But it does lay the foundation for it when it comes   in verses 11-12. "Each of us" is given grace not according to the   measure of our worth or merit, but according to the measure that   Christ decided to give. Romans 12:6 says almost the same thing:   "We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us."   Our different giftedness is owing to sovereign grace, bestowed   according to the will of Christ, the head. The Head knows what is   good for the body.        Now verses 11-12 make the point of every-member ministry   explicit. After describing (in vv. 8-10) how Christ rose from the   dead and ascended to heaven like a triumphant general with his   wagons full of booty, ready to distribute it to his troops, Paul   says, "And He &#91;Christ&#93; gave some as apostles, and some as   prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and   teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,   to the building up of the body of Christ."        This is different from verse 7. There the point was that every   believer is gifted by Christ with varied grace. Here the point is   that the church is gifted by Christ with people in varied offices:   "some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some as   pastors and teachers (probably one office)." These gifts to the   church--these people--are charged with equipping the saints, that   is, the believers. (All believers are saints in the new testament;   they are set apart for God.)        The word for equipping usually means fixing something that's   broken (as when nets are torn, Matt. 4:21) or supplying something   that is lacking (as in 1 Thess. 3:10, "We desire to supply, or   equip, what is lacking in your faith."). So the point of verses   11-12 is that Christ not only gives varied grace to each believer   in the church, he also gives leaders to the church whose job is to   repair what's broken and supply what's lacking in the   believers.        We will talk more about this next week. But think how   significant this is for the nature of the church. Each of you is   personally gifted by Christ with varied grace, and yet not so   perfectly that you are not in need of fixing and supply by   apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. No one may   say: "I am gifted and graced by Christ himself, I have no need of   apostolic authority (which I believe comes through the New   Testament), or prophetic encouragement, or evangelistic training,   or pastoral nurture, or human teachers to apply the Bible to my   life." This text makes plain that all of you are gifted with a   measure of grace, and all of you are in some measure lacking the   improvement of grace. The one proves that you are vitally needed   by the church, and the other proves that the church is vitally   needed by you.        But the main point still hasn't been made. Verse 12 goes on to   say that the leaders equip the saints for a specific purpose,   namely, "for the work of service" or, "for the work of ministry."   The fixing of what is broken and the supplying of what is lacking   in the saints is not an end in itself. The leaders don't stop then   and say, "O good, now we have fixed and supplied saints. The work   is done." No, the fixing and supplying are meant to make the   saints into servants, or ministers.        So this finally is the justification of the assumption I   started with, namely, that every saint--every Christian--is a   minister. This is why today's message can be titled, "Why the   saints minister to the body," and next week's message can be   titled, "How the saints minister to the body."        Isn't it remarkable that Paul's vision of the body of Christ is   that it needs so much work done on it. Let that sink in a minute.   It will help keep us from being discouraged when we realize how   imperfect the church is. It starts with people becoming believers   and receiving grace according to the measure of Christ's gift (v.   7). Then all these saints need to avail themselves of leaders who   equip them for ministry. But whom is that ministry for? It's for   the all those same saints who are ministering--the body of Christ.   You see this at the end of verse 12: "For the equipping of the   saints for the work of service (or ministry), to the building up   of the body of Christ." So in spite of the fact that all the   saints are gifted with grace directly from Christ himself, we all   need the ministry of the saints to build us up; and, not only   that, we need the Leader Saints, too, to fix us and supply us in   ways that help us be ministering saints to other saints.        Now the specific question for today is, Why all this ministry?   What's the goal? What are we all supposed to be doing here at   Bethlehem? What is it to be church? Or to do church? This is what   we have been asking for these weeks together.        Verse 12 sums it up in the phrase "building up of the body of   Christ." The goal of all ministry is the building up of the body   of Christ. This is what we want to think about for the rest of our   time this morning. What is it?        First of all, notice that it is not exactly the same as   building up individuals. That is part of it for sure: Paul said in   Romans 15:2, "Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, for   his upbuilding" (exactly the same word: oikodomen). We are   supposed to build each other up in faith and hope and love and   holiness.        But that is not what verse 12 says. Here the ministry of the   saints is aimed at building up of the body of Christ. What Paul   wants to stress here is the aim of strengthening the whole, not   just the parts. This is not as easy for us to grasp, but we must   try not to let our individualistic bent twist the text. The aim of   your ministry as a Christian--and you all have one--is to build up   the body as a whole.        Now what does that mean? Verses 13-15 give the answer. Look at   verse 13 first. It says that we aim at building up the body "until   we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of   the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature   which belongs to the fulness of Christ."        This confirms that Paul wants to stress the building up of the   body as a whole , not just individuals. It says the aim is unity   of faith and unity of knowledge. Don't miss the unmodern flavor of   this: unity of knowledge is definitely not politically correct.   The key word today is diversity, not unity, especially when it   comes to claims to know anything about the Son of God. But Paul   would respond to the relativism of our day with these words:   building up the body of Christ means ministering in such a way as   to create a unity of knowledge as the basis of the unity of   faith.        Any efforts at unity in the body of Christ that minimize the   unity of knowledge will not build up the body. I have the sense   that we are reaching the crest of a wave of indifference to   doctrinal truthfulness and to the unity of knowledge and the   importance of theology. The most recent  Christianity   Today  describes the change over the last 50 years:        Fifty years ago evangelicals were fully engaged in      battling modernists' attempts to detach Christianity from      historic orthodoxy. This kept evangelical concerns centered on      the content of Christian belief--on the propositional truths of      Scripture. Today evangelicals seem far more interested in      questions of worship. This has led in two different directions:      a movement toward the liturgical by the intellectually      inclined, and a movement toward the charismatic by the average      churchgoer. Both represent a shift in emphasis away from      knowledge about God toward the experience of God.        I think that is exactly right. There has been a shift away from   interest in the right knowledge of God toward a desire for a more   immediate experience of God that does not have to bother with the   labors of knowledge. But I suspect that we may be seeing the   bottom of this curve.        Yesterday's  Star-Tribune  published (apparently   approvingly) an article by two atheists who defended the aim of   Gene Kasmar to remove the Bible from Brooklyn Center public   schools. They wrote: "It is true that the Bible has some   worthwhile material . . . However, those worthwhile parts could   probably be contained in a pamphlet." The reason I say the Tribune   seems to have published this approvingly is that the caption under   the picture of the Bible, with no quotes around it to indicate it   only represented the opinion of the writers, said, "The Bible is   filled with divinely approved mistreatment of children."        What I suspect is going to happen in the coming years is that   this kind of open hostility to the Bible and to Bible-believing   people will increase. Non-compromising evangelicals will recognize   that we are not the big, influential force in America we thought   we were. And we will begin to re-emphasize the truths that make us   distinct instead of constantly omitting hard truths and watering   down things to make them appealing to a secular culture that is   not taking the bait. When this happens we will rediscover the   crucial importance of knowledge and doctrine and theology. We will   awaken to the fact that very few people in recent years have been   developing an articulate defense of the Bible that can stand   before the hostile mockery of the  Star-Tribune . But it   has been done before and it will be done again.        Now notice in the middle of verse 13 the phrase "to a mature   man." "...until we attain to the unity of faith and of the   knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man." This is the aim of   our ministry of building up the body--that the body attain "to a   mature man." Now that is not an individual. Yes we ought to all be   mature. But here Paul is referring to Christ as a "mature man."   The next phrase explains it: "To the measure of the stature which   belongs to the fullness of Christ." The mature, complete, full man   here is Christ.        Paul pictures Christ as a mature man, full grown in stature.   Then he sees the church as the body of this full-grown man. Only   the body is still in the process of being built up. We are to   minister to each other with a view not just of helping each other   mature, but with a view to the whole body attaining to the mature   man. In other words, since we are the body of Christ, we should   become mature as the body, the mature man, the measure of the   stature of the fulness of Christ.        Verse 15 uses the metaphor of growing instead of building to   say the same thing: "speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up   in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ." Growing up   into Christ in verse 15 is the same as attaining to a mature man   in verse 13.        The aim of our ministry--your ministry, with your grace and   gifts--is to become a body of Christ that is unified in faith and   unified in knowledge, and that grows more and more into the kind   of unified person that Christ is. I said this is not easy for us   to grasp. But I want to say it, even if I don't fully understand   it.        The aim of the ministry is not just that individuals be built   up, but that the body take on a personality like Christ's and a   strength like Christ's and a love like Christ's and a spirit like   Christ's.        We have much to learn here. We are, as Americans, utterly   devoted to personal individual fulfillment and satisfaction that   the idea of devoting our lives and ministries to building a body   of Christ that as a whole looks Christ-like and as a whole has   strong faith and as a whole has unified knowledge and as a whole   looks and acts like the mature man, Christ Jesus--the idea of   devoting ourselves to that, is very difficult to grasp.        But I call you to it. To meditate on it. And to pray over it.   And to long for it. And to keep on with me, as we take it further   next week in asking HOW we minister to this end.
