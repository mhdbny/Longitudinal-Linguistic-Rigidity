    June 25, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Dying as a Means of Loving (Part Two)   (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)          Love is patient, love kind, and is notjealous; love does not brag    and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seekits own, is not provoked,    does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice inunrighteousness, but    rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things,hopes all things, endures    all things.              Introduction: Unless A Grain OfWheat...     Two weeks ago I believe the Lord gave me aword for us from John  12:24-26.          Truly, truly, I say to you, unless agrain of wheat falls into the    earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, itbears much fruit. He who    loves his life loses it; and he who hates his life in this worldshall keep it to life    eternal. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am,there shall My servant    also be; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.        We saw that there were four great promises andfour life-shaking  demands.           Your life will bear fruit,                         if it falls like a seed into the ground anddies.                   You will keep your life for eternallife,                        if you hate your life in this world.                   You will be with Jesus where he is,                        if you follow him -- to Calvary.                   God the Father will honor you,                         if you serve Jesus.            And so we closed last time with the question:how then must I die as a  father and husband and pastor in order that I might bear fruit?How must we die as a  church in order that we might bear fruit? We are praying forrevival -- for a great  awakening in our church and our city and in the whole Christianmovement. But we have seen  that if we would be revived with fruit-bearing power, dying willhave to precede reviving.  If we are to see Christ and show Christ this summer we must alsodie with Christ.    Now someone might hear the words of Jesus inJohn 12:24-26 and ask, Is  this a contradiction of salvation by grace  through faith ?            Die to bear fruit.            Hate your life in this world to haveeternal life.             Follow Jesus to be where he is in glory.            Serve him to be honored by his Father.             What became of John 3:16?           For God so loved the world that he gavehis only begotten Son so    that whoever  believes   on him  shall not perish buthave eternal life.        But now Jesus says in John 12:25,  He who hates his life in  this world   shall keep it to eternal life. So do wehave eternal life by  believing   on Jesus, or by  hating our lives  in this world? Does John12:25 contradict John  3:16?     The answer is no, John 12:25 defines John 3:16.What Jesus means by  believe on Jesus is something much deeper and morelife-changing than we often  realize. One of the great passions of my life is to discover whattrue saving faith is and  learn how to live by it. When Jesus says that we have eternal lifeas a gift   by  believing  , and then says that we have eternal life  if we hate our lives in  this world  , he is not nullifying faith, he is clarifyingfaith.       When he says that we must  die  like seedin the ground,            and that we must  hate our lives  inthis world,              and that we must take up our cross and follow him  on the Calvary      road,                  and that we must  serve him  insteadof money (since no one can        serve two masters),                    what he is doing is describing the way faithlives.     That&#146;s why he can attach the same promisesto this way of life  that he attaches to faith. Believe on Jesus and you will notperish but have eternal  life, and Hate your life in this world, and you willkeep it for eternal  life. First, the promise of eternal life is given to the actof  believing.   Then, the promise of eternal life is given to the act of  hatingyour life  in this  world. The reason both are true is because hating your life inthis world is what faith  always does. It&#146;s the way faith lives. It&#146;s the evidencethat faith is alive and  real. Faith treasures Christ so deeply that competing treasuresdie to us and we die to  them. This death to the world (as Paul calls it in Galatians 6:14)results in decisions  that often look to the world as if you hate your life.    But this dying to the world is not an earning  or  meriting  of  eternal life through the rigors of asceticism or through thespiritual disciplines of the  Christian life. You cannot earn or merit anything from God whoalready owns you and  everything you have. Salvation is by grace through faith. And allthese other things are  the evidences and credentials of true faith.     Hating Our Lives; Loving Each Other     Now the question today is: what does thisdying like a seed and  this hating of your life in this world have to do with loving eachother? We began the  series on love back on March 12 by reading 1 Corinthians 13 -- thegreat love chapter. I  will end the series today in the same chapter -- even thoughvirtually all sermons from  the Bible are sermons on love -- it&#146;s foundation, or itsempowerment, or its nature,  or its forms, or its incentives, or its goals. Everything isrelated to love. So we are  not leaving it.    I invite you to turn to 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.Paul gives 15  descriptions of what love is. And what struck me was how virtuallyall of them involve  what Jesus called a dying or a hating of your life in thisworld.                          Love is patient,                     love is kind,  and                      is not jealous;                     love does not brag  and                        is not arrogant,                     (5) does not act unbecomingly;                     it does not seek its own,                     is not provoked,                     does not take into account a wrong suffered,                        (6) does not rejoice inunrighteousness, but                     rejoices with the truth;                     (7) bears all things,                     believes all things,                     hopes all things,                     endures all things.                            We are praying for revival. It will have tolook like this when it  comes or it will not be of the Holy Spirit -- love is the fruit hebears. So if we are on  the right track -- that there must be a dying before there is areviving -- then it is not  surprising to see that before there can be love there must bedeath, or that love is a  form of death.    Let&#146;s take a few examples so you can seethis in the text.    Take from verse 4 the description, Loveis patient, and  from verse 5, Love is not provoked. More literally,verse 4 says, Love  suffers long. The phrase in verse 5 is also rendered,Love is not easily  angered (NIV) or, Love is not irritable (RSV).So you can see that these  two descriptions of love are different sides of the same coin:not easily provoked,  irritated or angered is the flip side of suffers longand is patient.    Now by nature none of us likes to beinterrupted when things are going  well. We do not like delays in our plans. We all have a strongcraving for a trouble-free  life and we tend to get irritated when our best-laid plans goawry. We don&#146;t like  traffic tie ups on the freeway when we have an appointment. Wedon&#146;t like overheated  cars on vacation. We don&#146;t like for babies to cry through thenight. We don&#146;t  like checks to get lost in the mail. We like it when life flowsaccording to plan and  pleasure. And when it doesn&#146;t our nature is be provoked andto complain and grumble  and murmur and be angry and critical.    Now Paul says, Love suffers long . . .and is not (easily)  provoked. So what becomes of this whole side of us thatsuffers short -- has a short  fuse -- and that is easily provoked and easily complains andeasily grumbles and easily  gets angry and easily criticizes? The answer is: it must die. Tolove like this is to die.  If I am to be like this something in me must die. My strongcraving for a trouble-free  life must die. My need for an uninterrupted schedule must die. Mydemandingness that  frustrations and interference get out of my way must die.    We simply cannot love the way Paul describesuntil we die.    Or take the descriptions of love in the middleof verse 4: love  does not brag  and  is not arrogant. We all love to bemade much of. We like to  be admired. We like it when people notice our successes and missour failures. We like it  when we hear people say nice things about us. But we don&#146;tlike it when people make  fun of us or criticize us or laugh at us or humiliate us.     So we have developed strategies for minimizingour failures and  maximizing our successes. We tend to draw attention to the one andcover over the other.  There are crude ways of doing this like overt bragging andboasting and developing a  certain cocky swagger or talking with a kind of devil-may-careconceit or an in-your-face  kind of arrogance. In fact in America we have turned the vice ofbragging into a virtue of  entertainment.     But there are also more subtle, refined,acceptable ways of expressing  our pride -- like bringing the conversation back again and againto ourselves and what  we&#146;ve done, or even more subtly by constantly talking aboutour woundedness or our  sadness, and about how badly things have gone for us. Self-pityand boasting are both  forms of pride: one is pride in the heart of the weak, and theother is pride in the heart  of the strong.     Now Paul says, Love does not brag and isnot arrogant. That  is, it does not speak much about itself and is not puffed up withits achievements or too  concerned about its hurts. Love is other-directed, not self-consumed. Which means that a  massive craving in our hearts must die, if we are going to love.We&#146;re not puffed up  because we decide to be. We are puffed up by fallen sinful humannature. This comes from  deep within who we are as corrupt human beings. If love is humbleand other-directed, love  is death. The glory-loving, self-exalting, attention-seeking,whining, pouting,  self-pitying me has to die.     This is why Jesus said, Unless a grain ofwheat falls into the  ground and die it remains alone -- alone in its self-absorbed,self-asserting,  self-enhancing prison -- but if it dies, it bears much fruit-- the fruit of love  and all the people that will see Christ in that love.    Or take the key phrase in verse 5: Lovedoes not seek its  own. I don&#146;t think this means that it is wrong to wantto be happy. Because in  verse 3 Paul argues that if you don&#146;t love it  profits you nothing. So  it&#146;s not wrong to want the right kind of profit. Whathe&#146;s saying is that love  does not seek its own personal, private preference withoutreference to what may be good  for other people. Love seeks its joy and its profit in the good ofothers, not just in  private gratification.     When Paul says, Love seeks not itsown, he is not saying  that you shouldn&#146;t stand up for your own convictions -- hedied for his convictions.  He is saying that you must be sure that the strength of yourconviction is in proportion  to the conviction being God&#146;s not just yours. To the degreethat your preference is  yours and not compellingly found in God&#146;s word, to thatdegree should you be slow to  seek it, and slow to get angry when others don&#146;t share it.Love seeks not its  own. It seeks the good of the many, not just the comfort ofself.     So if we are going to love, we are going tohave to die to our  own. Love seeks not its own. What does it do? It dies to itsown. Unless a  grain of wheat fall into the ground and die it remains alone, butif it dies (to its own)  it bears much fruit.     A Practical Application     Let&#146;s take our worship life as anexample of this. This is  real. This is no hypothetical thing among us. We are worshippingdifferently during the  summer than we do during the school year. And the biggest issue isnot music and form, but  love. How will we respond to each other in this season ofdifference? The change of the  summer is intentional. It&#146;s not the decision of the MasterPlanning Team, but of the  staff and elders. There are several reasons. I&#146;ll mentionone.    Before this year is over a task force, spun offfrom the Master  Planning Team, will have been formed and will have fleshed out howthe new Vision  Statement will affect our worship life together. This in turn willshape whom we call to  be our music and worship leader. By worshipping differently duringthe summer we give that  task force, as well as the rest of us, a real chance to see whatit is like to engage with  God this way on Sunday morning. For fifteen years we have gonehard after God in fairly  uniform way on Sunday morning. Now for about 12 weeks we will gohard after God in another  way. Neither is perfect. We who lead certainly are not perfect.But when the summer is  over, the task force will have much better insight into howBethlehem can meet God most  powerfully -- for his glory and for our joy.    The greatest issue before us is not our worshipform, but our love.  Love seeks not its own. Love dies to its own. Thereare hundreds among us who  are joyful, some to the point tears, that we are approaching andlingering in the presence  of the Lord the way we are for the first thirty minutes of thesesummer services. It fits  them. It helps them. It releases affections for the Lord. It healsand edifies and  empowers. But most of all it helps them focus on God and engagewith God and commune with  God. Many of these people have not sought their ownway for years. They have  submitted to another way. They have yielded to what others saw asgood and helpful.    Now, this summer, the shoe is on the otherfoot, and the test is  whether those who prefer the other way will be patient and willyield, at least for a  season, in love. Love suffers long and is kind. . . Love isnot easily provoked. . .  Love seeks not its own.     We began this series on love with a quote fromFrancis Schaeffer to the  effect that when Christians differ there is a golden opportunityto show the world how we  love each other. Differences are not the end of love, they are theoccasion for love.  Which means an occasion for death. One of the reasons it&#146;s soeasy to walk away from  a difference instead of working it out is that you don&#146;t haveto die.     But what we have seen for two weeks is thatbefore there will be  revival there will be a dying in each of us; and before we see agreat resurgence of love  we will have to die.     Being long-suffering means           dying to the desire for an untroubledlife.            Having no jealousy means dying to thedesire for unshared affection.            Not boasting means dying to the desire tocall attention to our      successes            Not acting unbecomingly means dying tothe desire to express our      freedom offensively.            Not seeking our own way means dying tothe dominance of our own      preferences.            Not being easily provoked means dying tothe need for no      frustrations.            Not taking account of wrongs means dyingto the desire for revenge.            Bearing all things and enduring allthings means dying to the desire      to run away from the pain of obedience.             So the call of the Lord on our lives in theseweeks and in this summer,  and as we gather tonight in earnest pursuit of awakening and allthe fullness of God, is:  are we willing to pay the price of love? Love at home, love at theoffice, love in the  neighborhood, love in the body of believers? Are we willing todie? If we are this  satisfied with all that God is for us in Christ, then the promiseswill surely come true:  we will bear much fruit, we will live forever, we will be with theLord, and the Father  will honor us.    When Jesus calls a man, Dietrich Bonhoeffersaid, he bids him come and  die. Come. Reckon yourself dead to sin and alive to love.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
