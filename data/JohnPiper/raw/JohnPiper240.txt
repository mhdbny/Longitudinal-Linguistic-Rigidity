        A KINGDOM THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN    (Hebrews 12:25-29)        See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did   not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much   less shall we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. His   voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, "Yet once   more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven." This   phrase, "Yet once more," indicates the removal of what is shaken,   as of what has been made, in order that what cannot be shaken may   remain. Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that   cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship,   with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire.        I was eating supper with a group of pastors at the Navigators'   headquarters in Colorado Springs Tuesday evening and the word came   to us that there had been a major earthquake in San Francisco and   that part of the Bay bridge was down, and that's all we knew, we   didn't have any television or radio. One of the men at my table   said, "If the Bay Bridge is down this is serious &#151; Let's   pray." And in the middle of the meal we bowed and asked the Lord's   mercy be shown to the people in the Bay area.        I went back to my room later that night and the Lord just   seemed to come upon me with an unusual great burden to pray about   something I just had no information on at all except this could be   awesome. So I found myself praying earnestly that God would use   whatever had happened there to turn hearts to Him and to cause His   purposes of mercy in the world to prosper. The next morning when   all the thirty pastors gathered for one of our meetings we heard a   little more and we spent time in prayer again as different ones   read Scripture and prayed. As I was praying the text that came to   my mind was Hebrews 12:25-29, "Let us be grateful for receiving a   kingdom that cannot be shaken." And I read it while we were   praying and the men were moved and we prayed even more earnestly   on the basis of this text that God would turn the tragedy into a   triumph by shaking the affections of people loose from the world   and putting them on the kingdom of God.        When we were done praying and the seminar was about to get   under way, I felt so constrained about this that I left the room   momentarily and called Shelley long distance and told her that I   believed the Lord wanted me to change my text and sermon for this   Sunday and bring a message from the Lord concerning the   earthquake. That's what I want to do this morning.        I'd like to pray before we begin&#133;        Oh Father in heaven its times like this in the life of a nation   when the voice of the Lord needs to be heard and You have much to   say and we have little time in which to say it. So come, Father,   boil everything down to the bare essentials, sharpen the arrow of   Your Word, may it sink home to do its appointed work of mercy in   the lives of every person here. I ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.        What is God trying to say to us in this earthquake? To find   out, we turn to the Bible. God's written word is given to help us   interpret his voice in nature &#151; whether it is the voice of   the wind in Hurricane Hugo, or in plane crashes, or in car   crashes, or in the voice of the earth in San Francisco. The Bible   is not silent about earthquakes. And when they awaken the   attention of our nation we need to go back and remember what they   mean.        There are four points that I think would be helpful to   make.        1. God has appointed a great earthquake to bring this world to   a close. A final shaking of the earth and the heavens some day   that will end this fallen creation as we know it and bring the   kingdom of God to consummation.        2. Before that great shaking comes God has also appointed that   there be an increasing frequency and intensity of other   earthquakes and calamities leading up to that great end the way   labor pains lead up to the birth of a child.        3. Before the end of this age, God in His great mercy is   offering to everyone who believes in his Son a kingdom that cannot   be shaken, and will never end.        4. Therefore, let us worship God with reverence and awe,   knowing that our God is a consuming fire.        Let's take these one at a time and I will try to unfold them   from this text and elsewhere from Scripture and hopefully plant   your feet upon a Rock for your own encouragement and for your free   and abandoned service for Jesus Christ. I invite all believers in   this church to pray that there be an irresistible attraction to   the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these days so that every week at   least somebody passes over from death to life. Because there is a   shaking that's coming and I can't help but think that everybody   wants a place to stand and that everybody would see the   reasonableness that God Almighty, redeeming people through His Son   is the safest place in all the world to stand.        1. God has appointed a great final shaking of the earth that   will mean the end of the world as we know it and the beginning of   something infinitely better &#151; the consummation of His   Kingdom.        Look first at verses 26-27 of our text:        "God's voice then shook the earth (referring to the shaking at   Mount Sinai when He came to give the Law, Exodus 19:18); but now   He has promised (an allusion to Haggai&yuml;2:6), 'Yet once more I   will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.' (and then   comes the interpretation of this prophecy). This phrase, 'Yet once   more,' indicates the removal of what is shaken as of what has been   made, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain."        Now what you have here is a Biblical prophecy that there is   coming a day in which there will be such a violent shaking in   creation that the world as we know it will be removed. It will not   be anymore. There will come a new heaven and a new earth on which   righteousness dwells, but this world is going to come to a   cataclysmic end some day and there will be a removal of the world   as we know it and what cannot be shaken will remain. The Kingdom   of God and everyone who dwells in it.        There are several other places in the Bible where this is made   clear. For example,        Isaiah 13:13, "I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth   will be shaken out of its place, at the wrath of the Lord of hosts   in the day of his fierce anger."        So there's coming a day, the day of the Lord, of fierce anger   and retribution and justice upon the earth for its sin and the   earth will shaken out of its place.        Isaiah 24:18-20, "The foundations of the earth tremble. The   earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is   violently shaken. The earth staggers like a drunken man, it sways   like a hut; its transgression lies heavy upon it, and it falls,   and will not rise again."        There again a decisive prophecy that this world is going to   totter on its foundations someday and collapse as we know it; and   it will be over. And only GOD and His people will stand.        Revelation 6:12-17, "I looked and behold, there was a great   earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon   became like blood . . . The sky vanished like a scroll that is   rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its   place. Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the   generals and the rich and the strong, and every one, slave and   free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,   calling to the mountains and rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from   the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of   the Lamb; for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can   stand before it?'"        So there's a great earthquake coming when all the unbelievers   who have spurned the gospel, who have lived for worldly pleasures,   who have ignored God will want to be crushed under Nimitz rather   than face God.        Revelation 16:17-19, "A loud voice came out of the temple, from   the throne, saying, 'It is done!' And there were flashes of   lightning, voices, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such   as had never been since men were on the earth, so great was that   earthquake. The great city was split into three parts, and the   cities of the nations fell, and God remembered great Babylon, to   make her drain the cup of the fury of his wrath."        People who live in California joke about "the big one" that's   coming some day. There is a big one coming some day. It is bigger   than anyone can imagine. And my heart's desire as I have been   praying about this is that they would know how big "the big one"   that's coming really is. It is so vastly bigger than they realize   - or anybody realizes. Our imaginations cannot conceive of what it   will be like when the stars are falling, the skies are rolled up   like a scroll and the earth comes out of its foundations and   collapses and all the islands and the mountains vanish and there   is only God with whom to deal. I just hope and pray that any of   you who feel secure and safe outside Christ would tremble at this   thought. Because you're going to face God someday with nothing to   stand on but what was in your heart when the quake came!        2. Before this end comes, God has appointed that this great   final shaking be preceded by smaller earthquakes and other   calamities to give notice of something awesome, the way   contractions and labor pains precede the birth of a child and tell   us that it's coming.        This particular point is not found in our text from Hebrews.   It's found in Jesus' words to the disciples in   Matthew&yuml;24:7-8. The disciples ask Jesus what will be the sign   of his coming and the close of the age (v.&yuml;3). He answers in   verses 6ff.:        "You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not   alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For   nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and   there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: all this   is but the beginning of the birth-pangs."        Notice three things: 1)there is an end coming ("the end is not   yet"); 2)before it comes there will be wars, earthquakes and   famines; 3)these calamities before the end are called   "birth-pangs".        Calling the earthquakes and wars and famines birth-pangs is   important for two reasons. First, it means that there will be an   increasing frequency of these things as the end comes near and   that the intensity of them will increase, because that's the way   it happens with labor pains before a birth. Second, it means that   what these earthquakes are leading up to is something wonderful,   like the birth of a child. The labor may be painful, but it is   full of hope. They are the birth-pangs of the Kingdom. That's what   the meaning of increasing frequency of calamities will be as the   age draws to a close.        Should we not then hear in every rumor of war and every famine   and every earthquake first the voice of the Lord saying 'I reign!   And I am a God of holiness and justice and wrath and will not   condone sin.' And also hear in this great quaking, 'I am a God of   mercy, a God of hope, I am bringing in the Kingdom. I do not want   it to happen suddenly without warning. I have warned again and   again and again with shakings that should have broken you loose   from your love of the world.' That's what the meaning of this   earthquake is. Believe in God. Put your hand in Him.        Paul taught the same kind of thing in Romans 8:19-22,        "The creation.        (now by creation is meant all manner of inanimate objects,   geological plates under northern Calif.)        19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the   manifestation of the sons of God. 20 For the creature was made   subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath   subjected the same in hope, 21 Because the creature itself also   shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the   glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the   whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until   now.        (Now who is that? Satan? No! Satan subjects nothing to anything   in hope, only GOD is a God of hope. God subjected creation to   futility in hope so that when the curse came upon the world with   all of its manifold decaying and futility it was God bringing a   curse on the world for sin. But in hope)        If you ask, "Why should God ordain that there be an increasing   frequency and intensity of earthquakes toward the end of the age,   as the Lord draws near?" the Biblical answer seems to be that God   means to give hope-filled and shocking warnings before the Day of   the Lord the same way labor pains are hope-filled warnings that a   mother and father should get ready and go to a safe place to have   the baby. God means to give birth-pangs to the world so that the   world wakes up and knows something is about to happen. This is   mercy with all the tragedy that there is in all the calamities of   the world, its the loud, stark voice of a holy God saying 'Get   ready there is a shaking coming that will leave no house standing,   no building standing, no place to stand but the throne. That's the   meaning - it's warnings. And there will be an increasing number of   calamities so that there is growing a sense of unsettledness in   the world and people grasp and some hang onto money and some cling   to power and some go after the bottle and some go after sex and   some go after vacations and only a few have there love not grow   cold because lawlessness is multiplied. Those will be the ones who   hear the voice of the Lord in the shaking of our world in these   last days. Open your eyes to read the signs of the times so that   you not be taken off-guard when the calamity comes. Whether it's   your own little private calamity of a stopped heart or whether   everybody together rolls with the earthquake. It is coming and the   Lord is warning us that it is coming. Again and again and again He   is shaking people awake to the reality of the instability of this   world and the desirability of the unshakable Kingdom that He   offers.        3. Before the end of this age, God is giving to everyone who   believes in his Son a kingdom that cannot be shaken and will never   end.        This is the message of the whole Bible. But to see it we should   look at verse 28 of our text:        "Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that   cannot be shaken."        Notice: we have already received it. Verse 27 says that what   can be shaken will be swept away in one last great shaking, and   that what is unshakable will remain. Then verse 28 says that we   have already received that unshakable kingdom.        This is the great joy of being a Christian. It doesn't matter   whether you live Santa Cruz, California, or Charleston, South   Carolina, or on the banks of the Ganges in Bangladesh &#151; you   have a Kingdom which has already been given to you and your life   in Christ is unshakable. It does not mean there weren't any   Christians crushed under the Nimitz Freeway. There probably were.   Romans 8:23 says that "not only does the creation (the geological   plates beneath northern California) groan with birth-pangs, but we   ourselves who have the first fruits of the Holy Spirit groan   inwardly awaiting the adoption as Sons the redemption of our   bodies." We share in the futility and decay and calamities of   creation as long as we are in the body. When the flood comes we   may drown. When the hurricane comes we may lose our homes and   churches. When the earthquake strikes we may be under the   freeway.        No. Receiving an unshakable kingdom does not mean safety for   the body in this world. It does not mean that we'll escape the   earthquake. It means that "neither death, nor life, nor angels,   nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor   powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,   will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus   our Lord."        It means the deep and abiding certainty that "whether we live   or whether we die we are the Lord's .For to this end Christ died   and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the   living" (Romans 14:9). It means that "here we have no lasting   city, but we seek a city which is to come" (Hebrews 13:14): a city   whose builder and maker is God (Hebrews 11:10), a city that cannot   be shaken (Hebrews 12:28) &#151; for ever. It does not mean that   the judgment will not begin at the household of God. It will.        This brings us to our fourth and final point.        4. In view of all these things &#151; the free gift of an   unshakable Kingdom &#151; we should worship God with reverence and   awe, remembering that our God is a consuming fire.        Verse 28: "Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom   that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable   worship, with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming   fire."        The question for believer and unbeliever alike this morning is   this: are you worshiping the unshakable God or are you worshiping   shakable possessions? Is your heart fixed on God? Is God your   treasure or is the world your treasure? Is God your security or is   your retirement plan your security? Is God your fellowship or is   your family the sum total of your fellowship? Are you an idolator?   Is God your portion in this life, or is the world your portion? Do   you stand with reverence and awe before the power and holiness of   God, who is a consuming fire toward all sin and do you clothe   yourself with the asbestos righteousness of Jesus Christ so that   the fire of God can be seen from within as glory and not as   punishment?        I have a letter here that just came this week from Christians   in St. Croix after Hugo. The last paragraph says,        "Hugo has further reinforced in our minds the importance of   holding loosely to material things. In one night accumulated   wealth for which people had labored for many years, was turned   over to wind and rain, which were soon followed by . . . the   thieves.        One of the headlines in yesterday's paper said, "Marina   lifestyles crumble with the buildings."        Receive the Kingdom that cannot be shaken. Jesus said "Truly,   truly I say to you unless you receive the kingdom like a little   child you will never enter it." See how simple it is? What does 'a   little child' mean? It means you humbled yourself and recognize   that you can't make a place for yourself to stand. You can't cut   it in life and make the future what it needs to be. You just   humble yourself like a little child. Your recognize that there's a   Father in heaven. You see the gift offered through His Son Jesus   Christ&#151;forgiveness and the hope of everlasting life and a   firm kingdom that can't be shaken&#151;you extend your hands and   say 'sinner though I am I receive it. This is now my portion   forever and ever.'        Copyright 1989, 1998 John Piper      Piper's   Notes
