  September 25, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       STRENGTHENED TO SUFFER:    CHRIST, NOAH AND BAPTISM    (1 Peter 3:18-22)        For Christ also died for sins once forall, the just      for the unjust, in order that He might bring us to God, having      been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;      in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now      in prison, who once were disobedient, when the patience of God      kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of      the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought      safely through the water. And corresponding to that, baptism      now saves you -- not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an      appeal to God for a good conscience -- through the resurrection      of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone      into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been      subjected to Him.         To catch on to what this paragraph is all about we need to see   how it relates to what goes before and what comes after. Just   before in verse 17 Peter calls Christians to suffer if that is   God's will for them: "It is better, if God should will it so, that   you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is   wrong." Sometimes it is God's will that we suffer for doing what   is right. This is not an easy thing to hear. We need help with   this. We need understanding and we need encouragement and hope, if   God is going to will that we suffer for doing what is right.       So in verse 18 Peter begins this paragraph by saying, "For   Christ also died (suffered) for sins once for all . . ." The word   "for" shows us that Peter is beginning to explain why it is   sometimes God's will for us to suffer for doing what is right. So   the paragraph begins as an explanation or a reason for the call to   suffer as a Christian for doing what is right.       Then look at the connection between the paragraph and what   follows in 4:1. The next unit begins, "Therefore, since Christ has   suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same purpose" --   that is, the purpose to suffer for doing what is right, like   Christ did. So just before the text (in 3:17) and just after the   text (in 4:1) the point is: get ready to suffer for doing what it   right, if that should be God's will. Arm yourselves with that   purpose.       Between these two calls to suffer comes our text, verses 18-22.   So the main point of these verses is to help us get ready to   suffer with Jesus for doing what is right, not for doing what is   wrong. For all the puzzling things in these verses we must not   forget this main point -- Peter's intention in this text is to   help us arm ourselves with the faith to suffer for the sake of   Christ and his kingdom.       If that sounds irrelevant to you, it may be because you, like   most Americans, are insulated from the bigger world outside our   own little country (about 5% of total) and outside our own little   American era (about 5% of the last 6,000 years). For most of the   world and for most of history being a Christian has not been safe.   Stephen Neil says in his History of Christian Missions (p. 43)   that in the first three centuries, when the Church was spreading   like wildfire, "Every Christ knew that sooner or later he might   have to testify to his faith at the cost of his life."       Just think of it! Imagine doing evangelism in a context where   you could not make any promises to people that things would go   better for them on earth, but that if they believed what you   offered, they would be risking their lives. Does that say anything   to us about our evangelistic message and methods? That was normal   in the context of this letter, and in most of the places of the   world most of the time, including today.       But we have invented names for places where it's dangerous to   be a Christian. We call them "closed" countries. Which is odd   indeed. We have taken our false assumption that safety is normal,   and used that false assumption to define where the mission of the   church can advance. Peter and Paul would have found the whole idea   incomprehensible.       Today it is normal in most places to suffer for being   Christians. To be safe and respected is the exception, not the   rule. Just one example. Evangelical missionaries entered Cambodia   in the 1920s. By the time they were expelled in 1965 there were   about 600 believers. Between 1965 and 1975 during the civil war   the Christian population soared to an estimated 90,000. It was an   amazing work of God. But when the Khmer Rouge took control and Pol   Pot unleashed his fury on the nation, most of these Christians   died or fled the country.       This story can be retold hundreds of times over and over around   the world and along the centuries. It is normal not an abnormal   for Christians to be hated. Jesus said the most sweeping thing in   Matthew 24:9, "You will be hated by all nations on account of my   name." There is a warning here for us in America. I get the   impression that we are in a bitter, reactionary mood as Christians   in America. The atmosphere seems to be one of acrimony and rancor   and mean-spiritedness in the public square -- as if the liberal,   humanistic, secular, relativistic cultural elites have taken our   Christian world from us.       I think the time is right for a heavy dose of the teaching of 1   Peter -- as in 4:12. "Do not be surprised when the fiery ordeal   comes upon you as though something strange were happening to you."   Peter is laboring in this letter to say that we are aliens and   exiles here and that is NOT surprising, and not abnormal when the   cultural powers that be revile Christianity. "If they have called   the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his   house" (Matt. 10:25).       So in this text today -- and in the whole letter -- Peter is   laboring to help us be ready to suffer, if God should will it.   That is why verses 18-22 were written.       Let's look at five ways that Peter strengthens us for that   possibility.       1. First he insists that we not forget that Christ, our great   King and Savior suffered.       Verses 17-18: "It is better, if God should will it so, that you   suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is   wrong. FOR Christ also suffered." Throughout the New Testament the   mindset of Christianity is: our Lord suffered, we will follow him   in suffering.       You have Paul saying, "O that I might know him and the   fellowship of his sufferings and be conformed to his death" (Phil.   3:11). You have Hebrews saying, "He suffered outside the gate.   Hence let us go with him outside the camp bearing his reproach"   (13:12-13). You have Jesus saying, "If anyone would come after me,   let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" (Mk.   8:34). I bear the cross; you will bear the cross.       The first great encouragement to prepare ourselves for   suffering for doing what is right is that this is what happened to   Jesus the greatest, most loving, caring, truthful, holy man that   ever lived.       2. Peter strengthens us to suffer by telling us that Christ has   triumphed over our greatest enemy and brought us safe to God.       Someone might ask, "Why would anyone become a Christian if what   you could offer them was that things in this world would probably   go worse for them and that their lives would be at risk. The   answer is that the greatest human needs are not to live long on   the earth and be comfortable. The biggest human needs are how to   have our sins forgiven and overcome our separation from God and   live for ever with happiness in his presence instead of living   forever in misery in hell. That's ten thousand times more   important than living long on the earth and being comfortable for   a zillionth percentage of your existence.       This is what the death of Jesus accomplishes. Verse 18: "For   Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust,   in order that He might bring us to God." Notice four things.       A) Christ died "for sins". This is what separates me from God.   This is my biggest need. These are my biggest enemy -- not Satan.   Isaiah 59:2, "Your iniquities have made a separation between you   and your God." This is vastly more terrifying than suffering for   righteousness' sake -- suffering the wrath of God because my sins   have not been forgiven. But Jesus died "for sins." This is the   greatest thing in the world. I do not have to die in my sins.   There is forgiveness. This is why people would believe on Jesus   even if it cost them there lives.       B) Christ died "the just for the unjust." His death was   substitutionary. He took my place. He stood under the wrath and   penalty that I deserved and bore it for me. His death was utterly   innocent. It was all for others sins, and not his own.       C) Christ died "once for all" -- that is, his death was final   and all-sufficient to accomplish the forgiveness of all who   believe on him. He does not have to ever offer another sacrifice.   It was finished. It was all that was necessary to take away the   guilt of my sins. The debt is paid in full.       D) All of this brings me to God. "Christ also died for sins   once for all, the just for the unjust, in order that he might   bring us to God."       This is the great comfort of martyrs and suffering Christians.   Our worst enemy -- sin -- has been defeated. And Jesus has made   sure that we will be at home safe with God. He has brought us to   God. The separation has been removed. God is near us, and he is   for us. Our lives are hid in him.       How does this help us to suffer? Because one of the terrible   temptations of the devil in suffering is to make us think that God   has forsaken us. What he is saying here is: Suffering is no sign   that God has forsaken us and turned against us! Christ has carried   our sin, absorbed the wrath of God, and brought us safe to God.       3. The third way that Peter strengthens us for suffering is   with the situation in Noah's day.       After referring to Jesus being made alive in the spirit (v.   18), verse 19-20 says,       "In which (i.e., in the spirit) also He &#91;Jesus&#93; went   and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, 20) who once   were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the   days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few,   that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water."       There is a lot of controversy over what this refers to. I'll   tell you what I think and how it relates to the main point. I   think it refers to the time when people in Noah's day were   disobedient, mocking him as a righteous man obeying God (like the   situation in the lives of Peter's readers), and that Jesus, in the   spirit, was sent by God in those days to preach to those people   through Noah.       Just like in 1:11 the Spirit of Jesus was in the Old Testament   prophets predicting his coming, so the Spirit of Jesus was in Noah   preaching to the disobedient people of Noah's day. They are NOW in   prison -- that is, in a place of torment awaiting the final   judgment (Luke 16:24). I don't take this verse to refer to Jesus'   going to the place of the dead and preaching to the spirits there   -- though many wise and good people take it that way. One main   reason is this: if Peter's point is that Jesus went to preach to   all the dead, why would he say, that they were once disobedient on   the days of Noah. There were thousands and millions of spirits   there who had not lived in the days of Noah.       So I take it mean that Jesus went to preach in the days of Noah   to people who, because they rejected that preaching, are NOW in   prison awaiting final judgment.       There are three ways that this strengthens us for suffering.       One is that it assures of the greatness of Christ. He is not   bound by space and time. He was there preaching thousands of years   before and he is here speaking today. He will be with you, as he   said, to the end of the age -- in China and Guinea and Congo and   Bangkok and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and Japan and Papua New   Guinea and Siberia and the Philippines and Ivory Coast and Austria   and Cyprus and Germany and Minneapolis -- wherever you may suffer,   both now and for ever.       Second, it is better to obey him and suffer than to disobey and   be cast into the prison of verse 19. That is what happened to the   spirits in Noah's day. They thought it was foolish to heed the   call of God like Noah did. So they staid comfortable and   respectable until the rain started. This is again why people can   be converted with a message that calls for suffering -- it is a   suffering that will keep them out of eternal prison.       Third, it is no disadvantage to you to be a small rejected   minority. That's the point in verse 20 where it says that in the   ark "a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through   the water." It must have felt foolish to be such a small minority.   But the point is: if you are a minority with God, you will be   saved and the tables will be turned. So when the suffering comes,   don't throw away your confidence that has great reward.       4. The fourth way that Peter strengthens us for suffering is by   describing the meaning of baptism.       The flood waters that brought judgment on the world in Noah's   reminds Peter of Christian baptism. Verse 21: "And corresponding   to that &#91;the flood&#93;, baptism now saves you-- not the   removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good   conscience -- through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."       Verse 18 said that Christ died for sins and brought us to God.   In other words Christ saves us. But the question is: who is us?   Whom does Christ's death actually save? That's what verse 21   answers: those who are baptized. But Peter knows that this will be   misunderstood if he does not qualify it. So when he says, "Baptism   now saves you," he adds, "Not the removal of dirt from the flesh,   but an appeal to God for a good conscience." This is virtually a   definition of baptism. Baptism is an outward expression of a   spiritual, inward appeal to God for cleansing. In other words,   baptism is a way of saying to God: "I trust you to apply the death   of Jesus to me for my sins and to bring me through death and   judgment into new and everlasting life through the resurrection of   Jesus."       Baptism may cleanse the body because it was by immersion. But   that is not why he says it saves. It saves for one reason: it is   an expression of faith. It is an appeal of faith. Paul said in   Romans 10:13 that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be   saved. Baptism is such a calling. It is an appeal to the Lord.       How does this strengthen us for suffering with Christ?       Like this: When we have come through the water of baptism we   have passed through death and judgment. We have been buried with   Christ and we have risen with him. We have passed from death to   life. Judgment is past. The suffering we are experiencing cannot   be the condemnation of God. That has already been experienced for   us by Christ. We have received that by faith and we have expressed   our faith by baptism. It stands as a constant reminder that the   worst suffering has been averted. Christ took it for us. We will   never have to come into judgment. There is now no condemnation. We   have already died that death in Christ and been raised in him.   Therefore our present suffering is not the wrath of God but the   loving discipline of our Father and the preparation for glory.       5. One last way Peter strengthens us for suffering: he shows us   that Christ is now at the right hand of God ruling over all   angels, authorities and powers.       Verse 22: "He is at the right hand of God, having gone into   heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected   to Him."       Take this one thought with you in preparation for your   suffering. No harassing, oppressing, deceiving, accusing demon is   free to do as he pleases. All angels, authorities, powers, devils,   evil spirits, demons and Satan himself are subject to Jesus   Christ.       When Peter says at the end of his letter (5:9), that the devil   prowls around like a lion seeking to devour, resist him firm in   your faith, THIS is the faith he has in mind. The faith that all   angels, authorities and powers are subject to Jesus. This is what   we rebuke and resist the devil with: you are subject to Jesus.   Jesus reigns at God's right hand and you are under him. You can do   nothing without his permission. You are a cat on a chain. You   cannot touch me unless he lets you. And he will only let you to   the degree that your touch will turn for my good and for his   glory.       So stand firm believers. Stand firm in this great faith, and   arm yourselves with the purpose of Christ. The Son of Man came not   to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for   many. Let's follow him.       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
