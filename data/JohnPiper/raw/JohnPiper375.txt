 February 28, 1993    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       PRESERVING THE COVENANT COMMUNITY    IN SPITE OF SICKNESS AND SIN       (James 5:16-20)        Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and      pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective      prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. Elijah was a man      with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might      not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and      six months. And he prayed again, and the sky poured rain, and      the earth produced its fruit. My brethren, if any among you      strays from the truth, and one turns him back, let him know      that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save      his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.         
       What this texts makes clear is that sickness and sin happen in   the new covenant community. Some day that will not be true (Rev.   21:3-4). But for now in this fallen age of futility and groaning   and waiting, it is true. Belonging to the covenant community does   not mean guaranteed health or guaranteed sinlessness now.       So the question rises: How do you preserve the covenant   community in spite of sickness and sin? That's what this text is   about. And that's what the fourth paragraph of our Church Covenant   is about.       (4) We further engage to watch over one another in      brotherly love; to remember one another in prayer; to aid one      another in sickness and distress; to cultivate Christian      sympathy in feeling, and courtesy in speech; to be slow to take      offense, but always ready for reconciliation and mindful of the      rules of our Savior to secure it without delay.        What I want to focus on today is the preserving of the covenant   community in spite of sin. We have talked a good bit about praying   for each other in our sickness, and I don't want to minimize the   importance of that. I want us to grow in our faith and our   commitment to pray for the sick and see God do mighty things for   the sick. He is not disinterested in our bodies. But with the   limited time I have this morning I think I should focus this time   not on verses 16-18, but on the last two verses of our text (James   5:19-20), and the issue of sin in the community.       What I see here are four crucial things about preserving the   covenant community in spite of sin. I'll treat them under these   headings:       1. Covenant truth.       2. Covenant vulnerability.       3. Covenant warnings.       4. Covenant security.         Covenant truth         The point here is simply (and yet profoundly and   controversially) that there is truth. And since there is truth,   there is error. And since there is truth and error, there is a way   to walk that is called sin, namely, to walk out of sync with the   truth, and in sync with error.        My brethren, if any among you strays from the      truth, and one turns him back, let him know that he who turns a      sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death,      and will cover a multitude of sins.         Notice the four key words. In verse 19 a person is straying   from the TRUTH. Then in verse 20 this person is called a SINNER,   his sin is called ERROR, and this is described as his WAY. "...he   who turns a sinner from the error of his way..." So there is   truth. And there is a way to live that is out of sync with that   truth. And that way is error and sin.       This is the foundation of our church covenant. It exists   because we endorse this notion that there is truth and there is   error. There is sin and there is righteousness. There is good and   there is bad. There is right and there is wrong. Our church exists   because we have affirmed a covenant with God and with each other   to walk according to truth. To turn from error. To forsake sin.       I stress this because the most destructive force against   Christianity today is, I think, the pervasive attack against the   notion of truth in contemporary culture. In other words, the main   battle today is not being fought between those who say that the   Bible is true and those who say that the Bible is false. The main   battle is over whether there is such a thing as true and false.   Whether these notions are bourgeois ideas left over from   unenlightened culturally myopic times.       Let me describe two ways that this attack is being carried on.       One goes like this. Modern secularists say that technology and   science have shown that the Bible is irrelevant at best. It is   part of ancient superstitions on a par with the Greek gods of Zeus   and Hermes and Poseidon, or the animistic belief that rivers have   spirits. So the claim that the Bible has unique authority is   relativized. Its claim to universal truth won't stand the test of   the modern scientific world view.       One response to this in the last 100 years in America has been   to keep the Bible at the center of our cultural life by arguing   that, whether true or not, the Bible is crucial for understanding   Western Culture. So up until maybe 30 or 40 years ago one could   make a case for taking the Bible seriously because the university   and high school curricula all assumed the indispensable, unifying   value of western culture--centuries of art and literature and   philosophy and moral tradition flowing from the Biblical world   through the middle ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and   the Modern industrial age, and shaping who we are in the modern   western world.       But in the last 30 years or so along side scientific secularism   there has arisen a radical multi-culturalism that says, in effect,   "What's so special about this Western Culture?" It has no more   claim to privilege than any other culture. So this secondary   effort to defend the unique worth of the Bible as the foundation   of western culture is collapsing today as the multi-culturalists   deconstruct any claim at all that one culture or tradition is   better than another.       That's one way that the truth claim of the Bible is being   undermined. Another way is this: those who oppose the concept of   truth say with increasing frequency that all claims to truth have   been and are now politically driven, and should be rejected, not   because they are false, but because they are oppressive. In other   words, truth is not what its defenders say it is. But rather it's   a political weapon by which men oppress women, and whites oppress   blacks and western culture oppresses eastern culture, and the rich   oppress the poor, and Christians oppress Muslims, and straight   people oppress homosexuals, and so on.       So the way that the claim to truth is attacked is not by   showing that it's false or distorted, but by calling it names:   chauvinistic or bigoted or parochial or racist or intolerant or   homophobic. And of course there is enough misuse of truth to give   some credibility to the attack. But the tragedy today is that   thousands of power-brokers in our country endorse the attack   uncritically without seeing that the very foundations of civilized   life and beauty and goodness and justice and love are being swept   away by this derision of the concept of truth.       I dwell on this because I think nothing is undermining Biblical   Christianity today more than this attack on the existence of   truth. If we yield to this attack we are saying that the Bible is   no more true and valuable than the Communist Manifesto, or   Hammurabi's Code, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or the Buddhist sutras, or   the Koran, or the sayings of Confucius or an animist chant.       That is a high price to pay to be up-to-date and in step with   the times. I want you to hear the first point of this message in   very conscious distinction to this contemporary trend. There is   truth. It is rooted in God, and revealed through The Bible. And   there is a way to live that accords with this truth. We exist as a   church on this foundation. And our church covenant is a   declaration that we will not yield to the pressures of an   all-destroying relativism. It is a pledge to each other to live   according to the truth.         Covenant vulnerability         The point here is simply that Christians living in the new   covenant and committed to each other by a church covenant can and   do sin. We are vulnerable to sinning. We are not yet perfect.   Verse 19: "My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth . .   ." It is possible to stray.       What then becomes of the new covenant promises that God will   write the law on our hearts (Jer. 31:33) and that he will put his   Spirit within us and cause us to walk in his statutes (Ezek.   36:27) and that he will work in us that which is pleasing in his   sight (Heb. 13:21)?       The answer is that God does not transform his people overnight.   He could. And we often wish he would. But for reasons known better   to him than to us he allows us often to stumble in our own   remaining rebellion and corruption--probably to show us how   utterly corrupt we are without him and to make us desperate for   him.       The new covenant promise is that God will change us. His Spirit   does dwell within. He is the Sanctifier. All true virtue is his   fruit not ours. But he does not do it overnight. And so we remain   vulnerable to sinning. And we must not become presumptuous or   proud, but constantly pray for more grace and give ourselves to   the fight of faith (1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7) and the pursuit of   holiness (Heb. 12:14).         Covenant warnings         What we need to see here is sobering. The covenant warning here   is that the path of sin can lead to death without a covering for   sin. In other words, it leads to destruction and eternal lostness   in hell. Verse 20:       He who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his   soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.       If the sinner turns back from his slide into sin he will escape   death and will be in a relationship with Christ that covers all   his sins. But if he does not turn back, then he will die, and his   sins will not be covered. He will perish forever.       This is utterly crucial to see. The New Testament writers do   not assume that everyone in the church is necessarily going to   persevere to the end and be saved. They treat people who have made   a profession of faith as true members of the covenant community,   giving them the benefit of the doubt. James calls them all   "brothers" in verse 19. "My brethren, if any among you strays from   the truth . . ."       But he does not assume that every one whom he calls a brother   is in fact a brother. And so he warns the whole church that   straying away from the faith into persistent sin will lead to   death without forgiveness. The final proof of who is a brother and   who is not is perseverance of faith, not profession of faith.       James assumes exactly what John assumes in 1 John 2:19. Some   people had left the faith and the church without being persuaded   to turn back. John said,       They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if   they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they   went out, in order that it might be shown that they all are not of   us.       So John and James recognize that not everyone who says, "Lord,   Lord," will enter the kingdom (Matt. 7:21). Therefore even in the   new covenant community--like Bethlehem--we must warn each other   about the tremendous danger and deceitfulness of sin, and how it   can become so attractive that it pulls a person beyond the point   of no return. This is the covenant warning that we need from each   other again and again.       There are far too many who play with sin and presume upon   grace, and do not realize that they can make shipwreck of their   lives and die without forgiveness, even though they claimed to be   Christians and belonged outwardly to a new covenant community.         Covenant security         Or I prefer to call it the community project of new covenant   security. Our security in the new covenant rests in God's keeping   power. "He who began a good work in you will complete it until the   day of Christ" (Phil. 1:6). "He will sustain you to the end,   guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 1:8). "He   is able to keep you from falling and to present you without   blemish before the presence of his glory" (Jude 24). "Those whom   he justified he also glorified" (Rom. 8:30; cf. 1 Thess. 5:23-5).       Our security is in God. Our security is the new covenant   commitment of God to produce in us the faith and the obedience and   perseverance we need to endure to the end and be saved. That is   our security.       But what James makes clear is that God does his preserving work   through human means. Look at the wording of verse 20 once more:        Let him know that he who turns a sinner from the      error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover      a multitude of sins.         What's the subject of the verb, "will save"? Who is the saver   in this verse? It's the church member who goes after the straying   brother. "He who turns a sinner from the error of his way will   save him." It's like Paul saying, "I became all things to all men   that I might by all means save some" (1 Cor. 9:22).       Eternal security is certain for God's elect. But eternal   security is a community project. When a fish is caught did the   hook catch it, or the bait, or the line, or the pole, or the   fisherman, or the current in the sea that led the fish to the   vicinity, or the boss back home that told the man to take the day   off and go fishing. The answer is: all of the above.       And so it is in the new covenant community. Covenant security   is not a mechanical automatic thing. It depends on God, and God   uses means; so it depends on means--like going after each other   when we are straying into sin.       Paul showed the combination of God's sovereign saving power and   his use of human means in 2 Timothy 2:24-26:        And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly   to every one, an apt teacher, forbearing, correcting his opponents   with gentleness.  &#91;That's God's means. But here is God's   sovereign prerogative:&#93;  God may perhaps grant that they   will repent and come to know the truth, and they may escape from   the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his   will.        God uses means to keep us secure. And the measure of our   security and our joy in this church will be the degree to which we   use the means of grace to turn each other back from straying and   keep each other safe in the love of God that covers the multitude   of our sins.
