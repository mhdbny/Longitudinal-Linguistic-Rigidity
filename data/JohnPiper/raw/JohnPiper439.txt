    April 30, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Love Your Neighbor as You LoveYourself (Part One)   (Matthew 22:34-40)          


 But when the Phariseesheard that He had put the    Sadducees to silence, they gathered themselves together. And oneof them, a lawyer, asked    Him a question, testing Him, Teacher, which is thegreatest commandment in the    Law?      


 And He said to him, &#145;You shalllove the Lord your God with    all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.This is the great and    foremost commandment. The second is like it, &#145;You shalllove your neighbor as    yourself.&#146; On these two commandments depend the whole Lawand the Prophets.              The Incredible Context of This Commandment     My main concern in this text is thecommandment: You shall  love your neighbor as yourself. But it is surrounded by suchstupendous statements  we would be foolhardy to plunge into it without pondering thesesurroundings. So it is  going to take us two weeks at least to deal with this text.     The two stupendous things I have in mind are,first, the greatest  commandment in the Word of God. In verse 36 a Pharisee asks Jesus,Teacher, which is  the great commandment in the Law? Jesus answers by quotingDeuteronomy 6:5,           You shall love the Lord your God with allyour heart, and with all    your soul, and with all your mind.        Then he adds his own words to put thecommandment even higher than the  question required. The question was, Which is the greatcommandment? and Jesus  says, This is the great and foremost commandment.     So the first stupendous thing surrounding thecommandment to love your  neighbor as you love yourself is the commandment to love God asthe greatest and foremost  thing that is in the entire word of God. The greatest and mostimportant thing you can do  is love God --  love GOD  -- with all your heart and soul andmind.    The other stupendous thing surrounding thecommand to love your  neighbor as you love yourself is what follows in verse 40,     On these two commandments depend the wholeLaw and the Prophets.     Everything else in the Old Testament in somesense depends on these two  commandments: the commandment to love God and the commandment tolove our neighbor. This  is an amazing statement. We have the authority of the Son of Godhere telling us something  utterly stupendous about the origin and design of the entire planand Word of God.    Now those are the two stupendous things we needto ponder before we  dive into the overwhelming commandment to love our neighbor as welove ourselves. I say it  is overwhelming because it seems to demand that I tear the skinoff my body and wrap it  around another person so that I feel that I am that other person;and all the longings  that I have for my own safety and health and success and happinessI now feel for that  other person as though he were me.     It is an absolutely staggering commandment. Ifthis is what it means,  then something unbelievably powerful and earthshaking andreconstructing and overturning  and upending will have to happen in our souls. Somethingsupernatural. Something well  beyond what self-preserving, self-enhancing, self-exalting, self-esteeming, self-advancing  human beings like John Piper can do on their own.    Before we take up such a commandment and applyit to our lives, we need  to ponder these two stupendous things that surround thecommandment. That the commandment  to love God is the great and foremost commandment in the Word ofGod and that all the Law  and the Prophets depend on these two commandments.    Let&#146;s start with verse 40. On thesetwo commandments depend  the whole Law and the Prophets. First, consider the sheerfact that  Jesus said  this . He didn&#146;t have to say it. The Pharisee didn&#146;task this. Jesus went  beyond what he asked and said more. He seems to want to push theimportance and centrality  of these commandments as much as he can. He has said that thecommandment to love God is  great and foremost. He has said the commandment to love yourneighbor as you love yourself  is like it. Verse 39: The second is  like it . . .  That&#146;s enough to raise the stakes here almost as high as theycan be raised. We have  the greatest commandment in all the revelation of God to humanity(Love God); and we have  the second greatest, which is like the greatest (Love yourneighbor).    But Jesus doesn&#146;t stop there. He wants usto be stunned at how  important these two commandments are. He wants us to stop andwonder. He wants us to spend  more than a passing moment on these things. More than a week ortwo of preaching. So he  adds, On these two commandments depend the whole Law and theProphets. They  are 1) the first and the greatest, and 2) the second that is likethe first and the  greatest. But they are also the two commandments on whicheverything else in the Bible  depends. On these two commandments depend the whole Law andthe Prophets.    Now what does this mean? Let me see if I canopen a window into heaven  by contrasting what Jesus says here (in v. 40) with what he saysin Matthew 7:12 and what  Paul says in Romans 13. Turn with me to the Sermon on the Mount inMatthew 7:12. This  verse is better known as the Golden Rule. It is, I think, a goodcommentary on Love  your neighbor as you love yourself.     Matthew 7:12: This Is the Law and theProphets     Jesus has just said that God will give usgood things if we ask and  seek and knock, because he is a loving Father. Then in Matthew7:12 he says,           Therefore, however you want people totreat you, so treat them, for    this is the Law and the Prophets.        Notice that again Jesus refers to the Law andthe Prophets like he did  in Matthew 22:40. He says, if you do to others what you would havethem do to you, then  this is the Law and the Prophets. In Matthew 22:40 hesaid, On these two  commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.    Take notice here that the first commandment isnot mentioned in Matthew  7:12. Loving God with all your heart is not mentioned. Treatingothers the way we would  like to be treated, he says,   is   the Law andthe Prophets.     We must be careful here. Some people over thecenturies have tried to  take sentences like the Golden Rule and say that Jesus was mainlya profound teacher of  human ethics; and that what he taught is not dependent on God orany relationship with  God. They say, See, he can sum up the whole Old Testament,the Law and the Prophets,  in practical human relationships: the Golden Rule.     I say we must be careful here, because thinkinglike that not only  ignores the great things Jesus said about God elsewhere and theamazing things he said  about himself coming from God to give his life a ransom for many(Mark 10:45), it also  ignores the immediate context. Verse 12 begins withtherefore (dropped in the  NIV):      Therefore , however you wantpeople to treat you, sotreat them.       What this shows is that the Golden Rule dependson what went before --  on our relationship to God as our Father who loves us and answersour prayers and gives us  good things when we ask him (Matthew 7:9-11). In fact this is avery profound key to how  we are able to love our neighbor as we love ourselves. So God ishere upholding the Golden  Rule by his fatherly provision. His love for us and our trusting,prayerful love back to  him is the source of power for living the Golden Rule. So youcan&#146;t turn Jesus into a  mere teacher of ethics.    But still, Jesus does say that treating othersas you want to be  treated is the law and the prophets. He does not saythat loving God is  the Law and the Prophets. Why does he say it in this way? Ithink what he means is  that when you see people love like that (fulfill the Golden Rule),what your are seeing is  the visible expression of the Law and the Prophets. This behavioramong people manifests  openly and publicly and practically what the Old Testament isabout. It fulfills the Law  and the Prophets. Loving God is invisible. It is an internalpassion of the soul. But it  comes to expression when you love others. So loving others is theoutward manifestation,  the visible expression, the practical demonstration, and thereforethe fulfillment of what  the Old Testament is about. So there is a sense in which thesecond commandment (to love  your neighbor) is the visible goal of the whole Word of God.It&#146;s not as though  loving God is not here, or that loving God is less important;rather loving God is made  visible and manifest and full in our visibly, practically,sacrificially loving others. I  think that is why the second commandment stands by itself when theNew Testament says that  love fulfills the law.     Romans 13:8-10: He Who Loves His Neighborhas Fulfilled the Law     Let&#146;s look at one other text thatpoints in this direction.    Look at Romans 13:8-10.           Owe nothing to anyone except to love oneanother; for he who loves    his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 9 For this, &#145;You shallnot commit adultery, you    shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall notcovet,&#146; and if there is any    other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, &#145;Youshall love your neighbor as    yourself.&#146; 10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; lovetherefore is the fulfillment of    the law.        Two times (vv. 8,10) Paul says that the commandto love our neighbor is  the fulfillment of the law. This is what Jesus meantwhen he said (in Matt.  7:12) that treating others as you would like to be treatedis the law and the  prophets. And, just as in Matthew 7:12, Paul doesn&#146;tsay that the law is  fulfilled in loving God and loving neighbors. He only says that ifyou love your neighbor  you fill up the law. I think this means the same as Matthew 7:12,Loving our neighbor as  we love ourselves is the visible expression and manifestation andpractical completion and  fulfillment of all that the Old Testament was about, includinglove for God. Love for God  comes to visible manifestation when we love others. Or you couldsay, our love for God is  fulfilled when we love others.    We know Paul saw this practical love as utterlydependent on our  relationship to God. In Romans 8:3-4 he says,          For what the Law could not do, weak as it wasthrough the flesh, God  did:     sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering  for sin,    He condemned sin in the flesh, 4  in order that therequirement of the Law might be    fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh  (=self reliance) , but    according to the Spirit  (= God-reliance).       In other words, fulfilling the law -- lovingour neighbor as we love  ourselves is not something we can do on our own. We do it by theHoly Spirit. And we saw  last week that Paul teaches God supplies the Spirit to us throughfaith.    So it&#146;s the same as in Matthew 7:12. WhenJesus and Paul say that  loving our neighbor as we love ourselves is the fulfillment of theOld Testament, they  don&#146;t exclude our love for God and his love for us; theyassume it.     Matthew 22:37-40: On These Two Commandments Hang ...     But let&#146;s go back to our text inMatthew 22:37-40. Here Jesus  DOES mention both love for God and love for neighbor; and heexplicitly says (in v. 40),  On these two commandments depend the whole Law and theProphets. Why? I want  to suggest that he is saying something different here than inthose other texts (Matt.  7:12; Rom. 13:8,10). Here he does not say that these twocommandments fulfill  the Law and the Prophets, or that they are the Law andthe Prophets. He says  that the Law and the Prophets   depend   on these twocommandments. Verse 40:      On these two commandments  depend the whole Law and the  Prophets.     Now this is a window into heaven, if you haveeyes to see. When he says  here that the Law and the Prophets   depend  (literally: hang like  a stone around the neck, or a snake on the hand, or a man on across) on love, this is the  reverse of what those other texts were saying. They were sayingthat the Law and Prophets  lead to and find expression and fulfillment in love. But here inMatthew 22:40 Jesus is  saying the reverse: love leads to and finds expression in the Lawand the Prophets. The  Law and the Prophets are hanging on -- depending on -- somethingbefore them, namely,  God&#146;s passion that this world, this history of humankind, bea world of love to God  and radical, other-oriented love to each other.     Illustration     Let me see if I can put this in a picture,so that you can see it  more plainly. It is so important, if we are going to grasp themagnitude of the  significance of love in our midst, as we move forward into thepractical expressions of it  in our preaching and in our life together at Bethlehem.    Let&#146;s picture the inspired history ofredemption from creation to  consummation as a scroll like the one John saw in Revelation 5.This is the Law and the  Prophets (and the New Testament). The story of God&#146;s acts andpurposes in history are  told in this scroll, along with God&#146;s commandments andpromises. Matthew 7:12 and  Romans 13:8-10 tell us that, when the people of God love theirneighbor as they love  themselves, the purpose of this scroll is being fulfilled.It&#146;s aim is being  expressed visibly, manifested practically so that people cansee our good deeds and  give glory to our Father in heaven (Matt. 5:16). So thescroll is leading to love.  Love is flowing from the scroll.    But then Jesus gives us an incredibleperspective. He lifts us out of  history and out of the world for a moment and shows us the scrollfrom a distance. Now we  can see it whole -- the Law and the Prophets, the Old Testament,the story of redemption,  the purposes and acts of God in history. And what we see is thatthe scroll is hanging by  two golden chains, one fastened to each end of the scroll handles.And Jesus lifts our  eyes to heaven, and we see the chains run up and disappear intoheaven.     Then he takes us up to heaven. And he shows usthe ends of the chains.  They are fastened to the throne of God. One chain is fastened tothe right arm of the  throne where the words are inscribed: You shall love theLord your God with all your  heart, and all your soul, and all your mind. And the otherchain is fastened to the  left arm of the throne where the words are inscribed, Youshall love your neighbor  as yourself.     And Jesus turns to us and says, The wholescroll, the whole Law  and the Prophets, the whole history of redemption and all myFather&#146;s plans and acts  hang on these two great sovereign purposes of God -- that he beloved by his people, and  that his people love each other.    I believe it would not be too much to say thatall of creation, all of  redemption, all of history hang on these two great purposes --that humans love God with  all our heart, and that from the overflow of that love we loveeach other.    Which means that love is the origin (Matt.22:40) and the goal (Rom.  13:8,10) of the Law and the Prophets. It is the beginning and theend of why God inspired  the Bible. It&#146;s the fountainhead and spring at the one end,and the shoreless ocean  at the other end of the river of redemptive history -- rememberedand promised in the Word  of God.    God&#146;s word for us this morning is that wetake with tremendous  seriousness this season of dealing with love at Bethlehem. That welet this picture stun  us and remake our priorities. That we get alone with him and dealwith him about these  things. That we not assume that we fully know what love is or thatit has the proper  centrality in our lives. He is saying: All of Scripture, all ofhis plans for history,  hang --  HANG  -- on these two great purposes: that he beloved with all our heart,  and that we love each other as we love ourselves.
