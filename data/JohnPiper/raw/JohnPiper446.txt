    August 20, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE HAPPIEST DAYS OFHEAVEN     Second in a Series on Luke 15   (Luke 15:1-10)               Now all the tax-gatherers and the sinnerswere coming near Him to    listen to Him. And both the Pharisees and the scribes began  to grumble,    saying, This man receives sinners and eats withthem. And He told them this    parable, saying, What man among you, if he has a hundredsheep and has lost one of    them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture, and goafter the one which is    lost, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it onhis shoulders, rejoicing.    And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and hisneighbors, saying to them,    'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' Itell you that in the same    way, there will be  more  joy in heaven over onesinner who repents, than    over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. Orwhat woman, if she has ten    silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweepthe house and search    carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, shecalls together her friends    and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found thecoin which I had lost!' In    the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of theangels of God over one    sinner who repents.                Introduction: A Barnes and Noble World     We live in a world that is immenselydifferent from the world of  John Bunyan 300 years ago and George Whitefield 200 years ago andDwight L. Moody 100  years ago. One of the differences hit me this week when I wentwith Abraham to the Barnes  and Noble Bookstore downtown. Have you been to a major diversifiedbook retailer recently?  It&#146;s mind-boggling. It captures in the space of a half a cityblock the overwhelming,  uncontrollable, ever-expanding diversity of our culture. Everytopic, every science, every  hobby, every vocation, every sport, every philosophy, everyreligion you can think of is  represented -- most of them not just with a book or two, but withwhole sections of books.  And what makes the diversity feel aggressive and assertive is thatall the thousands of  viewpoints and philosophies and worldviews and religions arepackaged in slick, colorful,  attractive, professional covers. This gives the feel that there isa powerful industry and  movement behind almost every one of the 50,000 ideas competing foryour attention and  allegiance.     I thought to myself: this is the world where westand up -- or not --  and proclaim the supremacy of Christ. Bunyan and Whitefield andMoody struggled to make  Christ known in a much less complex, less pluralistic, lessdiverse atmosphere. Today the  alternatives to Jesus as the Way the Truth and the Life are manynot few, near not far,  aggressive not passive, and handsome instead of homely. They areaggressively marketed.  And if you don&#146;t read, they&#146;re on tape and you can use aheadphone to try them  out.    We need to be aware of this. And we need totest our faith in the face  of it. Do we really believe in the uniqueness and supremacy ofJesus Christ? Or did we  just fall into this religious option by tradition or family orsocial pressure? Our  situation is more like the apostle Paul&#146;s in Athens andEphesus and Rome than it is  like Bunyan&#146;s and Whitefield&#146;s and Moody&#146;s. When hecame to those cities  they were filled with competing idols (Acts 17:6), and religionsand magic arts and  witchcraft and sorcery and philosophies were as diverse as thecaravans that made their  way from east to west.    We need to remember that into this situation ofincredible diversity  and pluralism Paul spoke a bold, uncompromising, strong, lovingword: God was in  Christ reconciling the world to himself (2 Cor. 5:19). Thisis the heart of our  Christian faith. Then and now: God -- singular, one and only,Creator of all, and  Sustainer of all -- was in Christ. When you see Christ, you seeGod. When you hear Christ,  you hear God, your Creator. Jesus said to his disciple Philip,He who has seen Me  has seen the Father (John 14:9).     We need to see Jesus today in this way. He isspeaking this morning  into the world of Barnes and Noble bookstores -- the world we livein. He is eating with  tax-gatherers and sinners and the religious leaders of his day aregrumbling and accusing.  Verse two: This man receives sinners and eats withthem. In effect they are  challenging Jesus to give an account of himself. Why do you actthis way? Who do you think  you are? Tell us what this means.     An Incredible Claim and Two Responses     The answer they get is spectacular. Ifit&#146;s true, he may as  well have set off an atomic bomb. Don&#146;t miss the astonishingforce of this answer.  Here is a Jewish village somewhere in Palestine. It&#146;s lunchtime, perhaps. Jesus is  in a house eating and he has welcomed some tax-gatherers and otherunsavory types.  Pharisees are standing near the walls. They grumble amongthemselves. Jesus hears and  answers with a couple parables.    So it&#146;s no big deal, right? I meanit&#146;s just a lunch. A few  pious people who can&#146;t agree with each other. A religioussquabble. A few stories.  While far away in China some great war is taking place perhapsthat holds the fate of  millions.    But then you listen more carefully to these twolittle stories. And  suddenly, or gradually, it dawns on you. This man -- this Jesus --is saying, that the God  of heaven -- the God before whom all the angels bow down inworship -- is, right now in  this very lunch around this very table in these very words, inthis very man, reaching  into the lives of individual tax-gatherers and sinners, bringingthem to repentance,  welcoming them into his own possession, and leading all of heavento rejoice.    And your mind and heart awakens to that, yourealize that a battle  anywhere in China or South America or Britain is as nothingcompared to what is being  revealed here. Here is a man claiming that the habitation of Godand the habitation of man  are intersecting. That God is being revealed and God is actuallyacting in this world and  showing himself. And this is the most important thing in theuniverse -- to know God and  to know where he is accessible in the world is the most importantthing in the world to  know.    The Scribes and the Pharisees grumble thatJesus is eating with  tax-gatherers and sinners. What are you doing? they say. What doesthis mean? And Jesus  answers, quietly, and thunderously: What&#146;s happening here isthis;  the love of God  in heaven has entered the world through Jesus and is seeking andfinding what belongs to  God and is lost .     Jesus is saying: My receiving sinners andeating with them is like a  shepherd leaving 99 sheep and going out to find one lost sheep sothat the flock will be  complete; and then inviting his friends and neighbors to come andrejoice with him because  he found his sheep. My receiving sinners and eating with them islike a woman lighting a  lamp and sweeping her house and searching diligently for one lostcoin -- perhaps worth a  day&#146;s wages to her in her poverty -- until she finds it; andthen inviting her  friends and neighbors to come and rejoice with her because shefound it.    And if some scribe or Pharisee or one of ussays, I don&#146;t get it.  How is your receiving and eating with sinners like a shepherdseeking a lost sheep and  woman seeking a lost coin? I don&#146;t see any connection. Andhow is it like a  neighborhood party?     The key verses to answer this are verses 7 and10. Jesus says,           I tell you that in the same way  (thesame as in this parable)  there    will be  more  joy in heaven over one sinner whorepents, than over    ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. . . . (10)In the same way  (the    same as in this parable)  I tell you, there is joy in thepresence of the angels of God    over one sinner who repents.        And I can see Jesus looking around on thescribes and Pharisees and on  the tax-gatherers and sinners. The moment is hushed. And from faceto face he sees  something glorious and something terrible -- perhaps he sees ithappening even in this  room right now. On some faces the question mark begins to hardenand narrow into a tight,  resistant exclamation point of NO. NO. Nobody can talk like thatin a Barnes and Noble  world. Nobody -- parable or no parable, we can tell what you aresaying; we know this  presumption and arrogance -- nobody can claim what you areclaiming. That God Almighty, in  you, is seeking and finding his lost sheep. That the Old Testamentprophecy of Ezekiel 34  is being fulfilled in you (Then I will set over them oneshepherd, My servant David,  and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be theirshepherd. And I, the LORD,  will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them;I, the LORD, have  spoken vv. 23-24). That  you  are God&#146;s promisedMessiah. The Savior. That  when you receive sinners and they repent, they are part ofGod&#146;s flock -- because  they&#146;re in fellowship with  you ! That God is seekingthem in  you  and  rejoicing over them when they come to  you , which is thesame thing as coming to  him. We know what you are getting at. And we think it&#146;sblasphemy (in a Jewish  setting), or preposterous and arrogant (in a modern, pluralisticsetting).    That&#146;s one thing Jesus probably saw onsome faces. And it probably  made tears come to his eyes as he began his next story -- longer,even more heart-felt,  and ending with a word to the elder brothers with the hardexclamation points of NO on  their faces.    But he saw another kind of face around theroom. He&#146;s just been  condemned: This man receives sinners and eats with them. He hasjust answered: when I do  this it is like a shepherd seeking and finding a lost sheep and awoman seeking and  finding a lost coin. And they have just heard him say that thejoyful celebration of the  shepherd and the woman is a picture of the joyful celebration ofheaven over one of these  repentant sinners who is eating with me.    And on some of their faces now Jesus sees thelight of worship rising.  We hear you. You are the love of God seeking and finding whatbelongs to God. You are the  heart of God. You are the arm of God reaching out. You are thecrook of the  Shepherd&#146;s staff in the wilderness. You are the shoulders ofGod where the sheep gets  carried home. You are the lamp in the woman&#146;s house. You arethe broom with its  bristles in the dirt of our Barnes and Noble floor. And this mealright now, where you  receive sinners and eat with us, this is the party, isn&#146;t it?Or at least the  beginning of the party. And in your receiving us, God is receivingus. And in your joy we  see what God is like. He is happy that we have come home. We haveseen him. We have seen  the Father.    Two kinds of faces in a pluralistic world whereJesus says -- with  parable and actions -- I am the way the truth and the life.No one comes to the  Father but by me (John 14:6). Which is your face?      Three Applications:     Let me close with three briefapplications.        Repentance              Def: A turning from sin to embrace Christas God&#146;s      all-satisfying manifestation -- is necessary, but it&#146;sGod&#146;s aggressive      initiative in Jesus that brings it about.               Verse 7, There will be more joy in heavenover one sinner  who  repents  . . . Repentance is in the parable. But what wesee at the table is  Jesus receiving sinners and eating with them. Jesus is the seekingheart of God going out  after sinners and winning our repentance. We  must  repent.But he has not left us  alone in this. He has taken bold initiatives to reach us andchange us. This message today  and your being here is one of them. It is no accident. God is herein this word and is  speaking. And his word is this: come to the table, repent. Openyour eyes and see that the  banquet of being with Jesus is worth the cost of following Jesus(Luke 14:16-24, 25-33).         God            In spite of His majesty and holiness anduniversal power and      greatness, He astonishingly cares for individual human beingsone at a time.            There was one sheep -- out of a hundred -- andone coin -- out of ten.  God has a universe to run and galaxies to uphold and atomicparticles to manage and  governments to rule in his providence. But there is not much inthe Bible that says, all  heaven rejoices over orbits of the stars or the rise of kings or aglobal  women&#146;s&#146; conference in China. It&#146;s true that Godtakes pleasure in all that  he does. But Jesus is clearly referring to something special inthese parables. When one  sinner repents there is a special joy in heaven. God cares forindividuals one at a time.      The Ninety-nine            Finally, consider the worship of theninety-nine who are already in      the fold. Jesus says there is more joy in heaven over onesinner who repents than over      these ninety-nine. Does this mean that God does not delight inour worship? Does it mean      that personal evangelism is a more ultimate goal than worshipis?            No. John 4:23 says that the very meaning ofevangelism is that God is  seeking worshippers. The lost sheep is lost because he worshipssomething more than God.  The reason God rejoices so much over the winning of the lost isnot because God  doesn&#146;t have tremendous delight in worship, but because hedelights most in the  worship of the   whole   family. If we content ourselveswith our limited  worship experience, without wanting to include the lost sheep whodon&#146;t have this  joy, then the God we are dealing with in worship is not the God ofLuke 15.    Therefore, for the sake of worshipping the onetrue God for who he  really is, we are being called as a church -- in a Barnes andNoble world of diversity and  pluralism -- to leave the ninety-nine and receive sinners and eatwith them.
