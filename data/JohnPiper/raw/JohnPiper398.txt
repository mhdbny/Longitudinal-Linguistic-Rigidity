      January 30, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       LONG FOR THE PURE MILK OF THE WORD    (1 Peter 2:1-3)        Therefore, putting aside all malice andall guile and      hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babes, long      for the pure milk of the word, that by it you may grow in      respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the      Lord.         I hear so many prophetic words for us as a church in this text   I scarcely know where to begin. Let's go straight to one of them   and then back up and look at the whole passage.       A great threat to salvation and to our growth toward salvation   (v. 2) is what I would call spiritual fatalism -- the belief or   feeling that you are stuck with the way you are -- "this is all I   will ever experience of God -- the level of spiritual intensity   that I now have is all I can have; others may have strong desires   after God and may have deep experiences of personal pleasure in   God, but I will never have those because . . . well, just because   . . . I am not like that. That's not me."       This spiritual fatalism is a feeling that genetic forces and   family forces and the forces of my past experiences and present   circumstances are just too strong to allow me to ever change and   become more zealous for God (Tit. 2:14), or more fervent (Rom.   12:12), or more delighted in God (Psalm 37:4), or more hungry for   fellowship with Christ (John 6:35), or more at home with spiritual   things (Rom. 8:5), more bold (2 Tim. 1:7), or more constant or   joyful (Rom. 12:12) or hopeful (1 Pet. 1:13).       Spiritual fatalism is tragic in the church. It leaves people   stuck. It takes away hopes and dreams of change and growth. It   squashes the excitement of living -- which is growth. It's like   saying to a gawky little girl who feels like her body is all out   of proportion: well that's the way you are, and you will always be   that way, when in fact she is meant to grow and change. That would   be tragic to convince her of a kind of physical fatalism -- that   her growth is stopped right there at 13. So it is with the spirit.   Only spiritual fatalism is much worse. Because greater things are   at stake, and because we never do get to a point where we've   arrived at the final stature like we do in our physical bodies.       So thousands of people live year after year without much   passion for God or zeal for his name or joy in his presence or   hope in his promises or constancy in his fellowship and feel --   well, that's just the way I am. And they just settle in -- like an   adolescent who stops growing and lives with pimples till he's   eighty.       In this text God commands us not to be spiritual fatalists.   Peter says in verse 2: "Like newborn babes, long for the pure milk   of the word, that by it you may grow in respect to salvation." The   word for "long" here is very simply the word "desire" -- it's a   command to desire.       What this means is that if you feel stuck because you don't   have the kind of spiritual desires that you should, this text   says, You do not need to be stuck! It says, "Get them! -- Get the   desires you don't have." If you don't desire the milk of the word,   starting desiring it!       Now, isn't that amazing! A command to desire! A command to feel   longings we do not feel. A command to feel desires we do not have.   Is anything more contrary to spiritual fatalism than that.   Fatalism says, I can't just create desires. If they're not there   they're not there. If I don't feel things the way the Psalmists   seem to feel things when they say, "As a deer pants for the   flowing streams so my soul pants for you O God" (Psalm 42:1) -- if   I don't feel that way toward God, then that's that. I just don't.   I'm not like the Psalmists. That's what spiritual fatalism says.       But God says (v. 2), "Desire the pure milk of the Lord!" Now   before you raise all kinds of objections, like, How can you   command me to have a desire? What can I do to obey a command like   that? How do I just produce a desire? My whole problem is that I   don't have the strength of desire I want. And you just tell me to   desire. You may as well tell a lame man to walk.       Hmmm? Can you imagine such a thing -- commanding a lame man to   walk. Who could do such a thing. Or how about commanding a lame   man to fly? Do you think God might command that?       I was listening to a talk by Corrie Ten Boom yesterday and   heard her recite a little poem by John Bunyan. It's one of the   best statements I have ever heard about the difference between the   law and the gospel. You'll see how it relates.       Run, John, run, the law commands    But gives us neither feet nor hands,    Far better news the gospel brings:    It bids us fly and gives us wings.       In other words in the old covenant God gave commandments, but   by and large did not give the divine enablement that overcomes the   deadness and depravity and rebellion of the heart. But in the new   covenant, which God set up at the cross of Christ, God gives even   harder commands, but he also gives the power we need to fulfill   them (Rom. 8:4-6), through faith (1 Thes. 1:3; 2 Thes. 1:11).       Run, John, run, the law commands    But gives us neither feet nor hands,       We are duty-bound to run, even though our feet are willfully   frozen in the ice of sin. We can't run in ourselves, and so the   commands of the law condemn. And the gospel is not different in   having no commands, no conditions. Flying is harder than running.       Far better news the gospel brings:    It bids us fly and gives us wings.       This is powerful deliverance from spiritual fatalism. The   fatalist says, "I can't fly. I can't even run. My feet are frozen   in my genetic make up and my dysfunctional family of origin. And   besides that I don't have any wings. I cannot fly. That's the way   I am." But over against that fatalism, the gospel says, "Fly! You   don't have desires for the milk of the word? Well, have them."       What this says is that just as essential as having the desires   for the word that we are supposed to have is having the trust in   God that he gives what he commands. If God says to desire, when we   don't desire, then we trust him that he must know something we   don't know. He must have some power we don't have. There must be a   way. That's the opposite of spiritual fatalism. God commands it.   So there must be a way. I will not settle for less than what God   commands, even if it is a command to fly.       One of the ultimate non-fatalist statements was made by St.   Augustine. And it is deeply Biblical. In his Confessions (X, 40)   he said,        O love that ever burnest and art neverquenched! O      Charity, my God, enkindle me! Thou commandest continence. Grant      what thou commandest and command what thouwilt.         That is the way you are supposed to pray and believe when you   read 1 Peter 2:2, "Long for the pure milk of the word." Long for   it! Do you not have the longing? Get the longing! Do you not   desire the word? Start desiring it. Do not say, "I'm just this   way." Do not settle for spiritual fatalism. It is not God's will   for you.       That's one of the prophetic words I hear in this text for our   church.       Now I said I would stand back and get the whole text in view.   So you can see how this one part in verse 2 fits with the rest.       Notice that verse 1 begins with the word "therefore." So what   he is about to say is based on what just went before. What was   that? What just went before was the tremendous statement (v. 23)   that we are born again (by God) through the word of God. The point   was that this word is imperishable (v. 23) and that it is living   and active (v. 23) and that it is not like grass and flowers that   die but that it endures for ever. So if you have been born again   through this word, then you will last forever. You are secure   forever in the family of God, who caused you to be born again into   that family.       Therefore -- since you have new life by God's working and since   you have confidence about the future -- therefore, (2:1) "putting   aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and all   slander, 2 like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the   word."       Since you have been born again by the word of God, now long for   the word of God. Do you see the connection between the word of God   in verses 23-25? Born again by the word . . . therefore long for   the milk of the word. If you began you life with the word, sustain   your life with the word.       But your version may not say "milk of the word" in verse 2. It   may just have, "long for the spiritual milk." Well that's   accurate. The NASB here is an explanation, not just a translation.   But the explanation is a good one I think. Except, it's too   limiting. Is "the spiritual milk" merely the word of God? Or is it   something more specific in the word. I think it is.       Verses 2-3 say,        Like newborn babes (who were born by theword of God),      long (the way babies do) for the pure milk of the word, that by      it you may grow in respect to salvation, 3 if (that is, since!)      you have tasted the kindness of theLord.         Do you see the connection between the intense longing or   craving for the "spiritual milk" in verse 2 and the tasting of the   kindness of the Lord in verse 3? Put them together: "Long for the   spiritual milk, since you've tasted the kindness of the Lord." So   it seems to me that the milk is the milk of God's kindness. That   is what we are commanded to long for. So which is it: the milk of   the word (NASB)? Or the milk of God's kindness?       But there doesn't have to be a contradiction. Where did the   readers taste the kindness of the Lord? The answer is: in the   gospel, the word of God (v. 25). They were born again by that   kindness through the word of God. So the spiritual milk is the   kindness of the Lord experienced through the word of God. Or you   could say, the spiritual milk is the word of God revealing or   transmitting the kindness of the Lord."       You were born again by that word -- namely, by the powerful   kindness of God in that word, and now go on longing for that word   and for the day by day experience -- tasting -- of the kindness of   the Lord through his word.       If the word of God is powerful enough to create new Christians   (through new birth), then the word of God is powerful enough to   create desire in languishing Christian souls. Don't be a spiritual   fatalist. The power at work within you -- just to bring you to   life -- is like the power that raises the dead (Eph. 1:19-20). Can   it not create desire just like it created you. Trust it. To   paraphrase Bunyan's poem:       Run, John, run, the law commands    But gives us neither feet nor hands,    Far better news the gospel states:    It bids desire and then creates.       But it also destroys. Verse 1 describes the destructive side of   the word of God. "Therefore, putting aside (get rid of, destroy)   all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, 2   like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the word." One of   the ways the word of God creates desire for the milk of God's   kindness is by destroying desire for other things.       Malice: a desire to hurt someone with words or deeds.    Guile: a desire to gain some advantage or preserve some position   by deceiving others.    Hypocrisy: a desire not to be known for what really is.    Envy: a desire for some privilege or benefit that belongs to   another with resentment that another has it and you don't.    Slander: the desire for revenge and self-enhancement, often driven   by the deeper desire to deflect attention from our own failings.   The worse light we can put another in by slander, the less our own   darkness shows.       Malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, slander -- these we must put   away, destroy. This is the other side of longing for the spiritual   milk of God's kindness in the word. If you want to experience   desire for God's word; if you want your desires to grow; if you   want to taste fully the kindness of the Lord, realize that as our   satisfaction in God's kindness rises, the controlling desires of   malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy and slander are destroyed. And the   reverse is true: as you resist them and lay them aside, desires   for God grow stronger and more intense.       Peter's point is: don't think that they can flourish in the   same heart. Desire to taste and enjoy God's kindness cannot   flourish where in the same heart with guile and hypocrisy. So   fight against spiritual fatalism from both sides: fight to destroy   the desires of guile and hypocrisy; and fight to taste the   kindness of the Lord in his word.       The result will be (v. 2b) "you will grow in respect to   salvation." Literally: "you will grow into salvation." Salvation   is reached by growth. To be sure, God gives the growth (1:5; 1   Cor. 3:6). But growth is necessary. Do not fall into the spiritual   fatalism that says, "I can't grow; I can't change; and I don't   need to." Throw that idea away like a old smelly garment, and seek   God with all your heart for help in desiring his word, and let us   grow up together to salvation.
