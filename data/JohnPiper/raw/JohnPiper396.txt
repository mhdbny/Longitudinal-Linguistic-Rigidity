  January 16, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WHAT IS MAN?    REFLECTIONS ON ABORTION    AND RACIAL RECONCILIATION    (Psalm 8)        O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Thyname in all the      earth, who hast displayed Thy splendor above the heavens! From      the mouth of infants and nursing babes Thou hast established      strength, because of Thine adversaries, to make the enemy and      the revengeful cease. When I consider Thy heavens, the work of      Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained;      what is man, that Thou dost take thought of him? And the son of      man, that Thou dost care for him? Yet Thou hast made him a      little lower than God, and dost crown him with glory and      majesty! Thou dost make him to rule over the works of Thy      hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet, All sheep and      oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the      heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes through the      paths of the seas. O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Thy name      in all the earth!         I put before you this morning two massive realities in our   world -- one is abortion and one is racial alienation. My aim is   not to dwell on the awful connections between these two realities   -- like the fact that the biggest abortion provider in the nation,   Planned Parenthood, was founded by Margaret Sanger (died in 1966)   whose driving principles were explicitly racist.       In her book, Women and the New Race she wrote, "The most   merciful thing a large family can do to one of its infant members   is to kill it." 1  She said in her Book, The Pivot of   Civilization, that the so-called "inferior races" were in fact   "human weeds" and a "menace to civilization." She was a part of   the Eugenics movement (inspired by Thomas Malthus) that wanted to   purge the human race of "defectives, delinquents and dependents"   through calculated birth control, including abortion. 2        Profound and horrible things could be said about the interwoven   evils of abortion and racism. But that is not my purpose this   morning. My purpose for putting these two evils together this   morning is first chronological and then mainly theological and   Biblical.       Chronologically Martin Luther King Day comes on the third   Monday of January, and the Sanctity of Life Sunday comes on the   Sunday after the anniversary of Roe v. Wade on January 22. In   other words in the providence of God these two issues are forced   together every year. That's the chronological reason.       The theological reason is the main point of the message this   morning. These two issues are about God and about the nature of   man created in the image of God. What we believe about God and his   majesty, and what we believe about the meaning of being human in   relation to God will make all the difference in the world how we   think and act about abortion and racism -- if we really believe   what we say we believe.       Whatever personal imperfections Martin Luther King had -- and   there were some substantial ones -- King's life and mission were   driven by a Biblically-informed vision of God and man. In January   of 1956 King was receiving 30 hate letters a day. He was averaging   25 obscene phone calls a day. Death threats were normal. After   being awakened again by one of these calls in the middle in   Montgomery, Alabama, of the night King went to the kitchen and put   his head down on the table and prayed,       Oh, Lord, I'm down here trying to do what is right. But, Lord,   I must confess that I'm weak now. I'm afraid. The people are   looking to me for leadership, and if I stand before them without   strength and courage, they too will falter. I am at the end of my   powers. I have nothing left. I can't face it alone."       He tells this story in his book Strength to Love, and says that   what happened next was life-changing for him. It seemed as if an   inner voice was speaking to him with quiet assurance:       "Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness. Stand up for   justice. Stand up for truth. And, lo, I will be with you, even   unto the end of the world."       He saw lightening flash. He heard thunder roar. It was the   voice of Jesus telling him still to fight on. And       "he promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone. No   never alone, No, never alone. He promised never to leave me, never   to leave me alone . . ."       For the first time in his life God was profoundly real and   personal to him. The rest of his life, with all its imperfections,   was stamped by this experience. 3        Whatever one thinks of the Civil Rights movement or the Pro-   Life Movement, one thing is undeniable, historically: they have   been driven by a Biblically- informed vision of God and the   meaning of being human in relation to God. That is the theological   reason for putting these two realities together this morning.       What I want to do here is to bring a Biblical vision of God and   man to bear on these two evils of abortion and racial alienation.   And then I want to draw out of this vision a truth that I pray   will profoundly influence our lives for the sake of the unborn and   for the sake of racial reconciliation.       The vision comes from Psalm 8. It can be put into words perhaps   something like this: The majesty of God is great beyond words and   worthy of our fervent worship and allegiance. And that majesty is   manifest in the glory of God's supreme creation, human beings made   in his image.       And the truth that I draw out of this vision of God and man is   this: You cannot worship and glorify the majesty of God while   treating his supreme creation with contempt       The vision is that God is majestic above all the majesties of   the universe and this majesty -- though dimmed and besmirched and   defiled by sin -- shines in the glory of God's supreme creation,   human beings. And the truth that flows from this vision is that we   cannot worship and glorify the majesty of God while treating his   supreme creation with contempt.       Let's look at the text to see this vision and flesh out the   truth. The Psalm begins and ends with the same statement. That   makes it the unmistakably main statement. Everything else serves   this.       Verse 1: O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Thy name in all the   earth, who hast displayed Thy splendor above the heavens! . . . 9   O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Thy name in all the earth!       So the vision of God in this psalm is that he is LORD, Yahweh   -- the first "Lord" = Yahweh, the great I AM, the absolute God who   simply IS without beginning and ending and utterly self-sufficient   and free -- O LORD! And the vision is that he is OUR lord -- the   God who makes a covenant with all who trust him, so that he   becomes OURS. And the vision is that his name is majestic -- his   name = his true identity and character and nature and reputation,   all that there is about him is majestic and glorious. "IN ALL THE   EARTH" -- he is not a tribal god or a territorial deity; he is   majestic and supreme over all the earth and his splendor is above   the heavens.       That's the first part of the vision. The second part is found   in verses 3-6:       When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, The moon   and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man, that Thou   dost take thought of him? And the son of man, that Thou dost care   for him? Yet Thou hast made him a little lower than God, and dost   crown him with glory and majesty! Thou dost make him to rule over   the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet.       When Noel and I visited the Kennedy Space center on our   anniversary trip to Florida a few weeks ago we saw two of those   huge IMAX films of the earth from space and of the incredible   power of the shuttle launches. If I did not know God I would be   tempted to bow down and worship the men who created such things.   And, of course, millions of humans do bow down, in one way or the   other, and worship at the altar of human achievement.       But they are making the same mistake that you would make if you   bowed down and worshipped a computer, failing to realize that a   human being thought this up and designed it and made it. So it is   when we bow down and worship human intelligence and creativity --   we fail to realize that God thought up this human, God imagined us   and designed us and made us, and we are as helpless without him as   when a computer is unplugged. God alone is to be worshipped.   That's the point of verses 1 and 9.       But verses 3-5 teach us that, as a means of worshipping God, it   is fitting that I stand in awe of the achievements of the NASA   scientists. God has crowned human beings with glory and majesty.   GOD has put all that he has made under man's feet. GOD has made us   lords of the earth, and perhaps of the planets. We have this role   under God because God is utterly secure in his absolute majesty.   We are as dependent on God as a computer is dependent on being   plugged in.       So the vision of Psalm 8 is that God is majestic beyond words   and his majesty is manifest in the glory of his supreme creation   -- the human being.       Now I hope you will agree from this psalm that the truth   follows: You cannot worship and glorify the majesty of God while   treating his supreme creation with contempt -- whatever color or   whatever age that creation might be.       You cannot starve the aged human and glorify the majesty of   God.       You cannot dismember the unborn human and glorify the majesty   of God.       You cannot gas the Jewish human and glorify the majesty of God.       You cannot lynch the black human and glorify the majesty of   God.       You cannot treat human pregnancy like a disease and glorify the   majesty of God.       You cannot treat the mixing of human races like a pestilence   and glorify the majesty of God.       You cannot worship and glorify the majesty of God while   treating his supreme creation with contempt.       The next time someone asks you, "Why are you against abortion?"   try answering, "Because no amount of inconvenience could ever   justify treating the supreme creation of God with murderous   contempt." And if someone asks you, "Why are you willing to stay   in a racially changing neighborhood when the value of your house   is plummeting?" try answering, "Because no amount of real estate   value could ever justify treating the supreme creation of God with   contempt." And then read them Psalm 8 and show them a vision of   God and of what it means to be human. That may lift them higher in   their thoughts than they have ever gone before.       Tonight we will focus, with William Pannell's help, on racial   reconciliation and give it our full attention. So let me close   with a brief focus this morning on the other issue: the value of   the life of children -- whatever color.       Verse 2 is a remarkable verse in this regard. It says, "From   the mouth of infants and nursing babes Thou &#91;God&#93; hast   established strength, because of Thine adversaries, to make the   enemy and the revengeful cease." Now there are a few unclear   things in this verse. But let's take what seems to be fairly   clear.       The verse says that God has adversaries, enemies, people who   are revengeful. And the verse says that these adversaries are   going to be stilled, silenced, made to cease. And the verse says   that the means of God's triumph here over his adversaries is what   comes out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies. Now how is   it that what comes out of the mouth of nursing babes can put the   adversary of God to nought?       Let me make a suggestion for you to consider. Verse 5, I think,   gives the key. David asks in verse 4, "What is man?" What is this   being called ADAM -- man? And he answers, first, "Thou hast made   him a little lower than God, and dost crown him with glory and   majesty!" He answers: humans are made by God -- "Thou hast made   him." And he answers, secondly, that these beings whom God makes   are made in a radically different category from the animals -- "a   little less than God (or "a little less than angels," elohim can   mean that cf. Heb. 2:7)." And he answers, thirdly, that these   beings created by God, a little less than angels, are crowed with   glory and majesty.       Now connect that with the infant humans and nursing babes of   verse 2. "From the mouth of infants and nursing babes Thou   &#91;God&#93; hast established strength, because of Thine   adversaries, to make the enemy and the revengeful cease." Why is   it that what comes out of the mouth of these little humans has   such strength that it can overcome the enemies of God? I think the   answer is, at least in part, given by verse 5 - - these little   ones are made by God. Job said in Job 31:15 "Did not He who made   me in the womb make him &#91;my servant&#93;, and the same one   fashion us in the womb?" 4   Little infants and sucking   babes are each made by God in the womb.       Moreover they are made in the womb, like no other being, a   little less than the angels, and they are made in the womb by God   and crowned with glory and majesty. In other words, their supreme   place in creation under God (or the angels) is so profound even at   the stage of being sucklings that when they open their mouth to   cry or to coo or to babble as a human being, they are bearing   witness to their unspeakable dignity in creation and therefore to   the majesty of God's name in all the earth. God does not wait   until a sucking babe is rational and independent to ascribe to him   the glory and majesty of verse 5 -- he doesn't have to be a NASA   scientist. When the suckling opens his mouth God is praised,   strength is established by the sheer truth that a human creation   in the image of the majestic God is here. Let all the adversaries   of God take note and tremble. If they treat God's supreme creation   with contempt they will lose. They will be silenced.       And so I appeal to you, do not join with the adversaries of God   in killing unborn children or scorning any race of human beings.   Because the truth of this text stands sure: You cannot worship and   glorify the majesty of God while treating his supreme creation   with contempt.         1  Quoted in George Grant, Grand Illusions: The Legacy   of Planned Parenthood, Brentwood, Tennessee: Wolgemuth and Hyatt,   Publishers, Inc., 1988, p. 59.        2  Grand Illusions, p. 91.        3  Quoted from Stephen Oates, Let the Trumpet Sound:   The Life of Martin Luther King, Jr., (New York: Mentor, Penguin   Group, 1982) p. 85.        4  See Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139:13 for other   references to God's making the child in the womb.
