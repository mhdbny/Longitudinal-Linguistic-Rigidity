 June 7, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       The day of Praise Procession #2    "Should not I pity that great city -- Minneapolis?"    (Jonah 3:10 - 4:11)        If the only feeling that you have toward a person is the   feeling of disgusted anger, you probably will not be able to   minister to that person. I say "probably" because you might use   all your will power for some reason other than love--like fear of   God's judgment--and say something or do something for a person you   despise, and God might use it to bless the person. That's exactly   what happened to Jonah. He detested the Ninevites. But he did not   want to face another fish-swallowing. So he delivered God's   message, and God used it to convert the whole city.        So yes, God can use people who do right things for wrong   reasons. God can love through you even when you are not loving   through him! But the point of the book of  Jonah  is:   that's not good. You do not do well Jonah to feel the way you do   about Nineveh. The point of this book is to show us what kind of   heart for the city urban prophets are supposed to have. And the   way God shows us what kind of heart we should have toward   Minneapolis as a city is to show us his heart.        When we head out of this building in half an hour and walk   through 1.7 miles of this modern Nineveh, even if every person   felt only disgusted anger at the godlessness and sin of this city,   God might use our words to bless this city with spiritual   awakening and salvation. That's exactly what he did for Jonah.   Isn't that amazing! Have you ever heard anyone say, "God won't use   a dirty vessel."?
 It's well meant; but it's overstated. What   was Jonah if he was not a dirty vessel? He was dirty with   selfishness and hardheartedness and pitilessness. And God saved   the whole city through his preaching. The power of God is not   limited to our purity.        Don't ever forget that, because Satan, between now and 30   minutes from now, is going to say to some of you, "You are an out   and out hypocrite to walk in that praise procession. You can't   love this city, you don't even love your wife! You better just go   home and leave public praise to the pure in heart." Now when Satan   says that, here's what you say back to him, "God saved Nineveh   through the words of selfish prophet. This much I know: God is   God, and I need God and this city needs God, and I am going to go   say so. So, in the name of Jesus, just go jump in the lake,   Satan."        That might be all you can say. But I think God has more for you   this morning. So come with me now for a few minutes into the heart   of God. God is going to take us where we are in our heart for the   city this morning and he's going to use us just like that. But I   believe that in the next hour God's going to change hundreds of   hearts for this city.        He is going to work on us the same way he worked on Jonah. So   let's watch him and let him do it to us. Just put yourself in   Jonah's place as much as you need to.         1. God shows at least four areas where he and Jonah   agree.  Jonah is not a theological liberal. He holds fast   to Biblical truth.        First, they agree that Nineveh is wicked. In Jonah 1:2 God says   to Jonah, "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city and cry against   it; for their wickedness has come up before me." And in Jonah 3:9   the king of Nineveh admitted that God had a fierce anger against   Nineveh for their evil and violence.        Second, he agrees that God can save rebels miraculously,   because that is what happened to him. His song about God's rescue   from the belly of the fish ends in 2:9 with "Deliverance belongs   to the Lord!" So Jonah knows that God can rescue disobedient   rebels who are about to die.        Third, they agree that it's God's nature to be gracious and   merciful. Jonah 4:2, "I knew that you are a gracious God and   merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love."        In fact, fourth, Jonah agreed that God would very likely act   this way in the case of Nineveh. So in 4:2 he confesses very   openly that this is why he fled to Tarshish in the first place,   not because he feared the Ninevites, but because he knew God would   show mercy to them. "Is not this what I said when I was yet in my   country; that is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew   you are a gracious God."        So the first thing God does in dealing with Jonah is to reveal   agreement. The prophet and his God are at odds. But not totally.   God lets the agreement show. And that's true for every person in   this room. You are not totally at odds with God. There are some   points of agreement.         2. God makes the key point of disagreement   clear . It isn't theological, its experiential. The   theological agreement Jonah has with God is not producing a heart   agreement. They do not have the same heart toward Nineveh.        The book closes with the words of God, "Should not I pity   Nineveh?" Jonah's attitude of contempt and vengeance is shown to   be far from God's. Jonah's anger consumes whatever pity may have   been there. God's pity modifies his anger.         3. But notice how God not only treats Nineveh with pity   and mercy, but also treats his stiff-necked prophet that way   too . He is slow to anger and ready to relent in his wrath   toward Nineveh, and toward Jonah. How does this show itself?        First, through the fish: God could have let Jonah drown. But he   saved him and gave him another chance.        Second, through the plant in 4:6: Jonah had gone outside the   city in anger when the Ninevites repented. He was sulking outside   town while God was rescuing the city. It's just like when he was   thrown overboard. He saved the men on the ship by telling the   truth and was thrown overboard. And he saved Nineveh by telling   the truth, and then went outside the city to pout. In the sea God   appointed a fish to save him. And look at what God does in 4:6,   "And the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah   that it might be a shade over his head to save him from his   discomfort." Isn't that amazing mercy. When we shout in the city   in a few minutes, "Let mercy triumph over judgment," this is the   sort of thing we will mean.        Third, God treats Jonah with mercy and pity not only with the   fish and the plant, but also by asking questions instead of giving   indictments. Look at 4:4: After Jonah said in verse 3 that he   would rather die than see Nineveh saved, God does not explode with   rage at such a merciless attitude, he asks a question. The Lord   said, "Do you do well to be angry?" Then in verse 9 after Jonah   got more angry at the death of the plant than at the possible   destruction of Nineveh, God again asked a question: "Do you do   well to be angry for the plant?" God could have blasted Jonah with   tremendous indignation. But he treats Jonah the same way he   treated Nineveh. So Jonah's life was hanging on the very mercy   toward himself that he resented being shown to Nineveh.         4. Now finally, the fourth thing God did to change   Jonah's heart was to stoop down and give Jonah some reasons for   why he has pity on Nineveh . This is why I said the   head-agreement between Jonah and God was limited. There are things   Jonah does not realize about God. And if he thinks about them--we   think about them as we go--he and we may find our hearts pitying   and loving Minneapolis more than we ever have.         Take them as they come in 4:10-11.         1. And the Lord said, "You pity the plant." What did he mean by   that? Verse 9 said he was angry about the plant. But why? Because   this worm had attacked the plant and killed it. Do you see what   God is doing? He is helping Jonah see where his pity for Nineveh   comes from. He says, You pity the plant, should not I pity   Nineveh. But a worm destroyed the plant! Yes, Jonah, and a worm   has been at work to destroy Nineveh ever since I planted this   city. Reckon with the worm-factor, Jonah--the Satan factor. The   god of this world is blinding the eyes of people in every city.   Pity comes from reckoning with a worm factor when somebody--or   some city--lets you down and falls short of God's laws.        2. The second reason God feels pity for Nineveh in verse 10 is   that he labored over Nineveh and made it grow. "You pity the   plant, for which you did not labor nor make it grow." The point is   the contrast: I did labor over Nineveh; it was I who made it   grow.        Here we need to see that our strong belief in the providence   and sovereignty of God should give us a glimpse of God's pity for   cities. Cities are not autonomous. They do not grow without God.   Even though the people in them may think that they are building a   monument to human independence, they aren't. They depend on God at   every minute and not a single building in this city was built   without God's work. The waterworks, the sewer system, the   electricity, the traffic plan, the government structure, the laws   and ordinances, the educational and cultural and technical and   entertainment institutions--they are all there because God's gifts   and God's power and God's wisdom have been used. Minneapolis is   God's city. He has labored over it and he has made it grow. Cities   are not any more autonomous than people are. They live and move   and have their being in God. And so God does not quickly or easily   destroy the work of his hands.        3. The third reason God gives Jonah for his pity in verse 10 is   that Nineveh is a very old city. Again the contrast with the plant   is the point: "You pity the plant, for which you did not labor nor   make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a   night." In other words, its life was brief, unlike Nineveh.        Nineveh is referred to in Genesis 10. It is a very old city.   God has been involved with Nineveh a long time. It's institutions   and buildings and laws bear the marks--no matter how distorted by   sin--of God's image. All these humans who for centuries have   planned and organized and built have been people created in the   image of God, and what they have made carries the imprint of that   image.        The work of God in Minneapolis goes back for centuries into the   Indian culture long before any white men came. But the city we   know today took its start in 1680 when Father Louis Hennepin ( a   Belgian priest) was the first white man to set his eyes on St.   Anthony Falls. One of the paintings that survives shows him   holding a cross over his head and blessing the falls and the   region of Minneapolis. Who knows what blessings this city has   reaped because the first Christian man who came held a cross over   it and asked God's blessing. This does not excuse the sins of   white people. It only means that we may be the heirs of a work of   God that may be greater for his glory than any of us realizes.        4. The fourth reason God gives to Jonah for pitying Nineveh is   weakness of moral confusion. Verse 11: "And should I not pity   Nineveh that great city in which there are more than a hundred and   twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from   their left?" This might refer to little children who are old   enough to know right and left. But there's no other place in the   O.T. where children are described like this, and the generic word   for human (adam) is used, not a word for child.        This is what Jesus meant when he prayed, "Father, forgive them,   for they don't know what they do" (Luke 23:34). Yes, they were   guilty. This ignorance does not make one innocent. It is owing to   real corruption and sin. But there is also a weakness component.   "He knows our frame," Psalm 103 says, "he remembers that we are   dust."        Knowing the right hand from the left is basic to following the   simplest instructions. "Go to 11th Avenue and turn left; then   right on Franklin, and right again on Park and right again on   Eighth Street." So what God means is that the people are so   morally adrift that they can't even follow the most basic moral   instructions: like thou shalt not kill. God looks at the moral   confusion and pities the city.        5. Finally, God closes his reasoning on an utterly unexpected   note: besides he says, "there are many cattle." Now don't get the   idea that this is the basis of some sentimental vision of animal   rights. God ordains that cattle be killed for sacrifices every   day. He ordained them for meat according to Genesis 9:3.        Then what's the point. I think the point is: God made cattle   and hundreds of other things to be useful to man. And the tragedy   of judgment is made worse when things which are meant for good   uses are simply swept away in judgment. When fire and brimstone   fell on Sodom and Gomorrah everything was consumed.        The point for us in all this is that in spite of all the sin   and rebellion and immorality and cynicism in our city, God pities   Minneapolis; he has compassion on our city. He wants us to feel   that compassion with him as we sing and march today. I believe the   Lord will use your involvement today wherever you are in this   matter. And I think that by participating God will give us his   heart more fully than we have ever experienced.        Isaiah 12:5-6    Sing praises to the Lord    for He has done gloriously.    Let this be known in all the earth    Shout and sing for joy O inhabitant of Zion.    For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
