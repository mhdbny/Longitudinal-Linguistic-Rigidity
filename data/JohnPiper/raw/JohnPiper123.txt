  October 19, 1986Bethlehem Baptist ChurchMorningPastor John Piper, preachingCopyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper    BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER  Ephesians 4:31-5:2 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put awayfrom you, with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgivingone another, as God in Christ forgave you. Therefore be imitators of God,as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himselfup for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. This text is so rich that we could take almost any of its phrases and dwellon it for hours. But I have decided to gather our thoughts around the simplecommandment in verse 32, "Be kind to one another." As I have pondered these verses it seems to me that they tell us five thingsabout Christian kindness:        The extent of Christian kindness,       The depth of Christian kindness,       The pattern of Christian kindness,       The instrument of Christian kindness, and       The source of Christian kindness.  Let's look at these one at a time. And as we do let's pray that the Spiritof God would honor his word by causing us to be changed by it. 1. The extent of Christian kindness. How much kindness should we show? This is addressed in verse 31. Christiankindness is so extensive that it replaces, "All bitterness and wrath andanger and clamor and slander . . . with all malice." The word "all" is usedtwice: at the beginning, "all bitterness" and at the end, "all malice." Theseare part of the old corrupt self that must be put off. And kindness is theopposite new self that must be put on. Paul is still giving specificillustrations of the principle in verses 22-24. But the question rises whether all wrath and anger should be replaced bykindness. Bitterness, yes. Outbreaks of clamoring belligerence, yes.Rumor-mongering and evil speaking behind backs, yes. Malice, yes. All these,no exceptions, all these must go. But what about wrath and anger? We spent the whole evening together two weeks ago trying to sort this out.Verse 26 says, "Be angry but do not sin." And James 1:19 says, "Be slow toanger." And Mark 3:5 says that Jesus looked on the Pharisees with anger.Does the kindness of Jesus always extend to the Pharisees? Is it kind tosay to them, as Jesus does in Matthew 23:27, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs"? Is it kindness when he saysin Matthew 23:15, "Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for youcross sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte,you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves"? Was it kindnesswhen Jesus made a whip of cords and drove out the money changers from thetemple and turned over their tables (John 2:15, Mt. 21:12)? If you walked up to Jesus after he had done these things, and said, "Jesus,that was unkind of you to say that to the Pharisees," what would he havesaid? There are two possible things he could have said. He could have said,"Sometimes a heart of love and a passion for the truth don't express themselvesin the form of kindness." Or he could have said, "There is a sort of kindnessthat can be hard as nails and tough as leather." Which do you think he wouldhave said: "Kindness is big enough to include whipping and woes"? Or: "Kindnessis one form of righteousness, but not always the best one"? As I have looked over all the uses of the word "kindness" in the New TestamentI think we would honor the the special tenderness of the word more by sayingthat Jesus was not being kind to the Pharisees. He was being severe withthem. And Romans 11:22 separates the kindness of God and the severity ofGod. So kindness is not an absolute virtue. It is not always the most lovingthing to do. It may involve a compromise with evil so serious that in thelong run it hurts more people than it helps. So when Paul says in Ephesians 4:26 that we should be angry but not sin,and then says in verses 31-32, get rid of anger and be kind, what I takehim to mean is this very thing: All inner bitterness and malice must go.Their eruptions in slander and brawling must go. But when it comes to emotionalindignation and you perceive that the teaching of Christ is disobeyed andthe glory of God is diminished and the good of the church is in jeopardy,then, under the sway of the Holy Spirit, you must choose: shall I give ventto my anger in severity because the cause of truth and holiness is at stake,or shall I mortify my anger with kindness because there is too much of selfin it? Both are possible in the path of righteousness. And so the extent of Christiankindness is not precise. It may be wider or narrower than we think. Thisis a call for deep self-examination in the light of Holy Scripture and thedeceptiveness of our own heart.  2. The depth of Christian kindness. The point here is that Christian kindness is not merely an external changeof manners, it is an internal change of heart. Verse 32 says, "Be kind toone another, tenderhearted. . ." Christian kindness is tenderhearted. Ifthe heart is hard on the inside and the manners are meek and polite and helpfulon the outside, it is not Christian kindness. The idea behind "tenderhearted" is that our insides are easily touched. Whenyour skin is tender, it doesn't take a very hard touch to make it feel pain.When your heart is tender, it is easily affected. It feels easily and quickly. When you stop and think about it, it is remarkable that this is commandedby the apostle. You can't just decide to be tenderhearted and turn it onlike a faucet. It is a deep character quality. Where does it come from? Howcan we obey this command to make our kindness to each other deep and heart-felt,not superficial and cool? We will see as we move on.  3. The pattern of Christian kindness. Two patterns of Christian kindness are given for us in the text. First isthe forgiveness of God. Second is the love of Christ. The first we see in verse 32: "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgivingone another, as God in Christ forgave you." So when kindness calls forforgiveness, the pattern is the forgiveness of God in Christ. The second pattern is seen in 5:2, "Walk in love, as Christ loved us andgave himself up for us." So when love expresses itself in kindness the patternis the love of Christ giving himself up for us. What do these two patterns of kindness teach us about being kind to eachother? Let's take them one at a time. What does the pattern of God's forgivenessteach us about our own? Four things come to mind: 1) God's forgiveness takes sin seriously and so should ours. Forgivenessis not flippancy toward sin. It sees it and names it -- and then covers it.God forgives what he hates. When I called a man recently to apologize for something I had said and seekhis forgiveness, he didn't say, "It makes no difference." Or: "I didn't hearit." He said earnestly and warmly, "Forgiven, and forgotten." And I got thedeep impression he really meant it. 2) God's forgiveness reckons with a real settling of accounts and so shouldours. Every sin that has ever been committed will be justly punished -- eitherin hell or on the cross. God never sweeps one little lie under the rug. Someonealways pays. So when kindness calls us to forgive a wrong that has been done against us,we are sustained by the truth of God's holiness. That wrong is going to bedealt with: either the person who committed it against us will trust Christin the end, in which case the wrong they committed is punished in the wraththat was poured on Christ when the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all(Isaiah 53:4-6); or the person who committed the wrong against us is notgoing to trust Christ in the end, in which case the wrong that they committedwill be punished in the sufferings of hell. And in neither case should wefear to forgive as though there were no settling of accounts in the universe. 3) God's forgiveness was costly and so is ours. It cost God his Son. Andit will cost us the sweet taste of revenge and the pleasure of savoring agrudge and the pride of superiority. 4) God's forgiveness is real and ours should be too. There is no sham init. When he forgives, we are really restored. Nothing is held over our headsfor later blackmail. It is gone: "As far as the east is from the west, sofar does he remove our transgressions from us" (Psalm 103:12). And so fall short of our divine pattern if we forgive a wrong but secretlyplan to keep it in the back of our minds for a later touche. When we forgive,let us really forgive one another, as God in Christ forgave us. That is the pattern of God's forgiveness and four things we can learn fromit in pursuing the path of kindness. The second pattern for our kindnessis the love of Christ in 5:2, "Walk in love, as Christ loved us and gavehimself up for us." What does the pattern of Christ's love teach us aboutour own? Out of all the things we could say let me just mention three. 1) The love of Christ for us is undeserved, and so we shouldn't insist thatpeople earn our love and our kindness either. Jesus said in Luke 6:35, "Loveyour enemies, and do good. . . and you will be sons of the Most High; forhe is kind to the ungrateful and the selfish." None of us has ever qualifiedto be loved by Jesus Christ. Freely we have received it; freely we shouldgive it (Mt. 10:8). 2) The love of Christ for us is holy and ours should be holy. The aim ofthe love of Christ is the holiness of his church: "Christ loved the churchand gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her . . . and presenther to himself in glory . . . that she might be holy and without blemish"(Eph. 5:25-27). And therefore we should put away all notions of love that are driven by meresentiment and emotion. Love aims at the holiness of a man and a woman, notat their approval or their worldly happiness. Christian kindness is not astrategy to avoid conflict. It's patterned on the love of Christ and aimsto promote holiness. 3) The love of Christ for us was sacrificial and self-denying, and ours shouldbe too. This is basically the same thing we said earlier, namely, that thelove of God was costly. But it is good to say it again. Because everyoneof us knows that the hardest thing about Christian kindness is to show itwhen it hurts. I have never forgotten the kindness shown to me by Frau Dora Goppelt in 1974during the weeks following the unexpected death of her husband, my Doktorvaterin Germany. It is a miracle of grace when the pain of loss is so great thatyou don't know if you can last another day, and yet you reach out in kindnessto a foreign student and reassure him that three years of labor will notbe lost with the death of his mentor. A miracle of grace! That brings us to the fourth thing that this text teachesus about Christian kindness. We have seen the extent of Christian kindnessin replacing all bitterness and malice and slander. We have seen the depthof Christian kindness in tenderness of heart. We have seen the pattern ofChristian kindness in the forgiveness of God and the love of Christ. Nowwe look at  4. The instrument of Christian kindness. What do I mean by the "instrument" of Christian kindness? I mean to ask,what is it that we must employ or exert in order to become kind andtenderhearted? The answer is hinted at in the form of the verb in verse 31. Literally itsays, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be takenaway from you. . ." The verb is passive. This is a hint that the instrumentof our kindness is not simply ourselves. If left to ourselves we will nomore be able to get the bitterness and malice out of our heart than we canlift ourselves by our own bootstraps. It doesn't lie within us. They must BE TAKEN from us. "Let all bitterness. . . BE taken away from you."Someone else is at work here besides us. It is the same thing we saw in verse23: "BE renewed in the spirit of your mind." (Another passive verb!) Theremust be a renewing power or person. There must be a power that takes bitternessand malice from my heart and makes me tenderhearted and kind. And we know what that power is (who that person is!) because Galatians 5:22says very plainly, "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,kindness. . ." If the Spirit of God does not come into our lives to do asupernatural work, we may be able to spruce up the outward manners of kindness,but the poison within will remain. Of that Paul says, "Let it BE taken away.. ." This is a cry for the work of the Spirit to conquer the old self andclothe us with the new. But the question is not fully answered. We must still ask, What is the instrumentwith which I appropriate the power of the Holy Spirit? And the answer isfaith. The Spirit flows in the channels of faith. Paul cries out in Galatians3:2-3, "Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing withfaith? Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now endingwith the flesh?" And our answer should be a resounding, NO! I am not trying to overcome mybitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander and malice in the powerof the flesh! I am looking to the Holy Spirit to bear his fruit in my life.How am I looking? What am I doing? I am doing what I did to receive him inthe first place: I am believing. I am trusting. Which leaves one last question: what must I believe, in order to see theHoly Spirit conquer the bitterness and anger and malice of my heart and makeme tenderhearted and kind? That is the fifth thing that our text teachesus about Christian kindness.  5. The source of Christian kindness. The text tells us what we must believe if the Spirit of God is to conquerunkindness in our hearts. Three things: 1) We must believe that Christ died in our place. Verse 2: "Christ lovedus and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."That is simply an awful sentence -- that the slaughter of his Son smelledgood to God!!! There are in this sentence realities so great and so awfuland so wonderful and so devastating that when we believe them they are thepower of God unto sanctification and a great uprooting of unkindness. 2) We must believe that God has forgiven all our sins. Verse 32: ". . . forgivingone another as God in Christ forgave you." In order to be kind you must beforgiven. In order to be kind you must believe that you are forgiven forall the sins you have ever committed and will ever commit. To know and believethat every slap in God's face has been forgiven freely in Jesus Christ breaksa Christian's heart and makes it lowly and tender and kind. 3) Finally we must believe that we are loved by God. Verse 1: "Be imitatorsof God, as loved children." As LOVED children! Child of God, you are lovedby God! Believe this with all your heart, and you will behold a miracle inyour own life -- the fruit of the Spirit, the gift of God! Brothers and sisters in Christ, let us believe these things, and be kindto one another! Amen.   Copyright 1996,1999 John Piper    Piper's Notes
