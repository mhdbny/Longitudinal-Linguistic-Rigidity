 February 23, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       RECEIVING CHILDREN IN JESUS'S NAME    (Mark 9:33-37)         And when they came to Capernaum; and when he was      in the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the      way?" But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed      with one another who was the greatest. And he sat down and      called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any one would be      first, he must be last of all and servant of all." And he took      a child and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his      arms, he said to them, "Whoever receives one such child in my      name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but      him who sent me."                If you leave out the heartache of miscarriages and the genocide   of abortion (which this conference did) the statistics of the   conference are painful enough. Fourteen million children who reach   the age of birth die each year before the age of five. If we could   all put a face on each of those children and hear the wheezing and   the cries and feel the final limp silence, what an ocean of grief   would fill the world. I always marvel at the awesome emotional   depth and complexity of God that enables him to empathize with the   grief of millions and millions of parents all the time, and yet   rejoice with those who rejoice in him.        Of these fourteen million, about ten million die from five   conditions: about five million from diarrhea, about three million   from measles, tetanus, and whooping cough, and about two million   from respiratory infections, mainly pneumonia. Most of these could   be saved by simple Oral Rehydration Therapies for the diarrhea, a   five dollar injection for the measles, tetanus and whooping cough,   and a $.50 antibiotic for the respiratory problems.        But of course the vast majority of these children are among the   desperately poor, far from the medical blessings we take for   grated. About 800,000,000 people live in absolute poverty. Of   these, 70,000,000 are on the threshold of starvation. Another   400,000,000 consume less than the "minimum critical diet." Half of   the children of the absolute poor do not live to be 5. Over 100   million children are always hungry. Keep in mind that about   195,000,000 of these poor are professing Christians.        Even if Jesus hadn't said things as stunning as we read in this   text, children would have to be a major concern, because 30% of   the world's six and a half billion people are under the age of 15.   There are at least 90 countries where over 40% of the population   is under 15 and several countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe where   over half the population is under 15.        Increasingly these children are not only the victims of   malnutrition and disease and starvation but also of violence. Let   me make this painfully vivid with a quote from a letter I got last   week from Robert Seiple, the president of World Vision.        One of our sponsored children, a 14 year old Palestinian boy   living on the West Bank, was caught by 16 Israeli soldiers as he   was writing graffiti on a wall. The soldiers placed him up against   the wall, and one shot him four times in the eye. As he lay on the   ground, still alive, he was savagely beaten for almost an hour.   During that time he was forced to stick his finger into his wound   and wipe out the graffiti with his own blood. He was then bound   and dragged through the village streets; finally thrown into the   back of a jeep, and rudely dumped at a local hospital.   Miraculously, he lived. Tragically this incident is not atypical.   The entire drama was witnessed by an American. It has since been   recorded in Western journals.        Now the point here is not to criticize other nations, or to say   that atrocities only happen to children in war-torn regions.   America is one of the most violent countries in the world against   its children. Not only do we kill a million and a half pre-born   children a year, but 22% of the children in America live in   poverty; one out of every four girls under eighteen has probably   been sexually abused by someone close to her; possibly as high as   30% of all mental retardation may be owing to fetal alcohol   syndrome; one study of 36 hospitals showed that in 10% of the   pregnancies mothers used illegal drugs during pregnancy; and 89%   of school teachers surveyed report that abuse and neglect of   children are a problem in their education. The American home is   increasingly an unsafe place for children to be. And there is no   better place. The family is God's will.        * * *        Now let me put over against this the word of the Lord   Jesus--the word that has absolute authority for all Christians and   shows us how to spend our short lives in the most significant way,   and gets at the root of why so many children suffer from neglect   and abuse.        In our text Jesus says two very powerful things that will   transform the way we relate to children. And between these two   things, one in verse 35 and the other in verse 37, Jesus places a   real living child. Let's listen to these two things that Jesus   says and see what the child has to do with each one.        The first thing Jesus says is in response to the fact that the   disciples were discussing who of them was the greatest. Verse 34:   "But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one   another who was the greatest." To this Jesus responds with his   first word (verse 35): "He sat down and called the twelve; and he   said to them, 'If anyone would be first, he must be last of all   and servant of all.'"        What Jesus does here is very profound. He recognizes in his   disciples' quest for greatness a good thing that has become ugly   and distorted by sin. And instead of destroying the whole   distorted thing, he describes a pathway on which the distorted and   ugly pursuit of greatness will be radically transformed into   something beautiful.        Nowhere does Jesus criticize a person for pursuing true   greatness or true significance. I think that's because he created   us to be great and to be significant--to come to the end of our   lives and feel that they were well spent and well invested. But   what has happened to this God-given longing for greatness is that   it has been corrupted by sin in two ways:    1) it has been corrupted into a longing not to be great, but to be   known as great; and 2) it has been corrupted into a longing not to   be great, but to be greater than someone else.        In other words, the joy of true greatness has been perverted by   sin into the carnal pleasure we sinners get when others praise us   and when we think we are greater than others are. Jesus sees this   in his disciples and instead of destroying the whole distorted   thing, he describes a pathway on which it will be radically   transformed into something beautiful.        He says true greatness is not wanting to be first while others   are second and third and fourth, but true greatness is the   willingness to be last. And true greatness is not positioning   yourself so that others praise you, but true greatness is putting   yourself in a position to serve everyone--to be a blessing to as   many as you possibly can.        So Jesus doesn't condemn the quest for greatness. He radically   transforms it. Go ahead and pursue it, he says. But the path is   down, not up.        Take pastors, for example: the measure of true greatness is not   how many people come to his church or how many books he has   written, or how many conferences he speaks at, or how many   stations carry his radio program. The measure of true greatness is   to what degree has the impulse to self-exaltation been crucified?   How much heartfelt desire to serve others has there been? How much   readiness and willingness to decrease while others increase?        Beware how you measure greatness in the servants of the Lord.   Paul said, "Do not pronounce judgment before the time, until the   Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in   darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then every   man will receive his commendation from God" (1 Cor. 4:5; cf. Rom.   2:29).        That's the first thing Jesus says in this text. "If anyone   would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all." And   before he says the second he takes a child and puts him in the   circle of apostles. Verse 36: "And he took a child, and put him in   the midst of them; and taking him in his arms . . ."

   First he set the child in the midst of the group, and then he   picked up the child in his arms.        Now why did he do this? What does this action have to do with   the teaching on true greatness that Jesus just gave to the twelve   in verse 35?        The point is so clear that Jesus doesn't have to say it. The   point is that children are among the "all" of verse 35: "You must   be the servant of all . . ." For example, here's a child. I am   taking this child in my arms to show you that if you would be   great, if you would be first, you must be the servant of children.   You must take time for children. You must not look down on or   despise children. You must not say this is simply women's work. If   you would be great, you will not rule out nursery duty; you will   pray earnestly about teaching primaries; you will think hard about   leading a boys' club or girls' club; you will spend yourself in   the fight to overcome child-killing.        Why does Jesus illustrate his point about serving with a child?   The discussion wasn't about children. Why does Jesus bring them   in?        The answer is that there is no political payback in serving   children: they can't vote. And they don't give speeches about how   great is your helpfulness. In fact they pretty much take for   granted that you will take care of them. They don't make a big   deal out of the fact that you pour your life out for them. And so,   children prove, more clearly than any other kind of people,   whether you are truly great or not--whether you live to serve or   live to be praised. (Cf. Luke 14:13-14 for how the poor, the   maimed, the lame and the blind also prove this.)        Now comes the second thing Jesus said (v. 37), and it is   utterly unexpected. We might have expected him to pick up on his   point in verse 35 and apply it to children. Something like: "Now   here's a child. The person in our society that men don't serve.   The person men don't take the time for. The person you don't think   is worth your time. Well I am showing you that children are worth   your time. They are significant. When you receive one of them and   serve one of them you are serving a person just as valuable as the   emperor of Rome."        But that is not what Jesus says. Jesus turns the whole   discussion away from the value of the child to the value of God.   This is what is so different about Jesus and about the Bible--even   from many of our Christian child-advocates writing today. Jesus   says: "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and   whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me."        Two things are utterly crucial in caring for children. One: is   it done in Jesus name? "Whoever receives one such child in my name   . . ." Ministering to children in any way but in the name of   Jesus, does not fulfil the will of Jesus. And the second crucial   thing in caring for children is that we do it with a longing to   experience more of Jesus and more of the One who sent him, God the   Father. "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me   and whoever receives me receives not me but the One who sent   me."        Why does he say this? Why does he bring everything to a focus   on God and the value of receiving more of God? Do you ever want to   say to Jesus, "Lighten up! Does everything always have to be   theological?" The answer is yes, it does. For Jesus everything has   to do with God, or it is fundamentally distorted.        And if someone asks, What about the children? Aren't you   supposed to serve the children because of the children? Surely the   answer of Jesus here is this: you serve a child best when you   receive a child and care for a child and spend time with a child   and hold a child NOT in the name of the child, or in the name of   mankind or in the name of mercy or in the name of America's   future, but in the name of Jesus, the Son of the living God. And   you serve children best when you receive a child not merely   because your joy is first in the child, but first and finally in   God.        Why is this the best way to serve? Because the most important   blessing you can give to a child is the all-satisfying centrality   of God in life. And, believe me, this is caught more than taught.   And that's why you must serve them in this way, you would lead   them in this way.        Now put the two things Jesus said together. In verse 35 he   said: if you would be first you must be last of all and servant of   all (especially children). And in verse 37 he said: if you receive   a child in my name you receive God. In other words, when I call   you to be the servant of all, including children, I am not calling   you to some heroic self-sacrifice. I am calling you to stop   chasing the bubbles of man's praise and start pursuing God. Stop   trying to receive praise in the service of men and starting   receiving God in the service of children. What do you want? Do you   want the fleeting praise of mortal men? Or do you want God?        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
