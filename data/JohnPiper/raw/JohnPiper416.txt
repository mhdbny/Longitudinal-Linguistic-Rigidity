  September 18, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       Christ is hallowed in us when we hope in him    (1 Peter 3:13-17)        And who is there to harm you if you provezealous for      what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of      righteousness, you are blessed. And do not fear their      intimidation, and do not be troubled, but sanctify Christ as      Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to      everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is      in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good      conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered,      those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to      shame. For better, if God should will it so, that you suffer      for doing what is right rather than for doing what iswrong.         When we pray the Lord's prayer the first petition we make is,   "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name." The first   priority in the heart of Jesus is the name of his Father. And it   is the first priority of the followers of Jesus. We pray, first   and foremost, "Father, cause your name to be hallowed. In the   church, all over the world, work with sovereign power to bring   hearts to the place where they hallow your name."       That word "hallow" is the same word that Peter uses in verse 15   of this text when he says, "Sanctify Christ as Lord in your   hearts." Hallow Christ as Lord in your hearts. He is God-with-us.   He and the Father are one. Hallowing the name of God the Father   and hallowing God the Son are one.       But what does it mean to hallow or sanctify Christ as Lord? It   means regard him as the holiest being in the universe. Regard him   as unique, one of a kind, without peer or rival in purity and   rectitude and goodness. When the NIV says (in v. 15), "Set apart   Christ as Lord," I think it means, Put him in a category by   himself -- the highest place, the greatest value, the most supreme   treasure, the greatest admiration, the most cherished prize, the   one you esteem and honor and love the most out of all persons and   all things in the world.       Especially admire his lordship -- "Sanctify Christ as Lord."   Stand in awe of his lordship over the universe. Bow before his   sovereign rule. Tremble with joy and gladness at the majesty of   the Lord that says, "There is none who can deliver from my hand; I   work and who can hinder it?" (Is. 44:13). Hallowing is the kind of   honoring that you give to a great and wonderful and righteous   king. Sanctify Christ as Lord, as King.       Now what does hallowing, or sanctifying Christ as Lord have to   do with the other concerns of this text -- being zealous for doing   good; suffering if necessary for righteousness' sake; being   fearless and meek and reverent; giving a defense of our hope?       We can see the answer if we just read carefully verses 14b-15.   "Do not fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled, 15 but   sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts . . ." In other words   sanctifying Christ as Lord in your heart is the alternative to   fearing man. Don't fear man, sanctify Christ as Lord. So there is   something about fearlessness before the threats of men that honors   Christ as Lord. What is that? Why does fearlessness sanctify   Christ?       The answer is given when we keep reading. Verse 15: "Sanctify   Christ as Lord in your hearts, (How? By) always being ready to   make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the   hope that is in you." Sanctify Christ in your hearts, by giving a   credible defense of your hope. How is Christ sanctified or   hallowed by good defense of our hope? The answer seems to be that   he is that hope. He is the ground of it and the goal of it. When   our hope looks strong Christ the ground and goal of it looks   strong. So he is hallowed and honored when we show that our hope   is unshakable.       Now we can see the link between fearlessness and hallowing   Christ as Lord. Peter says (v. 14b-15a), "Do not fear their   intimidation, and do not be troubled, but sanctify Christ as Lord   in your hearts." Fearlessness sanctifies Christ as Lord. Why?   Because fearlessness shows that our hope is unshakable.   Fearlessness is a clear testimony that our hope is real. And since   Christ is the ground and the goal of our hope, fearlessness honors   him -- sanctifies him, hallows him, shows his unique worth and   strength in our lives.       So my conclusion is that this whole text is about hope and the   way it helps us hallow or sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts.   The ultimate issue in this text -- and in our lives -- is   sanctifying, hallowing, honoring Christ as Lord. The secondary   issue is the hope that this Lordship gives us with all its effects   that show the supremacy of Christ's worth.       I'll break it down into four points:       1. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a fearless   hope.    2. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a well-defended   hope.    3. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a meek hope.    4. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a zealous hope.       In other words the two cords that tie up the contents of this   text and hold it together are the cord of Christ's value and the   cord of our hope in him.       Don't miss the main point in all the details. The main point is   that Christ is sanctified in our hearts when he is central in our   hope. Or: Christ is hallowed in our hearts when our hearts are   hopeful in him.       Let this sink in a moment. When you get up in the morning and   think: Today the ultimate purpose of my life is to hallow the name   of God: Hallowed be thy name. The main reason I am alive today is   to show the value of Jesus to others. When you say that, will the   next feeling that rises in your heart be one of burden or one of   relief? Does the destiny to live for the hallowing of Christ's   name feel like weight or like wings?       We are right at the core of Christianity here. Make sure that   you get it for the sake of your soul and your joy. Christianity,   as we see again from this text is very Christ-exalting rather than   self-exalting. It's very different from the reading that one of   you gave me recently from a strategy workshop in your place of   employment. The reading is called, "My Declaration of Self-esteem"   and says, among other things,       "I am me. In all the world, there is no one else exactly like   me. Everything that comes out of me is authentically mine because   I alone chose it . . . I own me, and therefore I can engineer me   -- I am me, and I am OKAY." (Author: Virginia Satir)       There are many competing religions in the world today. But I   think this one is the main competitor with Christianity in   America. Christianity is Christ-exalting and this religion is   self-exalting. But which is a burden? Which gives you a weight to   bear and which gives you wings?       Peter says that the way to exalt Christ as Lord is to hope in   him. The beauty of Christianity, and what sets it apart from other   religions, even humanistic, secular, self-exalting ones, is that   Christianity offers a Savior whose glory and weightiness are   upheld by being hoped in. Christianity does not call us first to   work for God, but to hope in God's work for us -- that is first,   and that's the main thing. Christ is hallowed in us by our hoping   in him.       When you wake up in the morning and remember that your destiny   is to hallow the name of God, remember also that he is hallowed by   hope not harried labor. He is hallowed by your trusting him to   help you with your day. He is hallowed by childlike confidence   that he will keep his promises. The value of Christ is exhibited   first not by back-breaking toil but by banking your hope on him.   Christianity is first wings not weight.       On the other hand if I believed in this other religion -- that   I alone chose everything that comes out of me, that I can invent   new things within me, that I own me and can engineer me -- if I   believed in that religion, I would despair with the excruciating   weight it puts on me -- to clear my own conscience, forgive my own   sin, find my own meaning, uphold my own cause, carry my own   burdens, protect my own life, overcome my own fears, heal my own   wounds, secure my own future, comfort myself in my own death. What   a crushing weight this religion puts on the backs of our   countrymen today. And the only redemption offered in this   religion: the pitiful ceremony of repeating in front of the   damning mirror: You're OKAY. You're OKAY. You're OKAY. It's a hard   way to die.       So don't miss the main point: Biblical Christianity is a   Christ-exalting religion. And he is exalted by being trusted. He   is hallowed in us by our hoping in him. That is very good news.       Now just a brief word about our four sub-points.       1. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a fearless hope.       We have seen this in verses 14-15. "But even if you should   suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not   fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled, 15 but sanctify   Christ as Lord in your hearts." The promise of Christ in Matthew   5:10 is, "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness   sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." You can rejoice in   that day because your reward is great in heaven. That's your hope.   It is guaranteed by the honesty, and power of Christ.       So put you hope in his promise (v. 14a), be fearless before men   (v. 14b), and the result will be that you will sanctify Christ as   Lord in your heart -- you will show that Christ is valuable above   all this world. Hallow him by hoping in him -- fearlessly.       2. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a well-defended   hope.       Verse 15: "Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, &#91;by&#93;   always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to   give an account for the hope that is in you." Christ is not   honored by groundless hope. If someone says to me, "Why do you   hope in Christ for forgiveness and for help and for eternal joy,"   and I answer, "No good reason, I just grew up this way," Or: "It   seems like a good gamble," Or: "Everybody's got a religion, I   decided to choose Christianity" -- if I answer these ways, then   Christ is not sanctified in my heart. He is not hallowed and   honored. He is made to look the fool. We say he's our hope, but we   don't know why he's our hope. Christ is not honored by groundless   hope.       It was this text that caused me to write the second Appendix at   the end of Desiring God, "Is the Bible a Reliable Guide to Lasting   Joy?" In other words, Is there a defense for our hope? I commend   it to you. You do not have to be a scholar to give a defense of   your hope. This text in 1 Peter is written to people in the first   century most of whom probably could not even read.       I urge you not to run to a book but to run to your closet and   ask God with as much honesty as you can, Why do I believe in you?   Why do I count you as my hope and treasure? What is the basis of   my hope? Search your heart. Your answer may have to do with the   trustworthiness of the witnesses who wrote the New Testament, or   with the self-authenticating character and teaching of Jesus --   "No man ever taught like this man." Or it may have to do with the   meaning and sense that Christ gives to history and human life, or   it may relate to the evidence or the resurrection, the empty tomb   and the power of changed lives, or it may have to do with   fulfilled prophecy, or with the compelling light of the gospel of   the glory of Christ, and your personal encounter with the living   Christ. Whatever the answer, it must be your answer and not   somebody else's. Christ will be honored by a well-grounded hope.       3. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a meek hope.       Verse 15 at the end: "Give an account of the hope that is in   you, yet with gentleness (or meekness) and reverence." We have all   noticed in politicians, preachers, teachers, and maybe even in   ourselves that sometimes the less sure you are of your point the   more strident and loud you become in defending it. That's not   always the case, since the Bible says frequently that the prophets   and Jesus himself lifted up their voices and cried out the truth.       But we know that there is a serenity that comes with deep,   well-grounded, settled conviction. That is the kind of hope that   sanctifies Christ as Lord in our hearts. There is a calmness and   equanimity and tranquility that hallows the name of Christ by   showing his great rock-like stability in our lives.       4. Christ is sanctified or valued as Lord by a zealous hope.       At the beginning and the ending of this text Peter calls us to   be zealous for good deeds, even if it means suffering. Verse 13:   "Prove zealous for what is good." Verse 16: "They revile your good   behavior in Christ." Verse 17: "Better to suffer for doing what is   right."       It is clear that putting our hope in Christ does not make us   passive or inactive. If it would be good for us and for his glory,   Christ would make us inactive. But maximum joy is not obtained   through sloth and empty days. We all know that. When we bank our   hope on Christ and turn our future over to him, he doesn't go to   work instead of us, he goes to work inside of us. He doesn't give   us freedom from good deeds, he gives us freedom in good deeds.       Just as he takes the sting out of death, so he takes the   futility out of work. He calls us to "be steadfast, immovable,   always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor   is not in vain in the Lord" (1 Cor. 15:58). It is not futile. He   is behind it. He is in it. He is over it. He inspires it. He   sustains it. He will reward it. His yoke is easy and his burden is   light. Therefore being zealous for good deeds is the way we   experience most of Christ's suffering and find most satisfaction   in him. So a zealous hope shows the value of Christ.       The great central heartbeat of Christianity is that Jesus   Christ, the Savior and Lord, is exalted and hallowed and   sanctified by the happy hope that his people put in him. And he   shines all the brighter when our hope is fearless and   well-defended and meek and zealous for good deeds.       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
