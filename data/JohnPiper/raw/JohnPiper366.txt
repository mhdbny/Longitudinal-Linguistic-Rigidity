 November 29, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       LIVING IN THE SPIRIT AND IN THE BODY    FOR THE COMMON GOOD    (1 Corinthians 12:1-13)         Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not      want you to be unaware. You know that when you were pagans, you      were led astray to the dumb idols, however you were led.      Therefore I make known to you, that no one speaking by the      Spirit of God says, "Jesus is accursed"; and no one can say,      "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit. now there are      varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are      varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. And there are      varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in      all persons. But to each one is given the manifestation of the      Spirit for the common good. For to one is given the word of      wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge      according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same      Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, and      to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy,      and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another      various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of      tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things,      distributing to each one individually just as He wills. For      even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the      members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so      also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one      body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we      were all made to drink of one Spirit.                I think the main point of this passage is verse 7: "But to each   one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good."   There are four words I want us to look at.        The first is the phrase "each one." "To each one is given . .   ."--that's you, all of you who are Christians and each of you   individually.        Second, the word "Spirit." "To each one is given the   manifestation of the Spirit . . ."--that's God, the same God that   brooded over the waters of Genesis 1:2 and joined in the creation   of the universe.        Third, the word "manifestation." "To each one is given the   manifestation of the Spirit . . ."--that's the connection between   you and God. God is manifested in your life. God, the Spirit,   becomes visible through you. You are to show the Spirit. Professor   Don Carson of Trinity Seminary wrote a whole book on just these   three chapters (12-14) and he titled the whole book on the basis   of this one verse: "Showing the Spirit." To him that is what the   whole section is about. I would say that is what the whole Bible   and all of life is about--showing God, making God as seen as an   invisible God can be seen.        Fourth, the phrase "common good." "To each one is given the   manifestation of the Spirit for the common good." That's a result   of the manifestation of God the Spirit in the life of the   church--good comes to people. It is good for people to see God. It   is good for us to see the manifestations of God's Spirit in each   other's lives.        So here again we have one of the pillar convictions of our   ministry here at Bethlehem: the pursuit of God's glory (the   manifestation of God) and the pursuit of what is good for us are   not two separate pursuits. If you want to do good for people, you   manifest God to them. If you want to manifest God and make him   known, you do good to others, because that is the way he wills to   manifest himself. That is what he is like.        The church is the place where these two things come together.   The world often tries to do good for each other. But they leave   God out. And so they do some temporary good, but no ultimate,   eternal good. And some Christians try to experience God's   manifestations alone, but do not do it in the context of an   interdependent body, and so they may have some ecstatic   experiences, but they don't see God as he really is, because he is   the kind of God who manifests himself for the common good, not for   individualistic religious raptures.        So this verse (v. 7) is right at the heart of what it means to   be Christians individually, and what it means to be the church   corporately. So let's take these four words, one at a time, and   see what the context tells us about them, and about what we should   be at Bethlehem.         1. "Each one"          "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for   the common good."          Who are the "each ones" who are given the manifestation of the   Spirit? Are you included? That's what verses 2 and 3 are talking   about.        You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the   dumb idols, however you were led. Therefore I make known to you,   that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is   accursed"; and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy   Spirit.        Who then are the "each ones" in verse 7? They are those who   once were pagans led away from Christ by idols--idols that have   nothing to say. Dumb idols. Idols with no message, no good   news.        But all that has changed because of the work of the Spirit. The   "each ones" of verse 7 are people who have ceased treating Jesus   as a curse to be rejected and now follow him as Lord. So the   essence of who the "each ones" are is the Lordship of Jesus. The   key sentence is at the end of verse 3: "No one can say 'Jesus is   Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit." The "each ones" in verse 7 are   people who live under the lordship of Jesus--who aim to think the   way he says to think, and who aim to feel the way he says to feel   and who aim to do what he says to do. These are the people who   each have a manifestation of the Spirit, because they cannot live   like this "except by the Holy Spirit."        The reason I say that LIVING under the lordship of Jesus is the   mark of "each one" rather than just saying "Jesus is Lord" is that   Scripture and experience teach us that people can indeed say that   Jesus is Lord without the special work of the Holy Spirit in their   lives. For example in Matthew 7:22-23 Jesus says, "Many will say   to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,   and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many   miracles?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you;   depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'"        So you can see from those words that "practicing the lordship   of Jesus" is the issue, not just saying that he is Lord. That's   what Paul means in 1 Corinthians 12:3b, "No one can say, 'Jesus is   Lord' (and mean it) except by the Holy Spirit." So the "each ones"   of verse 7 are those who are so changed by the Holy Spirit that   they say it and mean it and live it: Jesus is Lord. He runs my   life. I consult with him. I don't do what he forbids and I do what   he commands. And when I fall short, I feel bad and I repent and   seek his forgiveness and press on to trust him and obey him more   and more fully.        And all this comes from the Spirit. It cannot be experienced   except by the Spirit of God. The Spirit's main business in the   world is to glorify Jesus and make his lordship real in people's   lives. Jesus said in John 16:14, "&#91;When the Spirit of truth   comes&#93; he will glorify me." Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3:18,   "We all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of   the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to   glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit." It is the Spirit that   changes us from one degree of glory to another in the likeness of   Jesus.        That's who the "each ones" are in verse 7--people who have set   their face to be like Jesus and follow him as Lord because the   Spirit is at work in them.         2. "The Spirit"          "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for   the common good."          If we looked at verse 13 we could talk about being baptized in   the Spirit (so that he is all around us, like water in baptism) or   we could talk about drinking the Spirit (so that he is in us   filling us and making us drunk with his holy influences).        But I just want us to look briefly at the major emphasis of   this passage summarized in verse 11: "But one and the same Spirit   works all these things, distributing to each one individually as   he wills." This verse emphasizes two things.        One is that there is one and the same Spirit behind all the   varieties of gifts. "One and the same Spirit works all these   things." Look at verse 4. "Now there are varieties of gifts, but   the same Spirit." Verse 5: "And there are varieties of ministries,   but the same Lord." Verse 6: "And there are varieties of effects,   but the same God." Verse 8 and 9: "For to one is given the word of   wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge   according to the same Spirit; to another, faith by the same   Spirit, and to another, gifts of healings by the one Spirit."        Paul clearly wants us to get the message: we are different in   our gifts and ministries and effectiveness, yes, no doubt about   it; but those differences are not owing to many Spirits, or to bad   faith or to poor obedience. They are owing to "one and the same   Spirit." Variety is owing to unity.        The other thing verse 11 emphasizes is that the Spirit is the   one who decides who will have what gift and ministry and   effectiveness. "One and the same Spirit works all these things,   distributing to each one individually just as He wills." The   Spirit who is in us and around us is also over us. He fills us and   embraces us and rules us.        The Spirit is sovereign. That's the point of verse 11: he does   what he wills. The diversity of gifts, the diversity of   ministries, the diversity of effectiveness is his doing. He is   God. He is the Spirit of the Father and the Spirit of the Son, and   their one divine will comes to expression perfectly in his. They   are one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And they build and rule   and guide the Church.         3. "Manifestation"          "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for   the common good."          The reason the Spirit gives the gifts and the ministries and   the effectiveness that he does is so that he will be manifested in   the church. A manifestation is a showing. When you manifest   something you bring it to light. You put it forward for people to   see.        Now this is a corrective for a truth that we sometimes   overstate. We say that, as I did at the beginning, that the   Spirit's main ministry is to glorify Jesus. That's implied in   verse 3: "No one can say Jesus is Lord, except by the Spirit." The   "Spirit's main business is to exalt the lordship of Jesus the Son   of God.        But we go too far when we say that the second person of the   Trinity is totally self-effacing--as if there were no honor and no   glory belonging to the Holy Spirit himself. Verse 7 says that the   gifts and ministries of believers in the church are manifestations   of the Spirit. They are meant to show the Spirit. They are meant   to make the Spirit visible. They are meant to make us admire and   love and submit to the Spirit.        But let me stress something else about the Spirit here. What   this verse is saying is that the work of the church is a   thoroughly supernatural work. One of the greatest curses on a   church is when its business is down to such a science that it   manifestly runs by human effort alone. In that case the verse   should read not: "To each one is given a manifestation of the   Spirit," but: "From each one is offered a manifestation of human   effort." If that's the main thing in a church, the efficiency of   man is glorified, not the sovereignty of the Spirit and the   Lordship of Jesus.        I rejoice when I see evidences of reliance on the Spirit again   and again at Bethlehem. We have much to learn, but I am encouraged   that the Spirit is manifesting himself among us. Whatever you do,   do it in the power of the Spirit that the Spirit might be seen   among us more and more.         4. "The common good."          "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for   the common good."          Finally, the Spirit is manifest for this purpose: the common   good. The Spirit does not give gifts and ministries so that we can   boast in our spiritual prowess. He gives gifts and ministries for   two reasons: to manifest himself and to help us do good to each   other in the church. Gifts are for the glory of God and the good   of the church.        This is right at the heart of our understanding of Biblical   theology: the pursuit of God's glory and the pursuit of what is   good for us are not two separate pursuits. If you want to do good   for people, you try to manifest God to them. If you want to   manifest God and make him known for who he really is, you make it   your aim to do good to others.        We close by offering you a very concrete opportunity to begin a   new habit of manifesting the Spirit and doing good to others. When   you leave we are going to give any of you that will make a promise   to use them this way a pack of three "A Word of Hope . . . from a   friend at Bethlehem" cards and three stamps. If you will promise   to pray about whom you should send them to, and then send them   before Christmas, you may have them as a gift.        It is simply a pump priming effort on our part to help you   become more intentional in fulfilling the call on your life in   verse 7: "To each one (of you here this morning) is given the   manifestation of the Spirit for the common good."        Words of hope are not the only gift we have to share for the   common good. But maybe if we fill Bethlehem with words of hope   from each other all the other means of doing good to each other   will increase as well.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
