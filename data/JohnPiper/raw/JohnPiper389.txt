       JOY THROUGH THE FIERY TEST OF GENUINE FAITH    (1 Peter 1:6-7)        In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a      little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various      trials, that the proof of your faith, being more precious than      gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be      found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation      of Jesus Christ;         
       Christianity is a life of painful joy. The Old Testament   commands us to delight ourselves in the Lord (Psalm 37:4) and to   serve the Lord with gladness (Psalm 100:2) and to rejoice before   the Lord our God in all our undertakings (Deuteronomy 12:18).       And the Jesus commands us, "Rejoice and leap for joy for your   reward is great in heaven" (Luke 6:23), and he tells us, "These   things I have spoken to you that my joy might be in you and your   joy might be full" (John 15:11).       The apostle Paul commands us, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and   again I say rejoice" (Philippians 4:4). He tells us that the fruit   of the Spirit is joy (Galatians 5:22). He says that he is a worker   with us for our joy (2 Corinthians 1:24) and that he lives for the   advancement and joy of our faith (Philippians 1:25), and that God   loves a cheerful giver.       And on and on. And so it is with the other writers of   Scripture. The message is: Christianity is a life of tremendous   and abiding joy.       Now Peter picks up this great theme in verse six and shows us   two great reasons for joy, and in the process, why it is painful   joy. The first one we have spent two weeks on already. The second   one is new in verses 6 and 7.        Two reasons why Christians can be joyful        1. The promise of a great future       Let me just remind you of the first reason since that's what   Peter does at the beginning of verse 6. He says, "In this you   greatly rejoice." The word "this" refers to the first reason for   great joy. It refers back to what we've seen in verses 3-5.       Verse 3: God caused us to be born again to a living hope   through the resurrection from the dead.       Verse 4: God is keeping an inheritance for us in heaven that   can't perish or soil or fade.       Verse 5: God is keeping us for that inheritance.       There's an inheritance and there's an inheritor. And the first   basis of our joy is that God is keeping both: he is keeping the   inheritance perfect for us; and he is keeping us in faith so that   we will in fact not make shipwreck of our faith and lose the   inheritance.       Then in verse 6 Peter says, "In THIS you greatly rejoice." The   first reason for our joy is the great future God promises us and   his unswerving commitment to keep it for us and us for it. In   other words, our joy is based on the happiness of our future with   God and the certainty that we will make it there. Christian joy is   almost synonymous with Christian hope. That's why Peter says in   verse 3 that we were born again into a living hope; then verses 4   and 5 describe the content of that hope; and then verse 6 begins,   "in THIS you rejoice." In this you have living, vital,   life-changing hope; and in this you rejoice. Our hope is our joy.       2. A design for our distresses       The second reason is that God has a design for our distresses   in this life. This is what verses 6 and 7 are about--God's design   for our distress.       But now don't misunderstand me. The second reason for joy is   essentially the same as the first one, namely, hope. But the   difference is this:       1) In verses 3-5 the point is that the inheritance is out there   waiting for us imperishable and unfading, and that we are being   kept for it, so that no matter what distresses we face we can look   beyond them to the sure future that is coming and take heart. It   is going to be worth it all.       2) In verses 6-7 the point is different: namely, that the   distresses themselves have a part in getting us ready to enjoy the   inheritance to the fullest possible measure. We don't just look   beyond the distresses to the sure hope; we look at God's design in   the distresses--and see how God is working the distresses together   for our good.       So Christianity is a life of tremendous joy first because we   have a great and fail-safe future to look forward to beyond all   our distresses, AND second because God has a design to increase   our joy in that future by means of all our distresses.       Let's look at this design in verses 6 and 7.       First, where do I get the idea that our distresses are designed   by God for our good?       I get it from the phrase "if necessary" in verse 6 and the word   "that" (or "so that") at the beginning of verse 7. Verse 6 says,   "In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while,   if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials." What   kind of necessity is this? Who or what is making the distress of   these trials "necessary"?       The answer is God. Peter makes it plain that Christian distress   only happens if God wills it. For example, in 3:17 he says, "It is   better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what   is right rather than for doing what is wrong." You might suffer   for doing what is right; you might not. The ultimate choice is   God's. "If God should will it so," we will or we won't. Or again   in 4:19 he says, "Let those also who suffer according to the will   of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is   right."       In other words, Peter is teaching that the sovereign will of   God governs all the distresses that happen to us and, therefore   the design in them is not ultimately the design of evil men or the   design of Satan (which are real enough!), but is a design of God.       So when Peter says in verse 6, "if necessary, you have been   distressed by various trials," he means, "If God deems it   necessary."       But why would God do that? This leads us to the word "that" or   "so that" at the beginning of verse 7. This gives the reason why   God would deem it necessary that we be distressed by various   trials: "that (or so that) the proof of your faith, being more   precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by   fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the   revelation of Jesus Christ."       What this verse does is spell out the design of our distresses.   The design is that our distresses would refine the genuineness of   our faith the way fire refines gold so that when Christ comes back   the quality of our faith would win praise and glory and honor.       So there is a design in your distresses as a Christian. God   wills them, and he does so for your good.       Now I know that this raises a painful and troubling question.   We are not playing games here. We are talking about your and my   real life this very day. Does God will the break up of your   marriage? Does God will your cancer, your homosexual orientation,   the rebellion of your child, the loss of your job, the threatening   chaos in Russia and Congo and Somalia and Guinea? I will give you   my answer, which I believe to be the Biblical one, based on texts   like 1 Peter 3:17 and 4:19.       The answer is No, God does not will it, and Yes, he does. No,   in the sense that he does not delight in pain for its own sake; he   does not command sin or approve of sinning. But Yes, he does will   that these things be, in the sense that he could prevent any of   those things but sometimes does not, but rather guides them,   because of higher designs than the destructiveness of sin or the   deceitfulness of Satan or the painfulness of suffering.       When Christians suffer for doing right, sin is happening to   them. But 1 Peter 3:17 says that sometimes God wills that this   happen. He does not endorse or approve sinning, but he can and   does will that sinful acts come about for his own holy designs.   When Christ was murdered on the cross, it was sin, but God willed   that it happen: "It was the will of the Lord to bruise him"   (Isaiah 53:10). And by that will we are saved.        Five elements of God's design in our   distresses        Now if there is a divine design in our distresses, we must ask   what that is. Because knowing this is a means of tremendous joy in   and through our distresses.       Peter mentions at least five elements of God's design in our   distresses.       1. In God's design, our distresses are made up of various   trials.       Verse 6b: "if necessary, you have been distressed by various   trials." The NIV says "all kinds of trials." The point is that the   variety of ways that we experience distress is great. So in God's   design it is "necessary," he says, to use a wide range of trials.   There is not just one kind of trial in view here. God paints with   many colors. Many dark and many bright. And in the end the canvas   of your life will be glorious, if you entrust your soul to a   faithful Creator (4:19).       2. In God's design, my distresses are brief.       Verse 6 again: "In this you greatly rejoice, even though now   for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by   various trials." Brief is very relative, isn't it. If you say, "He   can hold his breath a long time," you mean two or three minutes.   That's long for breath-holding. But if you say, "He's been a   pastor of the church for a long time, you mean perhaps 15 or 20   years.       So it is with the phrase "little while" in this verse. Compared   to others and compared to a lifetime on earth, your distresses may   last a long time not a little. But compared to eternity-- compared   to the inheritance imperishable, undefiled, unfading kept in   heaven for you--they are only for a little time. Peter shares   James' perspective on this life: "You are just a vapor that   appears for a little while and then vanishes away" (James 4:14).   Compared to the length and greatness of the future God has planned   for you, all the distresses of this life are very little in deed   (cf. 5:10).       3. In God's design, our trials are grievous.       They are distresses. The word in verse 6, ("you have been   distressed by various trials") means grieved, sorrowed. Mark this   well. It's not double talk when Peter says, "In this you are   rejoicing, though now for a little while in this life you are   grieved." You are rejoicing though you are grieved. We know this   is not a mistake, because Paul said he experienced this very   thing. In 2 Corinthians 6:10 he says he lives "as sorrowful (same   word) yet always rejoicing."       In God's design for our trials there is a place for real,   authentic grieving and distress. But this experience is   fundamentally altered from the way the world experiences these   things. We see a design in it all. And so our root stays planted   even though the branches thrash in the wind. And the leaves remain   green and the fruit keeps growing because our roots go down by the   stream of God's sovereign grace--and we trust him for a good   design.       4. In God's design, our distresses are like the fire that   refines gold from its impurities.       Verse 7: "that the proof (or genuineness) of your faith, being   more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by   fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the   revelation of Jesus Christ."       When gold is melted in the fire the impurities float to the top   and can be removed. When the refining fire is over, the gold is   even more valuable. So it is with your faith in God. You have   faith. You trust his promises. But there are impurities in it.   There are elements of murmuring and pessimism (I speak from   painful experience). And there are tendencies to trust money and   position and popularity, along side God--dirt mingled with the   gold of faith.       These impurities in our faith hinder our fullest experience of   the goodness and greatness of God. So God designs to refine our   faith with the fires of trial and distress. His aim is that our   faith be more pure and more genuine. That is, that it be more   utterly dependent on him and not on things and other persons for   our joy.       One of the best illustrations of how this works comes from the   experience the apostle Paul. In 2 Corinthians 1:8-9 Paul described   this very refining design of God in his distress. "We do not want   you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in   Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so   that we despaired even of life (that's the fire); indeed, we had   the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not   trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead" (that's the   gold).       God took away from Paul an ordinary prop of safety and let him   feel an almost overwhelming sense of human abandonment. This was   the fire of 1 Peter 1:7. Not because God didn't love Paul. But   because God saw Paul's faith as gold worthy of refining.       5. Finally, in God's design, the result of this refining is   that our faith will receive praise and honor and glory.       Verse 7: "that the proof of your faith . . . may be found to   result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus   Christ."       When Jesus appears in glory two things are going to happen. His   glory will be magnificently reflected in the mirror of our faith.   He will be the trusted one and the hoped-for one and the   rejoiced-in one. So his glory will shine in our faith and hope and   joy. And the more pure and refined the gold of our faith, the more   clearly his beauty and worth will be reflected.       But since God exalts all that exalts him, he will give praise   and honor and glory to our faith. He will say, "Well done, good   and faithful servant." He will give us (as Peter says in 5:4) "the   unfading crown of glory" (cf. 1 Cor. 4:5).       And we will see finally that the design of God in our distress   has been the extraordinary joy of sharing in the very glory and   praise and honor of God himself.
