  April 27, 1986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning John Piper, preaching Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   HOW CAN I HOPE? NEW BIRTH!  I Peter 1:3, 22-25  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercywe have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of JesusChrist from the dead... Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere loveof the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart. You have beenborn anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the livingand abiding word of God; for..        All flesh is like grass       and all its glory like the flower of grass.       The grass withers, and the flower falls,       but the word of the Lord abides for ever.       That word is the good news which was preached to you.  Let's begin by reviewing the first three messages in this series on hope,so that we can see how todays message fits with the others. The first question we asked was, What is hope? And the main point (takenfrom Hebrews 6:11) was that Biblical hope is full assurance not uncertaindesire. It's not the hope my sons speak of when they say, "I hope daddy getshome for supper on time." I may very well not! That is what they mean byhope! But that is NOT what the Bible means! When Psalm 42:5 says, "Hope in God!" It does not mean, cross your fingers.It does not mean, God might work for his servant. It means, be confidentthat He will! Be strong in God! Be courageous in God! Preach to your soula sermon about the full assurance of hope! Do what I did last Thursday. I preached my soul a sermon on Psalm 35:27.It says, "Great is the Lord, who delights in the welfare of his servant."So I said, "Soul, be glad today! Be strong! Look, do you see the greatnessof the Lord God Almighty? Do you see the power of the Maker of heaven andearth? Do you see the wisdom and the knowledge of the one who designed theuniverse and the molecule? "Well, hear this and be astounded, little soul: that great God delights inyour welfare! Did you hear that, little soul. I said, 'Delights'! That'sD-E-L-I-G-H-T-S, DELIGHTS! Your welfare is not his duty; its his joy! 'Greatis the Lord, who delights in the welfare of his servant!' So hope in Godand don't be downcast.'" Biblical hope is not an uncertain desire. It is a confident expectation. The next question we asked was, why we hope. If someone asks you a reasonfor the hope that is in you, what should you say? The first answer was GRACE!God loved us and gave us "good hope through grace" (2 Thessalonians 2:16). We defined grace from Romans 11:5-6. "There is at the present time a remnant,according to the election of grace. But if it is by grace, it is not on thebasis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace." So grace is God'sdisposition to choose and bless his people without respect to their works.It is God's free goodness toward people who have no rightful claim on himat all. And then we just followed the track of our salvation layed out for us in2 Thessalonians 2:13-14. We were chosen by grace, called by grace, broughtto faith by grace, sanctified by grace, and will be glorified by grace. Therefore, the great spring and fountain of all our hope is the free andsovereign grace of God. But last week we emphasized that the grace of God does not just sweep sinunder the rug in order to give hope to sinners. Grace moves God to send hisdivine Son Jesus Christ (by whom and for whom all things were created!) intothe world to die for sinners and to rise from the dead as the head over anew reconciled humanity. And so grace creates gospel -- the good news thatChrist died for sinners, rose again the third day and that "everyone whobelieves in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name" (Acts 10:43).Grace gives hope by creating the gospel. So if the fountain and spring of all our hope is the grace of God, then thechannel through which the river of grace flows is the gospel, and our hopeis "the hope of the gospel" (Colossians 1:23). Or we can change the image to help us move into today's message. Let's saythat grace is the eagerness of a world class heart surgeon to save the livesof desperately ill heart patients. Grace is his willingness and eagernessto heal. And let's say that the gospel is the new surgical instrument thatthis doctor developed on Good Friday and Easter. Let's call the death andresurrection of Jesus God's invention of a surgical instrument, the gospel. But as far as the patient is concerned something is still missing. The doctoris eager to heal (that's grace), the surgical instrument is prepared andin his hand (that's the gospel), but if something else doesn't happen thepatient is going to die of heart disease--of a sinful nature. If somethingelse doesn't happen, there will be no hope. And that is what we want to talk about today -- the actual surgery callednew birth. Along with the willingness of the doctor to heal and the preparationof the surgical instrument, there has to be the operation. The chest mustbe opened. The disease must be cut out. The blockages have to be removed. This is tremendously important, because you can believe that the surgeonis eager, and you can believe that the surgical instrument is effective,and still die of heart disease. To get well from the disease of sin, andto have a living hope, you have to undergo the surgery itself. The eagernessof the surgeon and the effectiveness of the surgical instrument have to goto work on you, and make your heart new. We call that the new birth. Withoutit there is no hope of eternal life. Let's see this in 1 Peter 1. Peter makes the connections between grace, gospel,hope and new birth very clear. First notice verse 3: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercywe have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of JesusChrist from the dead. Here we have the doctor's eagerness, the surgical instrument, the surgeryitself and the healed condition of living hope. Peter writes, "By [God's] great mercy" -- that's the doctor's eagerness.I think mercy here is virtually the same as grace. The spring and fountainof our hope is the heart of God and it is a heart of mercy -- Peter says,"GREAT mercy." "By his great mercy, he begot us anew." Then there is the surgical instrument. "We have been born anew to a livinghope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." So the resurrectionof Jesus is the surgical instrument. Through it we have been born anew. Butto get a clear idea of how Peter is thinking here we need to look at verse23. There he describes the surgical instrument a bit differently. He says, You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, throughthe living and abiding word of God. The word of God is the surgical instrument in this verse. What word is that?Verse 25 tells us: "That word is the good news which was preached to you."The surgical instrument is the gospel -- the good news that was preachedto you. So how do we put the surgical instrument of verse 3 and the surgical instrumentof verse 23 together? Are they two different instruments or one? Verse threesays, born anew through the instrument of the resurrection of Jesus. Verse23 says, born anew through the word of God the gospel that was preached toyou. This is really one surgical instrument. Remember that the gospel is the messageof Christ's death and resurrection for sinners. You can't have a gospel messagewithout a resurrection to proclaim. So the resurrection is essential to gospelproclamation. Yes, but the resurrection wouldn't be gospel unless it were proclaimed. Theresurrection would not beget hope in anybody if it were kept secret. Youhave to have the event itself and you have to have the announcement of theevent. So I would say that there is just one surgical instrument, but youcan describe it two ways. You can say that the surgical instrument of our healing is the resurrectionof Jesus preached as good news to sinners; or you can say that the surgicalinstrument is the preaching of the resurrection of Jesus as good news forsinners. You can call it the resurrection preached, or the preaching of theresurrection. But there is really just one instrument that is used by thesurgeon to save us from our heart's disease. That's why verse 3 says, bornanew through the resurrection; and verse 23 says, born anew through the wordof God, the gospel which was preached to you. So far then we have seen in verse 3 the eagerness of the surgeon called mercy(or grace) -- "By his great mercy..." -- and we have seen the surgical instrument-- the resurrection preached in the gospel. Now, in the third place, we seethe surgery itself. The chest is opened, the disease is removed, and theheart is made new with a living hope. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercywe have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of JesusChrist from the dead. We have been born anew. Or literally, he caused us to be born anew -- hehas begotten us anew. That's the life-giving surgery. Let's meditate on itfor a moment. And in meditating on it let's learn the word "regeneration". This is a biblicalword. It is used in the KJV in Matthew 19:28 and Titus 3:5. It simply means"new birth" or "rebirth". To generate is to give birth to, to regenerateis to give birth to again. Let's build this rich word into our worship andprayer vocabulary. Let's know what I mean when I pray, "Lord make your wordtoday the occasion and instrument of your regenerating work!" Three observations: 1. Regeneration is necessary, not optional. 2. Regeneration is a work of God, not man. 3. God regenerates through his word, not without it.  1. Regeneration is necessary, not optional. Jesus said to Nicodemus in John 3:3, "Truly, truly I say to you, except aman be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven." This is what I meanwhen I say that regeneration is a necessary work. Without it you will neversee the kingdom of heaven. Why? Because Jesus said in John 3:6-7, That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spiritis spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, "You must be born again." In other words, the reason we must be born again is that mere flesh doesnot inherit the kingdom of heaven, and all we are is flesh until we are bornagain by the Spirit. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." If thereis going to be a spiritual life in us, it must be born of the Spirit. Thereforeyou must be born of the Spirit. Before new birth by the Spirit of God, thereis no spiritual life in us; we are simply flesh. We are natural not spiritual. And therefore we are utterly without hope in ourselves. Because Paul saysin 1 Corinthians 2:14 that the natural man (the man who is just flesh) doesnot welcome the things of the Spirit of God because they are folly to him,and he is not able to know them because they are spiritually appraised. And in another place he says, The mind of the flesh is enmity toward God, for it does not submit to thelaw of God, for it cannot. And those who are in the flesh can not pleaseGod. (Romans 8:7-8) But before regeneration that is all we are is flesh. It can mask itself inreligion or flaunt itself in immorality, but at root it is independence fromGod and enmity toward God and callousness toward all that is truly spiritual.That will not enter the kingdom of heaven. That is what we all are by nature.Therefore we must be born again -- Regeneration is necessary, not optional.  2. Regeneration is a work of God, not man. The text says this plainly, "Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord JesusChrist, who by his great mercy has begotten us anew." God is the surgeonhere not man. Here the image of the surgeon has to give way to one that makes this truthmore vivid. God is not a surgeon--God is not even an obstetrician in thework of new birth. He is a father. He does not deliver a baby. He begetsan embryo. Verse 23 says, "You have been born anew not of perishable seedbut of imperishable." The doctor does not plant the seed. The father does. God does not come on the scene when this embryo is well-formed in the wombwith all its chromozomes fixed. O no! When God comes on the scene, thereis no spiritual embryo. And by the miracle of generation, God fathers life.He does not deliver man-made life like an obstetrician. He begets, God-madelife like a father. Therefore John says that when we are born again God's seed abides in us (1John 3:9). And Peter says that we are partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter1:4), like a child has the traits of his father. Regeneration is a work of God, not man. Jesus stresses the freedom of theSpirit of God in this work when he says, (in John 3:8), The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do notknow whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is bornof the Spirit. The point of that saying is to stress the sovereign freedom of God in thework of regeneration. The wind of the Spirit blows where it wills, not wherewe will. Therefore John says in John 1:13 that we were born not of bloodnor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. Regeneration is God's work, not man's. O, do you know what it means to be a Christian? Do you stand amazed andspeechless that you are a Christian? Do you look back with wonder and aweat the miracle of your new birth? Or do you take so much credit for it yourselfthat it doesn't occur to you to fall on your face and thank God that youare a Christian? Think on it! If you have any truly spiritual desire for God it is owing tothe work of God in regeneration. If you have any love for holiness it isowing to the work of God in regeneration. If you have any hatred for sinit is owing to the work of God in regeneration. If you have a mustard seedof faith in Christ it is owing to the work of God in regeneration. To Godbe the glory for our conversion to Christ! Consider and be astounded, allyou who by nature are children of wrath, that you believe in Christ and arenew children of the Almighty. Regeneration is a glorious work of God, not man.  3. God regenerates through his word not without it. This we have seen already, so I will only point to it briefly in 1 Peter1:23 and pass on to our final consideration. Peter says, You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, throughthe living and abiding word of God. The Spirit blows where it wills, Jesus said. But it never wills to blow withoutthe gospel. You might say that the Spirit is like the wind that blows theseed of the gospel onto the soil of man's heart, and makes it come to life. Look at 1 Peter 1:12. It was revealed to them (the prophets of the OT) that they were serving notthemselves but you, in the things which have now been announced to you bythose who preached the good news to you through the Holy Spirit sent fromheaven. How was the gospel preached? It was preached through the Spirit. It is theSpirit that carries the gospel and gives it regenerating power. So regeneration is necessary not optional. It is a work of God not man. AndGod, the Spirit, regenerates through his word and not without it. That leads us to our final consideration. Why does God only cause new birthin the presence of the gospel? Answer: because the aim of new birth is tocreate hope in the heart of sinners, and if there were no gospel there wouldbe no message in which to hope. Look at verse 3 one last time.        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!       By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope!  The goal of God in the work of regeneration is to create in our heart a livinghope. "Born anew unto a living hope." But if God's aim in regeneration isto beget a new little babe who hopes in the mercy of God, then God must havea hopeful message ready for that little babe to believe when he's born. Andthat message is the good news that Jesus died and rose again for the salvationof sinners. It would be contrary to the wisdom of God for him to beget a child of hopeand give them no gospel to hope in. So God has ordained that he will alwaysunite the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit with the preaching of thegospel. I close with one last reference to the nature of the gospel. In 1 Peter 4:17it says, for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; andif it begins with us, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospelof God? When it says that some do not obey the gospel of God, it teaches us thatthe gospel has a command has well as a promise. The command to everyone inthis room this morning is repent, turn from your sin and set your hope fullyon Jesus Christ. The promise is that your sins will be forgiven and you willenter into the kingdom of heaven. If someone asked me this morning, "How do you know that you were born?" Iwould not reach for a birth certificate and argue that a doctor signed iton January 11, 1946 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. I would say, I know I wasborn because I see and hear and feel and I get hungry and I breathe. I amalive! And so if someone asks you today (or if you ask yourself!), have you beenborn again, what will you say? How can you know? You know whether you havebeen born the second time (born of the Spirit) the same way you know whetheryou were born the first time. Do you see the truth of beauty of the gospel?Do you hear the voice of God in the gospel? Do you feel the need to repentand be forgiven? Are you hungry for the milk of God's word (2:2)? Are youbreathing the air of grace? Are you alive with hope in the promises of God?A living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead! Amen.
