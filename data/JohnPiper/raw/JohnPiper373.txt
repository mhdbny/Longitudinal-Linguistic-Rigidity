       ADVANCING AND SUSTAINING THE COVENANT COMMUNITY    (1 Thessalonians 3:11 - 4:2)        Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our      Lord direct our way to you; and may the Lord cause you to      increase and abound in love for one another, and for all men,      just as we also do for you; so that He may establish your      hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the      coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints. Finally then,      brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as      you received from us instruction as to how you ought to walk      and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you may      excel still more. For you know what commandments we gave you by      the authority of the Lord Jesus.         
       Let me begin this morning by putting this series on the church   covenant in a wider context of American culture.       Up till now we have stressed that local churches like ours come   into being and get their meaning from a covenant that believers   make with each other, and that this covenant with each other is   rooted in the new covenant that God made with his people through   the death of Jesus. God says in this covenant: "I will be their   God and they will be my people" (Hebrews 8:10). What this means is   that the divine covenant creates a human community. The commitment   God makes to us in the new covenant creates and shapes the   commitment we make to each other in the church covenant.       In other words, up till now our focus has been on how the   church covenant relates to God and takes its origin and its   character from him and his covenant with us.       But for just a moment now I want to relate the church covenant   to American culture. I don't know if you feel this or if you are   aware of it in any way, but what we are focussing on in these days   in calling each other to serious, practical reaffirmation of life   together in covenant is very counter-cultural. But we are not   unique in recognizing this.       In 1985 Robert Bellah, Professor of Sociology at the University   of California at Berkeley, published with several others a very   popular book called  Habits of the Heart.  It was a study   in American individualism and a warning that the loss of ideals   like commitment, community and covenant will be the undoing of   America.       He took his start from a Frenchman named Alexis de Tocqueville   who came and described America 160 years ago like this:       Such folk owe no man anything and hardly expect      anything from anybody. They form the habit of thinking of      themselves in isolation and imagine that their whole destiny is      in their own hands. 1         Thus, not only does democracy make men forget their ancestors,   but also clouds their view of their descendants and isolates them   from their contemporaries. Each man is forever thrown back on   himself alone, and their is danger that he may be shut up in the   solitude of his own heart.       Bellah argues that this is even more true of Americans today   than 160 years ago. He says,       Individualism narrows our concern to our own immediate      problems, often cutting us off from our own past as well as the      history of our society. The languages of      individualism--&#91;both the&#93; utilitarian      &#91;individualism of Ben Franklin, disconnected from Christian      faith, or even objective moral reason&#93; and &#91;the&#93;      expressive &#91;individualism of Walt Whitman whose famous poem      begins, "I celebrate myself, and sing myself"--both of these      kinds of individualism in America&#93; . . . are impoverished      vehicles for public discussion because they focus on immediate      payoff or inner feelings. They do not help us think about the      traditions that have formed us or about the larger problems of      our society...The mono-culture of the mass media is couched      largely in utilitarian and expressive form &#91;of      individualism&#93;. It is oriented to our immediate wants,      desires, and emotions. Television, for example, is much more      effective in transmitting powerful images and emotional      reactions than in stimulating careful and rational      discussion... 2         Bellah thinks this development of utilitarian and expressive   individualism in America is tragic and dangerous. It's not   surprising that his earlier book in 1975 was called The Broken   Covenant, because he thinks that the concept of covenant and   community and commitment to the wider common good is essential if   America and its "institutions of liberty" are going to survive.   And he is not the only one who is saying such things.       Now my point in connecting our focus on the church covenant   with the peril of American individualism is not to justify our   focus as part of America's salvation. Our church covenant is   justified by God in Jesus Christ and will be valid whether America   stands or falls. America is not God's main commitment. The glory   of God is God's main commitment. If America sinks into   individualistic anarchy where everybody does what's right in his   own eyes, God will still be Lord of the nations; his purposes will   be on track; and his people, who live for his glory and not for   any finite, narrow nationalistic cause, will endure to all   generations.       My point in making the connections with American individualism   is to wake us up to the fact that the whole idea of covenant and   mutual commitment is counter-cultural and, to the degree that we   have all been influenced by our culture, might feel strange or   un-american , and for many, therefore, exhilarating and liberating   and strengthening and stabilizing in a world turned upside down   and falling apart. And secondly the aim is to show that this need   for covenant relationships and stable community commitments is so   deep in the human heart that even outside the church in America   there is a rising tide of urgency and hope that we may as a people   discover this before it is too late.       As a Biblical foundation for paragraph two in our Church   Covenant consider three brief points from today's text in 1   Thessalonians. This paragraph of the covenant focuses on walking   together in love and advancing and sustaining the holiness and   mission of the covenant community.       The first point is that the central requirement of love in the   new covenant community is both a gift and a command. Notice in   3:12 Paul prays (in the form of a benediction), "May the Lord   cause you to increase and abound in love for one another and for   all men." Our life together originates in the covenant love of God   and so one essential mark of our covenant relationships in church   is love. And this love is the work of God. "May the Lord cause you   to increase and abound in love."       This is exactly the way we expect Paul to pray for new covenant   blessings because the new covenant (as we have seen in the last   two weeks) says, "I will write my law on their hearts . . . and I   will circumcise their hearts to love me . . . and I will put my   Spirit within them and cause them to walk in my statutes"   (Jeremiah 31:33; Deuteronomy 30:6; Ezekiel 36:27). So here Paul   says: you promised to do this in the new covenant; so I pray that   you will now do it: "Cause them to increase and abound in love."   So the covenant requirement of love is first and foremost a gift   in the new covenant.       But it is also a command. Look at 4:1-2,        Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you      in the Lord Jesus &#91;not merely pray for you&#93;, that, as      you received from us instruction as to how you ought to walk      and please God (just as you actually do walk &#91;namely, to      love each other&#93;), that you may excel still more. For you      know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord      Jesus &#91;not just what gifts God gave you by divine      enabling&#93;.         So the requirements of the new covenant are both gift and   command. And the command rests on the gift, as we know from the   logic of Philippians 2:12-13, "Work out your salvation with fear   and trembling &#91;that's the command&#93;, for it is God who is   at work in you to will and to do his good pleasure &#91;that's the   gift&#93;.       So the first point is that the pervasive adhesive of love that   binds the our church together in covenant is a sovereign work of   God so that he will get the glory (1 Peter 4:11), and he brings   this about through the engagement of the will of his people in   commandments.       You see this unity of divine working with human engagement in   the first line of paragraph two in the covenant: "We engage,   therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit . . ." Behind all the   engagements of our promising and our willing is the aid of the   Holy Spirit--the working of God. The requirement of love is both   gift and command.       The second point from the text is that this God-wrought love is   the essence of holiness. God's covenant people are called to be a   holy people--"You shall be holy for I am holy" (1 Peter 1:15-16).   And our covenant says we will strive for the advancement of this   church in holiness. But holiness is not something other than love.       Look at the connection between 3:12 and 3:13.        12) May the Lord cause you to increase and abound      in love for one another, and for all men, just as we also do      for you; 13) so that he may establish your hearts unblamable in      holiness . . .         If God causes them to abound in love they will have the   holiness they need to meet the Lord. I infer from this that love   is the essence of holiness. And that means then that the covenant   requirement of holiness is also a gift as well as a command,   because the love that is the heart of holiness is a gift and a   command. Paul wants the church to be holy and so he prays: Lord   cause them to abound in love so that they will be holy. You have   promised in the new covenant to write your holy law on our hearts.   You have promised in the new covenant to give us the Spirit and   cause us to walk in your holy statutes. So Lord do it now, and do   it by making love increase and abound.       Which leads to the final point from the text, namely, that the   new covenant community in this fallen world is not a perfect   community, not a completed community, but a community growing and   advancing toward perfection. Look again at 3:12, "May the Lord   cause you to increase and abound in love." If our love were   perfect or complete there would be no room for increase. But Paul   prays for increase.       This means that the new covenant community is a pilgrim   community. We have been saved from condemnation and transferred   from death to life and from darkness to light and from the   dominion of darkness to the kingdom of God's Son, but in this new   relation to God we are not yet perfected or completed, but are on   the way to becoming what we ought to be.       All of this is the Biblical foundation especially for paragraph   two in our Church Covenant, but also for the others as well. The   first commitment of the covenant is love. In a sense all else is   an unfolding of that. And the commitment of love and holiness is   not a static one, as though any of us had arrived, but a   commitment to strive forward and advance and promote and sustain.       I will close by reading the paragraph and in the coming two   weeks we will take up more of the details.       (2) We engage, therefore, by the aid of the Holy      Spirit, to walk together in Christian love, to strive for the      advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness and comfort;      to promote its prosperity and spirituality; to sustain its      worship, ordinances, discipline and doctrines; to contribute      cheerfully and regularly to the support of the ministry, the      expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread      of the Gospel through all nations.        Will you pray with me in these days the way Paul prayed in 1   Thessalonians 3:12--that God himself will cause us to love like   that? Then not only will be faithful in our covenant commitments   to God and to each other. But we will in a radically   counter-cultural way bear witness to the kind of communal,   committed, covenant life that America needs to see so badly.

The word "engage" goes back to the beginning of the use of   covenants in this country. For example, The Church Covenant of the   First Baptist Church of Boston written in 1665 began like this:       The 28 day of the 3d Mo. 1665 in Charlestown &#91;Boston&#93;,   Massachusetts, the Church of Christ commonly (though falsely)   called Anabaptists were gathered together and entered into   fellowship and communion each with other; engaging to walk   together in all the appointments of their Lord and Master the Lord   Jesus Christ as far as he should be pleased to make known his mind   and will unto them, by his word and spirit.       The word "engage" was probably synonymous with pledge. An old   meaning of the word "gage" is "pledge." To "engage" was thus to   take a pledge. This meaning is seen most clearly today in the noun   "engagement" between a man and a woman who solemnize the   "engagement" with a ring and with a statement of intention and   purpose. It also implies the engagement of the mind and will to   pursue intentionally the stipulations of the covenant.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
