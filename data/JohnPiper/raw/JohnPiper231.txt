 March 26, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    Easter Sunday A.M.    John Piper, Pastor            IRREVOCABLE JOY       "You have sorrow now,    but I will see you again    and your hearts will rejoice,    and no one will take your joy from you."    John 16:22            I want you to leave this morning with these words of Jesus ringing   in your ears: "No one will take your joy from you." I want you to   see them for yourselves. Do you see them at the end of verse 22?   "I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one   will take your joy from you." I want you to hear them not as the   words of man but as the words of God. I did not make them up to   make you feel good. I just read them out of God's word. If they   make you feel good that's God's idea, not just mine. "No one will   take your joy from you." This is the promise of irrevocable   joy.        Noel and I went downtown for a special Valentine's Day dinner   last February 14. It was one of the many dates I have botched over   the twenty years of our marriage. The restaurant I had chosen   especially for her was closed. It was cold as we walked around   trying to find another one. We wound up at a fast food place in   the center of the city sitting by a window overlooking 8th   Street.        We sat there looking around at this great city. The street was   dark and almost deserted. There was trash in the gutter. The   little street level shops seemed worn and chintzy. The few people   walking around gave the appearance that made you wonder whether   more cocaine might be sold that night than chow mein and egg   rolls.        The glitzy hotel facades looked pretty weak against the   darkness -- like they were hoping against hope that rich people   would want to come down and spend some time here. The magnificent   new lighting of the Norwest Bank building that gives a fairyland   flavor to the Minneapolis skyline, sheds no light on the streets   beneath. The doors were locked.        I got the eerie feeling that this exploding downtown, this   urban pearl and pride of the upper Midwest, with all its upscale   shops and classy hotels and stunning skyscrapers is built on sand.   I got the sinking feeling in my stomach that the millions and   millions of dollars that have been poured into downtown   Minneapolis could, with just the slightest turn of popular   displeasure become a billion dollar boondoggle -- a dark, sleazy,   dirty downtown slum where nobody wants to be.        I mention this just to illustrate how even the big enterprises   of our life and culture are very fragile. We plan and we save and   we build, and things look good and successful, and then it starts   to collapse. And we can't believe it. Nobody comes to shop. Nobody   rents the office space. Retailers begin to leave. The streets are   deserted. The hotels can't pull the conventions. Restaurants   close. The pushers move in. The gangs take over. And pretty soon   the unthinkable has happened. The pearl is ruined. The   Timberwolves don't stay. The new convention center can't fill its   schedule. And all that's left is cheap sleaze and empty   buildings.        It has happened elsewhere. It could happen here. And it can   happen in your own life. We are very fragile. Not much is sure and   firm and solid in our lives. That's why this word from Jesus is   very precious to me. "No one will take your joy from you." You've   heard of unconditional guarantees -- warranties that seem too good   to be true? Have you ever heard of any product that says: "In this   you will find pleasure and no one will take your pleasure from   you"? If you read that on some box or bottle you would smirk and   call it marketing ballyhoo.        But that's what Jesus says. Minneapolis may come "a-tumblin'   down" and all the money be lost and the dreams be dashed, but, "No   one will take your joy from you." How can this be? How can such a   massive claim stand when the biggest things in our world are   utterly uncertain and unstable? Let's look at these words to make   sure we understand them and how it can be that Jesus can guarantee   our joy with such amazing absoluteness: "No one will take your joy   from you."        Jesus is speaking to his disciples on the night before he was   killed. He is trying to help them understand what is just in front   of them. So in verse 16 he says, "A little while, and you will see   me no more; again a little while, and you will see me." The   disciples are confused by this and in verses 17-18 they discuss   with each other what in the world he means by a little while they   won't see him and then in a little while they will.        Jesus knows they are puzzled and so he says in verse 20,   "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament but the   world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will   turn into joy." What's he referring to? He's referring to his   death, when the disciples will have a deep and anguished sense of   loss, and his resurrection, when their sorrow will become joy   (John 20:20).        In verse 21 he compares what is about to happen to him and to   the disciples with a woman in childbirth. For a little while there   is sorrow as a very painful loss occurs -- the baby that has been   so close and so secure and so comfortable is cast out in a   painful, bloody birth. But again "in a little while" the pain is   past and the loss is not really a loss at all, but an amazing   gain. The child is not lost, but present in a way that can now go   on and on and on.        So it will be with Jesus. "In a little while" he will be lost   in a painful, bloody crucifixion. There will be weeping and   lamenting and fear in the disciples. But Jesus says, look at it   like a birth. The child must be lost from the warmth of the womb   to be gained as a person in the world. Yes I am dying. Yes it will   be painful for you. But "in a little while" you will see me again,   and your sorrow will become joy. It's like what he said in John   12:24, "Unless a grain of wheat falls in to the ground and dies it   remains alone, but if it dies it bears much fruit." You lose me in   one sense, but gain me in one far greater.        So when we come to verse 22 we know what Jesus has in mind,   namely, his death and resurrection. He says, "So you have sorrow   now." And he means that his death is just around the corner and   the loss and pain will be great for his friends. Then he says,   "But I will see you again." That is, I will rise from the dead.   And I will come to you. I will seek you out. (Note: After saying   three times in vv. 16,17,19 "you will see me," he says in verse   22, "I will see you.")        Then he says, "Your hearts will rejoice." That's just what   happened. It says in John 20:20, that on the first day of the   week, the day Jesus rose from the dead, he came to them and   "showed them his hands and his side." Then John says, "The   disciples were glad when they saw the Lord." So Jesus' prediction   in John 16:22 came true. "I will see you again and your hearts   will rejoice."        And then come the amazing words that we are focussing on this   morning, "And no one will take away your joy from you." This joy,   is irrevocable joy. It cannot be destroyed. It cannot be lost. It   is sure and firm and solid and certain even if everything around   our soul gives way. This joy will not.        Why not?        That's the key question: How can Jesus make such an   unparalleled guarantee -- unlike anything in this world? "No one   will take your joy from you."        Let's look at two answers from this gospel.        1. First, "No one will take your joy from you," because your   joy comes from being with Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus   means that Jesus will never die again; he will never be cut off   from you.        He says, "I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice."   This text doesn't offer any guarantees to people who don't enjoy   being with Jesus. If Jesus says to you this morning, "I will see   you again," and your heart does not rejoice in being with him,   then this text is not a promise for you, it's an invitation. It's   an invitation to love Jesus. Because if you don't enjoy Jesus,   your joy will be taken from you. Jesus is the only permanent   joy.        Notice the sequence of thought in verse 22: "I will see you   again, and your heart will rejoice." Why will they rejoice?   Because Jesus will be with them again. Then it says, "No one will   take your joy from you." What joy can never be taken away? Joy at   being with Jesus. That's the joy that's guaranteed for ever. No   other joy. If you don't have that, the joy you do have is very   fragile indeed. More fragile and uncertain than downtown   Minneapolis. And so this text is an invitation to people whose joy   is mainly in money or success or family or hobbies or sex or being   liked or games or sports or church. It's an invitation to see   Jesus as the only joy that lasts for ever. "I will see you again   and your heart will rejoice." Forever.        And why will he last for ever? Because he has been raised from   the dead and will never be cut off from us again. He defeated   death. Now he lives for ever and has the keys of death in his own   hands. So when he says, "No one will take your joy from you," he   means, I will be your joy, and I can never die again, and   therefore your joy will never die. As long as I exist in my   resurrection life, that's how long your joy in me will be. No one   can take it from you, because it is joy in me and I will live for   ever and ever.        That's the first answer to the question how Jesus can make such   an amazing guarantee. Our joy is in being with Jesus, and because   of the resurrection he will never be cut off from us again.        2. The other reason is this: "No one will take your joy from   you" because your joy comes from being with Jesus, and the   resurrection of Jesus means that you will never die; you will   never be cut off from him.        You see, two things have to be true if your joy is never to be   taken from you. One is that the source of your joy lasts forever   and the other is that you last forever. If either you or the   source of your joy is mortal, your joy will be taken from you.        And, O, how many people have settled for just that! Eat, drink   and be merry they say, for tomorrow we die, and that's that. Food   doesn't last for ever, and I don't last forever. So let's make the   most of it while we can. What a tragedy!        If you are tempted to think that way this morning please   consider as seriously as you possibly can that if your joy were in   being with Jesus, "No one would take your joy from you" -- not in   this life, nor in the life to come.        For two reasons: One because Jesus will never die again. And   the other because you will never die. Look at John 14:18,19. It is   a saying very much like the one we are looking at here. Jesus   says, "I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you. Yet a   little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see   me; because I live you will live also."        "Because I live you will live also." The resurrection of Jesus   means that not only will he live forever as the source of our joy,   but you will live forever if he is the source of your joy.        Jesus said to Martha at the tomb of Lazarus, "I am the   resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die,   yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall   never die" (John 11:25-26).        So the two great reasons why "No one will take your joy from   you," are that Jesus the source of joy will never die and those   who have Jesus as the source of their joy will never die.        Someone may say, "But Christians do die." Yes, in one sense we   do. But not in the most important sense, namely, the joy that a   believer has in being with Jesus is never broken. "No one will   take your joy from you." Not life or death, or angels or   principalities, or things present or things to come or powers or   height or depth or anything else in all creation will be able to   take our joy from us in Jesus Christ. Joy in being with Jesus is   an unbroken line from now to eternity. It will not be cut off by   his death or ours.        And so I commend Jesus to you this morning, whoever you are. If   he is not the joy of your heart, he wants to be. He says in John   6:35, "I am the bread of life, he who comes to me shall not hunger   and he who believes in me shall never thirst" -- NEVER! An   unbroken line of satisfaction in Jesus from the now to   eternity.        This is the word of the risen Jesus to us this morning -- to   all of us who will take him as our joy!: "You will see me . . .   and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from   you."        Shall we say it together one last time. Only this time let's   not say, "No one will take your joy from you," but, "No one will   take our joy from us." If you believe that, this morning, make it   you Resurrection Day confession of faith and say, NO ONE WILL TAKE   OUR JOY FROM US!        Amen.        Benediction:        The Lord is King       The Savior Reigns       And no one will take your joy from you.       Alleluya! Amen!
