         THAT YOUR PRAYERS MAY NOT BE   HINDERED         (1 Peter 3:7)         
          Youhusbands      likewise, live with our wives in an understanding way, as with      a weaker vessel, since she is a woman; and grant her honor as a      fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not      be hindered.          
        In Peter's first letter --   that we have been focusing on since last September -- Peter   mentions prayer three times. What is remarkable about these three   instances is that there is something common to each of them. Let   me read them to you and see if you can detect the common thread   running through each.         First, Peter has a word for   husbands about prayer and their relationship with their wives   (3:7):         You husbands likewise, live   with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker vessel,   since she is a woman; and grant her honor as a fellow heir of the   grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.         Second, in the very next   paragraph he speaks to all believers (in v. 8) about being   brotherly and kindhearted and humble and (in v. 9) not returning   evil for evil but instead giving a blessing. Then to support these   admonitions he quotes Psalm 34 in vv. 10-12:         For, "Let him who means to   love life and see good days refrain his tongue from evil and his   lips from speaking guile. And let him turn away from evil and do   good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord   are upon the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but   the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."         Third, in 1 Peter 4:7 he   says,         The end of all things is at   hand; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the   purpose of prayer (literally: for the sake of prayers).         Now what is the unusual   common thread running through those three references to prayer?   What struck me is that all three teach us not that praying helps   us live right, but that living right helps us pray. Now it's true   that praying is one of the ways God has appointed to help us live   the way we should (cf. Col. 1:9-10). But Peter's point in every   one of these texts is that it's true the other way around: God has   appointed a way for us to live which will help us pray. There are   ways live that hinder prayers and there is a way to live that   helps prayer.         Let's look at these   similarities again and you ask this time: what is Peter telling us   about how living helps praying.         The first one in 3:7 tells   us husbands that there is a way to live with our wives that can   clog our prayers, and a way to live with our wives that will help   our prayers.         You husbands likewise, live   with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker vessel,   since she is a woman; and grant her honor as a fellow heir of the   grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.         If you want your prayers to   be helped and not hindered you have to live with your wife in a   certain way. There has to be an effort to understand her so as to   know her needs. There has to be a special solicitousness of her   weaknesses and what she especially needs from you. There has to be   a recognition that she is a fellow heir of the grace of life and   an accompanying bestowal of honor rather than any belittling or   demeaning. When we husbands live like this (with understanding,   tender care, and honor), our prayers will not be hindered. If we   do not live like this our prayers will be hindered.         Here's the way one good   commentary put it:         So concerned is God that   Christian husbands live in an understanding and loving way with   their wives, that he "interrupts" his relationship with them when   they are not doing so. No Christian husband should presume to   think that any spiritual good will be accomplished by his life   without an effective ministry of prayer. And no husband may expect   an effective prayer life unless he lives with his wife "in an   understanding way, bestowing honor" on her. To take the time to   develop and maintain a good marriage is God's will; it is serving   God; it is a spiritual activity pleasing in his sight. (Wayne   Grudem, 1 Peter, p. 146.)         There is a way to live with   our wives that clogs our prayers and ruins our spiritual impact.   And there is a way to live with our wives that frees our prayers   and helps empower our spiritual impact.         Second, Peter goes on in   verses 8 and 9 to call all of us, not just husbands, to be   sympathetic, and brotherly and kindhearted and humble, and not to   return evil for evil but to bless those who are unkind to us. Then   he gives a reason for why we should live like this. It's a quote   from Psalm 34 and in verse 12 the reason comes to a climax with   the same kind of argument as in 3:7, namely prayers are hindered   if you don't live this way. God has a special openness to the   prayers of those whose pursue peace and whose lips are pure and   who don't use guile (deceit). Verse 12: "For the eyes of the Lord   are upon the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but   the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."         God listens to the prayers   of those who live like this: keep the tongue from evil, refrain   from guile, seek peace, do righteousness. So here again Peter is   telling us how to keep our prayers from being hindered. It's the   same thing Jesus was teaching in the Lord's prayer when he told us   to pray, "Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against   us" (Matt. 6:12). Not forgiving those who repent will clog our   prayers. That's Peter's point too. There is a way to live that   hinders our prayers and a way to live that helps our   payers.         Third, in 4:7 he says, that   there are special endeavors we can make so that our prayers will   be helped and not hindered:         The end of all things is at   hand; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the   sake of prayers.         Two things: first, be of   sound judgment for the sake of your prayers; second, be sober for   the sake of your prayers. In other words, there is a way to think   and live that will hinder your prayers and there is a way to think   and live that will help your prayers.         So there is a doctrine -- a   Biblical truth -- that we can now state with great confidence from   these texts:         Christians must endeavor to   live in a way that does not hinder their prayers.         It has three parts: 1) it   implies that prayers can be hindered. Our prayer life can be   clogged, blocked. 2) What blocks prayer is often our lives -- the   way we live, the way we relate to wives or husbands or kids or   parents or colleagues or neighbors. 3) Opening the way of prayer   to God involves a conscious endeavor. In each of these texts Peter   is telling us to resolve to do something so that our prayers will   not be hindered.         In other words a free, open,   real, satisfying life of prayer is not automatic. It doesn't just   happen to you while you are passive. If it did, these three texts   would be pointless. Your prayer life in 1994 depends in part --   under God and his enabling grace (1 Cor. 15:10 -- on how you   choose to live at home and at work and in your private life of   solitude.         So another way to state the   doctrine we've seen in these verses would be: do whatever you must   do so that your prayers are not hindered. Form the resolution   right now in your heart while I am preaching that you will not be   passive about your prayer life this year; that you will take some   active steps to make it good.         Let me ask a question that   might increase your incentive to do that. Why does it matter that   your prayer life not be hindered? There are a lot of tremendously   important answers to that question. Next week we'll talk about one   that relates your little life to the greatness of heaven and the   end of the world. But let me give an answer today that lies close   to my own experience.         You don't want your prayers   to be hindered because when your prayers are hindered it means you   are not connecting with God, and that God himself starts to seem   distant and unreal.         Now for an unbeliever who   has never known a peaceful, personal, walk with God, that would   not be so unusual. Unless the Holy Spirit is at work in their   lives, they have deadened themselves to it. But for a person who   has known God and loved him, and tasted the sweetness of peace and   fellowship, and a sense of being right with God, nothing is more   terrifying than the growing feeling that God does not seem to be   there anymore.         To wake up in the morning or   to go to bed at night and to lie there and stare at the ceiling   and feel, "It's not real. He's not listening."         To feel like all the bolts   in your mind are coming loose and it won't hold still long enough   to focus on anything, let alone God. There's just an uneasy   rattling and slipping of instability.         To try to formulate a prayer   and feel utterly phony because your mind is so full of worldly   stuff and earthly feelings and fleshly desires that a sweet,   peaceful, confident communion with God in prayer seems about as   possible as flying to the moon.         These are terrifying   experiences for a Christian who has known peace with God, and   unhindered communion with him. And so I am saying that Peter wants   to spare you that. I want to spare you that. I want to avoid it   myself at any price.         So Peter tells us: endeavor   to live in a way that does not hinder your prayers. (Note: it   almost goes without saying that this endeavor is not an effort to   earn wages from God but is an effort to follow our Good   Physician's loving prescription because we trust him.) Resolve   this morning that during prayer week, you will take his teaching   seriously and seek to do whatever you need to do to unclog your   prayers and set them free.         It may be that changes need   to be made at home. Nothing is more important than unclogging the   streams of prayer and power that are clogged at home.         It may be that changes need   to be made in the wider circle of relationships where there is   bitterness or guile.         Or it may be that there are   simple awakenings that need to happen concerning the pattern of   prayer in your life. When Peter says in 4:7, "Be of sound judgment   and sober spirit for the sake of prayers," he means that there are   disciplines of the mind and the spirit which can preserve   unhindered prayer in your life.         This I think, is what God   wants you to especially hear from this message this morning: make   Prayer Week 1994 a week of freshly awakened sound judgment   regarding what hinders prayer in your life and a week of sobriety   of spirit regarding prayer. Sound mind. Sober spirit.         Jesus does not kiss a drunk   wife. He may carry her off the street and back to bed. He may be   utterly patient with her, and set before her hot coffee and fresh   starts. But he will not kiss a drunk wife.         What do I mean? I mean that   when the bride of Christ, the church, is drunk with the world, she   may turn to him for a brief kiss of prayer, but her breath wreaks   so bad of worldliness that he turns his face a way.         "Be sober for the sake of   your prayers," Peter says. But whoever sobered up by coasting?   Nobody coasts into sobriety. Not physical sobriety, and not   spiritual sobriety. Sobriety happens when we begin to use sound   judgment about our lives. Sound judgment about how we spend our   time. Sound judgment about the spiritual climate or our homes.   Sound judgment about the worldliness of our leisure. Sound   judgment about the music we listen to, the movies we attend, the   TV we watch.         Nobody sobers up without   intentional steps to get the bottles of worldliness off the   shelves, out of the cabinet and out of the house. When that   happens, then the spiritual breath begins to clear up and the kiss   of prayer is not hindered.         There are so many ways we   can be helpful to each other at this point. There are so many   things God has been teaching some of you recently, several of you   have told me examples. I want us tonight to teach and exhort and   encourage and if necessary rebuke each other. I invite you to pray   this afternoon about what God might be wanting you to say to us   this evening. I also invite questions and struggles to be shared.   We need to hear about the real world of warfare that you are   waging.         I will share some of the   things that help me in the fight for unhindered prayer. But I   fully expect that what you say tonight will be what God uses most.   Pray. Come. Speak in weakness or in strength. Someone will be here   needing exactly what God prompts you to say.        Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
