  February 20, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       BECOMING A SPIRITUAL HOUSE AND HOLY PRIESTHOOD    (1 Peter 2:4-8)        And coming to Him as to a living stone,rejected by      men, but choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as      living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a      holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to      God through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture:      "Behold I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious corner stone,      and he who believes in Him shall not be disappointed." This      precious value, then, is for you who believe. But for those who      disbelieve, :The stone which the builders rejected, this became      the very corner stone," and, "A stone of stumbling an a rock of      offense"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the      word and to this doom they were alsoappointed.         As I sought the mind of the Lord about what we as a people   would need from God's word this morning it seemed to me that the   very next passage scheduled in 1 Peter is precisely what we need.   It is not the only thing we need. But we do need it. And we need   it badly. It is a word about how to offer spiritual sacrifices   acceptable to God. We will focus on verses 4-5.       How spiritual sacrifices become acceptable to God       Notice in these verses six steps in the way God gets spiritual   sacrifices acceptable to him.       1. First, in verse 4, there is Jesus Christ the living Stone.   Peter calls him a stone because of prophecies in the Old   Testament: "Behold I am laying in Zion a stone" (Isaiah 28:16).   "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the   corner" (Psalm 118:22). We'll come back to this.       2. Second, in verse 4 those who have tasted the kindness of the   Lord (recall verse 3 from three weeks ago) -- those who have   tasted that the Lord is kind and now long for him the way a baby   longs for milk -- they now (in verse 4) come to him, the : "And   coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected by men, but choice   (=chosen) and precious in the sight of God."       3. Third, the result of this coming to him is that we are   shaped into living stones for use in a spiritual building. Verse   5: "You also as living stones are being built." Contact with the   Living Stone makes us alive and fits us for our place in his   architectural plan.       4. Fourth, when we come to the living stone and are shaped into   living stones ourselves, we are built into a "spiritual house."   Christ is the builder here. He builds individual Christians into a   spiritual temple. It's spiritual because it houses the Holy   Spirit. "Do you not know that you are the temple of God and the   Spirit of God dwells in you?" (1 Cor. 3:16). That's a reference to   the local church, not to individuals in this context.       What we see so far is that God lays this stone, Jesus Christ,   in Zion, that is, in Jerusalem, and men reject it -- crucify him   -- but God has chosen this stone and regards him as infinitely   precious, and raises him from the dead and makes him an   ever-living stone, and gives him the place of highest honor at the   head of the corner. All of this to the end that Christ might   gather a people who would themselves be alive like him and would   make a temple, a church -- an eternal dwelling place for the   Spirit of God.       5. Fifth, the greatness of the reality forces the imagery to   break down. Not only are we living stones being built into a   spiritual house for God's habitation, we are also a "holy   priesthood." In other words, we are not merely the passive   building where God dwells; we are also the active participants in   worship. And not just participants, but a special kind of   participant, the priests. All of you. This is the great teaching   about the "priesthood of all believers."       We all -- lay people and vocational elders -- are the priests   of this new spiritual house, and our privilege now as priests is   to draw near to God with spiritual sacrifices. The priests brought   the sacrifices into the tabernacle in the Old Testament. But now   that tabernacle is replaced by the Christian church. The atoning   altar is replaced by Jesus Christ and his shed blood. And the   priests are replaced by you, those who believe in Christ.       6. Sixth, the goal of all this is that spiritual sacrifices   would be offered which are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.       Make sure Jesus gets his due right here. God's aim is that we   offer him spiritual sacrifices (we'll talk about what that is in a   minute). And we can only do that "through Jesus Christ." Jesus is   the Living Stone. Everything hangs on our coming to the Living   Stone. If we don't come to Jesus, the Living Stone, then we don't   have life and we are not built into a spiritual house, and we do   not become a holy priesthood, and we will not offer spiritual   sacrifices. It all hangs on Jesus and connecting with Jesus --   coming to Jesus. That's why Peter ends verse 5 with the words "to   offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus   Christ."       This should cause us to love Jesus with all our hearts. He is   the only way to God. He is the only way to be alive for ever. He   is the only way to be dwelling for God. He is the only way we can   do anything acceptable to God. This is why verse 7 says that he is   precious, costly to us who believe. Yes, infinitely precious.   There is no greater value in the universe than Jesus. He means   more to us than anything or anybody.       Just think of all the people around the world who know there is   a God. Nature declares his glory and their own consciences tell   them it must be so. But they don't know how to do anything fully   acceptable to this God -- because they don't know Jesus. They try   rituals and disciplines and sacrifices and vows and relics and   virtues -- but all in vain. Because God says (at the end of verse   5) the sacrifices that are acceptable to him are acceptable   "through Jesus Christ." Not through human effort or human merit or   human achievement. But "through Jesus Christ."       That's why Paul said in Romans 15:18, "I will not presume to   speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me."       The preciousness of Christ to our hearts is this: through him   we know God and come to God and experience the presence of God and   offer acceptable sacrifices to God. Without him all is distance   and darkness and wrath. Christ is precious, very precious.       What are these spiritual sacrifices?       Now let's walk backward through some of these six steps and   take another look at them.       What are these spiritual sacrifices that we offer to God   through Jesus Christ (v. 5b). If that's the goal of everything   else, it must be very important. What is it?       Bodies       In Romans 12:1 Paul says that we are to present our bodies as   living sacrifices holy and acceptable to God which is your   spiritual service of worship. That means I think that everything   you do with your body is to be done as an act of worship to God.   Whether you eat or drink or hammer nails or drive a car or make a   meal or program a computer or read a book or shoot a basketball or   mend a shirt -- whatever you do with your body do to the glory of   God (1 Cor. 10:31). Then it is your spiritual service of worship.       Praise and thanks       It might include singing or speaking words of praise as in   Hebrews 13:15, "Continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God,   that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to his name." So the   spiritual sacrifices are the praises and thanks of God's people   alone and in group worship.       Acts of love       Or it might include acts of love like giving and sharing. For   example, in Philippians 4:18 Paul receives gifts of support from   the Philippian church and says, "I received from Epaphroditus what   you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice,   well-pleasing to God." And in Hebrews 13:16 it says, "Do not   neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is   pleased."       What then are spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through   Jesus Christ? They are the deeds you do, the words you speak, the   songs you sing -- when you do them spiritually. That is, when you   do them in reliance on the power of the Spirit, according to the   will of the Spirit, and for a manifestation of the Spirit -- which   is a manifestation of Christ.       This is clearly a word to us about our worship here at   Bethlehem. Is it spiritual? Are the sacrifices we offer spiritual   sacrifices? Are we leaders in worship spiritual people? Do we sing   in the power of the Spirit, and according to the will of the   Spirit, and as a manifestation of the Spirit of Christ? Do our   instrumentalists play their instruments in the power of the   Spirit, according to the will of the Spirit and as a manifestation   of the Spirit of Christ? Do I preach in reliance on the power of   the Spirit, according to the will of the Spirit, and as a   manifestation of the Spirit of Christ?       Is our worship spiritual? If it is not, it is not acceptable to   God. If it is, he will accept it, not because its perfect -- it   never will be in this age -- much less because its refined or   well-crafted, but because it comes "through Jesus Christ."   Spiritual sacrifices are sacrifices from Christ and through Christ   and for Christ. They get their power from the Spirit of Christ,   they get their content from the Word of Christ, and they have   their goal in the glory of Christ. And they flow only from a heart   devoted to his power and his word and his glory. And that is the   only kind of worship God accepts.       Spiritual sacrifices offered by a holy priesthood       The second step in moving backward through the six steps is   that these spiritual sacrifices are offered by a holy priesthood.   That's not the pastoral staff, that's not the elders, that's not   the choir; its you the people. Look at verse 9: "You are a chosen   race, a royal priesthood." This means that you all have access to   God through Jesus Christ. You do not take your sacrifice to the   priest and watch while he takes it to the altar or to the tent of   meeting with God. You all are called by God to approach the altar   and the throne, and to make your own personal sacrifice in   personal life and in corporate worship.       And therefore you must be holy (1:15). You must be set apart   for God. Cleansed by the blood of Christ through faith, and   dedicated to relentless and ruthless opposition to sin in your   life. If your hand causes you to sin cut it off. If your eye   causes you to sin, gouge it out. You are a priest to God. You are   a part of worship team, called "the holy priesthood." Without this   God-wrought holiness we do not offer spiritual sacrifices   acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.       The holy priesthood is also a spiritual house       Third, this holy priesthood is also a "spiritual house." You   are all living stones built by God into a spiritual house, that is   a temple made for the presence of a holy God. Listen to the way   Paul said this in Ephesians 2:19-22        You are . . . of God's household, . . .Christ Jesus      Himself being the corner stone, in whom the whole building,      being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the      Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling      of God in the Spirit.         The main thing here is that we as a church are meant by Christ   to be a corporate dwelling of God in the Spirit. It's true that   each of us is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19). But   there is more of God to be known and enjoyed than any one can know   in isolation. We are being fitted together, Paul says, for a   temple and for a dwelling of God by his Spirit. There is a   presence and power and manifestation of the Spirit of God meant to   be known in this gathering of worship that we do not know at any   other time in isolation.       We are not just isolated living stones. We are, verse 5 says,   being built (by Christ -- "I will build my church") as a spiritual   house. The stones are meant to so fit together in this house   called Bethlehem that something whole, something more than a   collection of individuals comes into being -- a temple, a dwelling   of God by his Spirit.       And O how jealous I am to see that happen more than it ever   has.       And to that end let me just return to the strategy Peter   focuses on for this to happen. He says in verse 4, "And coming to   Him &#91;Christ&#93; as to a living stone, rejected by men, but   chosen and precious in the sight of God, you also, as living   stones, are being built." How are we being built into this   spiritual house? By coming to Christ.       Now be careful here. This is not a reference to conversion --   that initial coming to Christ, though that it awesomely important   and I pray some may come this morning for the first time. It is a   reference to daily, hour by hour drawing near to Christ as a   strong, living Person.       Notice, verse 4 flows out of verse 3 and refers back to it with   the word "him". Verse 4: "Coming to HIM" -- to whom? To the one   whose kindness you have tasted -- how good it is. This helps us   get a good handle on what "coming to Christ" means. Verse 3 is an   incentive in both directions. It motivates verse 2 and it   motivates verse 4.       If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord -- then (v. 2) long   for the word of Christ the way a baby longs for milk. If you have   tasted the kindness of the Lord -- then (v. 4) come to Christ.       Coming to Christ is what you do when you long for his word the   way a baby longs for milk, and, longing for it, come to it and   feed on it and find Christ in it. "They feast on the abundance of   Thy house and Thou givest them drink from the river of Thy   delights" (Ps. 36:8).       If we are going to be a spiritual temple for God's presence,   and if we are going to be a holy priesthood and if we are going to   offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, then we must day by   day, hour by hour come to Christ. We must taste his kindness by   feeding on his word -- his promises, his commands, his teachings,   his warnings -- until we are so filled with him that his word will   dwell among us richly as we teach and admonish one anther with   thankfulness in our hearts to God.
