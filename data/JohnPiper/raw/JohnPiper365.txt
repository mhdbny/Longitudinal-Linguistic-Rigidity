 November 22, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       You were bought with a Price;    glorify God with your bodies    (1 Corinthians 6:20)         For you have been bought with a price: therefore      glorify God in your body.                One of the things we all have in common this morning is that we   all have bodies. And I want to talk about what our bodies have to   do with God. But there is something else that we all have in   common and I want to start there.        We all have a sense of justice when we are wronged, or when   someone we care about is wronged. If someone intentionally,   maliciously, without any provocation, lies about you or steals   from you or pushes you harshly or strikes your child, there is   something in you that wants justice. And one of the most common   ways we express that feeling is with the words, "You will pay for   this!"        In other words, our sense of justice automatically demands a   payment from the person who wrongs us.        But Jesus taught his followers that we should love our enemy   and that we should often turn the other cheek and that we should   not return evil for evil, but bless those who persecute us. So   does that mean that Christianity denies this basic sense of   justice that all of us seem to have? Does Christianity teach that   wrongs don't have to be repaid? That justice is cheap and that   there's no price that has to be paid for injustice?        No, that's not what Jesus means. When Jesus tells us to return   good for evil he doesn't mean that no price is required for evil;   he means that God will pay it so that we don't have to. The Bible   says, "Do not avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,   for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the   Lord'" (Romans 12:19). God is a God of perfect justice. He sees   every wrong done. His memory is infallible. And he will repay with   perfect justice.        So when Jesus says, "Do good to those who hate you, bless those   who curse you" (Luke 6:27), he does not mean that justice won't be   done; he means God will do it. Trust him. Leave it to him. Show   that you believe there is a just God in heaven by the way you can   lay down your bitterness and vengeance.        This may satisfy our sense of justice for a while. It may even   give us a sense of relief that the people that have wronged us   will eventually be brought to justice. And all the outrageous   evils of the world (millions of murders through Stalinist purges   in the 1930's and '40's, six million Jews eliminated in Nazi   Germany, a million people executed by the Khmer Rouge, tens of   thousands forcibly starved by tribal lords in Somalia, villages   slaughtered by the Shining Path in Peru, and untold murders in our   own country, like Tim White's, that never go to trial)--all these   evils will be set right before the judgment seat of the   universe.        For a while, I say, it feels right, because we all have this   sense of justice. But then something dawns on us--all of us.   Because there is something else we have in common, namely, a   guilty conscience. Just when we are feeling right about justice   being done to those who wrong us, we awaken to the fact that we   ourselves have done wrong. And our conscience asks, "Do you   approve of justice in your own case? Do you say concerning your   own wrongdoing, 'Vengeance is God's and he will repay! I am guilty   of sin before a holy God, and I will be judged.'?"        There are a lot of ways that we squirm to try to get out of   this. We tell ourselves that we are not as bad as others. We say   that we have done more right things than wrong things. We say that   we have suffered much and so we have already paid our dues. We say   there were extenuating circumstances. Or we may just go into   denial and repress our own wrongdoing or drown it with various   addictions and compulsions.        But Jesus offers another way to make things right with a God of   justice--a way to be free from the condemnation of God and of our   own conscience. It's a way that lets the principle of justice   stand and at the same time rescues people who would be condemned   by it. Jesus said, "The Son of Man (Jesus, himself) came not to be   served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many." His   life as a ransom! His life as a payment. Jesus said that he came   into the world so that when our conscience says, "You are going to   pay for that!" we can say back, "No I'm not because Jesus has   already paid."        The greatest news in all the world is that the Son of God has   paid the price of my condemnation. The New Testament says, "God   has done what the law . . . could not do: sending his own Son in   the likeness of sinful flesh he condemned sin in the flesh"   (Romans 8:3). The gospel of Jesus Christ, that God offers to   everyone who will believe, is that the death of Jesus, his Son, is   the payment for our sin and our guilt and our condemnation.        God doesn't change any of the rules of justice. He wrote them.   And he plays by them. God's justice says, "You're going to pay for   this." That's where we get our sense of justice. Four hundred   million years of evolution plus chance does not produce a   transcendent sense of justice in the human soul. It's there   because you and I were created in the image of a God of justice.   His justice and your justice says, "Wrongdoers will pay."        But the love of God says, "If you will trust me, and return to   me, I will pay it for you--in fact I will pay it with it with the   price of my own Son." The gospel of Jesus Christ is that all who   believe in him are bought with a price. They will never come into   condemnation. The judgment day is past. It was 2000 years ago.   When Jesus died, the debt was paid. Justice has been done. We are   free. And God is not against us but for us, if we will accept his   gift and trust him.        Now I invite you to turn to 1 Corinthians 6:20 because I said   at the beginning that I wanted to talk about what our bodies have   to do with God. The reason I want to do this is because I want to   make sure that I don't mislead anybody this morning that   Christianity is just a set of ideas or just a way of thinking or   just a way of getting the soul to heaven, when in fact it is has   everything to do with your body as well as your soul. It has to do   with everything your body has to do with--food and sex and sleep   and talking and smiling and frowning and laughing and playing and   working.        When Christ paid the debt for us to go free, he paid for our   body as well as our soul. Verse 20: "For you were bought with a   price: therefore glorify God in your body." When God paid the   price of his Son to purchase his people from sin and guilt and   condemnation, it was the ransom for their bodies as well as their   souls.        If I had time I would go out in the members of this church and   ask different ones of you to come up here and testify about what   difference God has made in your body. I would ask a man with AIDS,   tell us about what it means to glorify God with your body. I would   ask a man who just found out he has serious life-threatening   cancer and say, tell us about what it means to glorify God with   your body. I would ask a young woman who has struggled with   bulimia and has just turned a significant corner of hope, how do   you see God getting glory in your body? And I would ask dozens of   women who have lost the little bodies of unborn children, do you   believe God can be glorified in those bodies? And I do not doubt   that in every case, what you would hear is that God has indeed   manifested his glory in ways that many cannot imagine.        When Christ paid the price for his people, he bought our   bodies. So let me try to show you from this passage of God's word   what this means. What would it mean for you if you were to accept   the gift of God's price and trust him with your life--your soul   and your body?        It would mean six things.         1. It means that the Lord is for the body and not   against it.         Look at the very end of verse 13, "Yet the body is not for   immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body." Don't   miss that last phrase. "The Lord is for the body."        It is easy for Christians to get the reputation that we are   against the body, and that God is against the body as though its   needs and appetites are evil, and the only thing it's good for is   to get sick with and, as soon as possible to get shed of. That is   not true. The Lord made the body. And the Lord is for the body. To   be against the body is to be against the Lord. If you trust him he   will not be against your body, but for it. If we deny the body   some craving in this life, it is because we are for it in the   next.         2. It would mean that your body becomes the dwelling   place of the Holy Spirit.         Verse 19: "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the   Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God?" When God   bought us he did not buy us as slaves but as dwellings. His aim   was not to make us work for him, but to make us full of him.   "Filled with all the fullness of God" as the apostle Paul says   (Eph. 3:19).         3. It means that your bodies would be raised from the   dead.         Verse 14: "Now God has not only raised the Lord (Jesus), but   will also raise us up through his power." When the Bible says that   God is for the body and that our bodies are the temple of the Holy   Spirit, it means God will never throw our bodies away. He will   never let death have the last word.        Just as he raised Jesus from the dead and gave him an   everlasting resurrection body, so he will raise our bodies from   the dead and make them new and whole--with no more pain, no more   deformity, no more disability, no more sexual disorientation, no   more chemical imbalances, no more insomnia, no more disease of any   kind. You will shine like the sun in the kingdom of your Father   (Matt. 13:43).         4. It means that you do not have to be mastered by   anything but God.         Verse 12: "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are   profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be   mastered by anything." Not mastered by anything. If you have been   bought with a price, you do not have to be the slave of anything.   You would be God's own adopted child. Nothing could be your   master. You would have the Spirit within, you would be united with   Christ, you would have the hope of resurrection, and the Lord   himself would be for your body--nothing could be your slave   master.         5. You would not use your body for   immorality.         Verse 13b says, "Yet the body is not for immorality, but for   the Lord." And verse 18 says, "Flee immorality."        And the reason for this chastity and purity would not be   primarily that you might get AIDS or that you might get pregnant   or that you might get caught. The reason would be that your   body--male and female--has been bought with the price of the Son   of God. That it belongs to him. And that you love him because he   gave himself for you, and he wills your purity (Titus 2:14). He   died for it.        Which leads to the final meaning of being bought with a   price.         6. Your bodies are for the glory of G od.        Verse 20 again: "For you have been bought with a price:   therefore glorify God with your body."        What that means very simply is use your body in ways that will   show that God is more satisfying, more precious, more to be   desired, more glorious than anything the body craves.        With all my heart I commend to you the infinitely valuable   Jesus Christ. He is the Father's full and sufficient price for   sinners. If you receive him, then from this day forward every time   your conscience dredges up the sin of the past and says, "You will   pay!" you will be able to say, "God has already paid. I have been   bought with a price. I will glorify God with my body."        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
