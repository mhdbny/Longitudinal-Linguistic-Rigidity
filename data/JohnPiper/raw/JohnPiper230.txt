 March 23, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor            THE DANGER OF FOLLOWING JESUS    Maundy Thursday Communion Meditation    on Matthew 10:24-25        A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his   master; it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and   the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the   house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his   household.           As I have prayed and meditated over the last several weeks on what   I should say tonight I have come to distill it into one   sentence.        Jesus had love to suffer for me,    that I might have faith to suffer with him.        I have been reading the sufferings of Jesus in the light of the   Salmon Rushdie affair. Rushdie published a novel entitled Satanic   Verses. In it he put the Muslim prophet Mohammed and the Muslim   god Allah in a bad light. He was accused of blasphemy and the   Ayatollah Kohmeni ordered him executed and offered bounty for his   death.        I have put myself in Rushdie's place and felt how utterly   vulnerable he is. I do not look on this as a distant and strange   thing. To me it is very close. I felt this so strongly two weeks   ago that I wrote to the former Bethlehem interns who are now   scattered around the country as pastors and teachers. Here is what   I said:        What will you do when your preaching is so clear and pointed in   its missionary implications concerning the blasphemy of Muslim   teachings about Jesus that your name appears on the hit list along   with Rushdie's?        There is a hair's breadth between me and the condemnation of   the Ayatollah. One slight turn of social and historical affairs   and the militancy of the Muslim defense of the honor of Mohammed   and Allah could make us the target of a thousand guns. Are you   ready? Read of the wild-eyed, irrational spit and fists in Matthew   26:67 and then read Matthew 10:24-25.        I want you to see the connection that I saw in these   verses.        Matthew 26:67 simply says this: "Then they spat in his face,   and struck him; and some slapped him."        Matthew 10:24-25 says, "A disciple is not above his teacher,   nor a servant above his master . . . If they have called the   master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign   those of his household."        Now Salmon Rushdie is no follower of Jesus as far as I can   tell. That's not the point. The point is that we Christians by   definition believe that Allah is not the true God as Muslims know   him and Mohammed is not a true prophet. Jesus really is the Son of   God and really did die on the cross and rose again and reigns at   God's right hand until he puts all his enemies under his feet,   including Mohammed and his followers. And saying that is enough to   get me killed -- and you.        The days will soon be gone, if they aren't already, when you   can assume that it is safe to follow Jesus -- to stand for his   majesty and his commandments. So I have been thinking much about   whether I am willing to pay the price. And if I say yes, where   will I get the courage and the freedom to suffer with Jesus?        It isn't just Islam with its endorsement of holy violence that   makes following Jesus dangerous today. Consistent Biblical   Christians, who don't absorb the spirit and trends of the age, are   increasingly at odds with major forces in our society. And what   makes the situation so volatile is that those forces are   increasingly strident and increasingly invested with legal   sanction.        For example, the Bible commands me and you to believe and and   stand for truths that are so offensive to radical feminism and to   homosexual rights groups and abortionists and the pornography   industry that we could easily be assaulted by hired assailants or   taken to court for conspiring to deny rights or shot by a fanatic   who believes he is serving God.        John 16:2 says, "Indeed the hour is coming when whoever kills   you will think he is offering service to God."        John 15:20 says, "A servant is not greater than his master. If   they persecuted me, they will persecute you."        The more clearly your life shows what God demands of people the   more dangerous will be your life. I think that is what Paul meant   when he said in 2 Timothy 3:12, "Indeed all who desire to live a   godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted." The greater your   desire to be godly the more you will offend people committed to   unbelief and sin and relativism.        Jesus said, "If you were of the world, the world would love its   own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of   the world, therefore the world hates you" (John 15:19). In other   words, if you let your light shine for Christ the children of the   light will come and glorify God because your good works, but the   children of darkness will not come and will call your goodness   many other names.        So I have been thinking a lot about the price of being a   Christian and a pastor with strong convictions in these days. And   the Lord has been good to me. He has made me to feel deep in my   soul...        That "the steadfast love of the Lord is better than life."        That losing life is saving it.        That I must suffer with him if I would be glorified with   him.        That everything in this world is as nothing compared to the   surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.        That pain and prison and death are not the great dangers after   all, but fear, and disobedience and conformity to the age are the   really great dangers.        And that even if we were being killed all day long and counted   as sheep for the slaughter, we would be more than conquerors   through him who loved us, because neither life nor death can   separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.        When I ask how I might press on in the face of possible and   actual persecution I come back to these things. And I sum them up   in the sentence I mentioned earlier:        Jesus had love to suffer for me,    that I might have faith to suffer with him.                When he suffered for me, he gave what I needed to suffer with   him. He gave me forgiveness for my sins (Matthew 26:28, "This is   my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the   forgiveness of sins.") So my guilt before God is gone. That means   God is on my side as long as I am trusting Jesus. And if God is on   my side, what can man do to me?        Jesus had love to suffer for me,    that I might have faith to suffer with him.        So my prayer tonight is that when you eat the bread and drink the   cup tonight you will be so full of faith in his surpassing worth   that no danger would ever hold you back from the fullest and most   radical obedience to all that the Lord has commanded us.        I concluded my letter to the young pastors with these   words,        I believe with all my heart that the secret of preaching well   (living well!) when the guns are pointed, will be whether we have   learned to love the taste of the BREAD OF HEAVEN far above the   taste of life in this world. "Thy steadfast love O Lord, is better   than life."        So savor, brothers and sisters, savor. I love you all. I am   glad that we will be together in the kingdom for ever!
