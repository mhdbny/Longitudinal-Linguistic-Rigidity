       "O Lord, Open a door for the Word!"    (Colossians 4:2-4)        
        Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with   thanksgiving; and pray for us also, that God may open to us a door   for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of   which I am in prison, that I may make it clear, as I ought to   speak.        I chose this text for one reason: because next Sunday our aim   is to worship at Northwestern College with a lot of people there   who don't ordinarily go to church and who need to receive Christ   as Lord and Savior of their lives. And if I understand this text   correctly the human key that might unlock the blessing of God's   power and grace in that service is steadfast, watchful, thankful   prayer. If we pray steadfastly this week, and with wakefulness,   and with expectant thankfulness, this text gives us strong hope   that God will open a door for the Word next week so that faith   will come to many people.        Let me begin with a story told by Wesley Duewel, whom I met out   at Colorado Springs a few weeks ago. The point of the story is   that God opens doors for the gospel in response to earnest   prayer.        The story is about Duncan Campbell, a minister of the United   Free Church of Scotland. He was a personal friend of Wesley Duewel   and told him many stories of God's amazing guidance during the   late 1950's and '60's in the Hebrides (the islands just west of   Scotland) where Campbell was serving.        On the Monday after Easter in 1952, Duncan was seated on the   platform after speaking to the Faith Mission Convention in Bangor,   Northern Ireland, when he sensed the inner voice say to him,   "Berneray!" (That is a small island in the Hebrides.) Duncan bowed   his head and prayed silently. Again came the name "Berneray." He   prayed on, and the name came a third time.        So Campbell turned to the chairman and whispered, "Brother, you   will need to excuse me. The Holy Spirit has just told me that I am   to go to Berneray." The chairman objected mildly, "You are the   speaker tomorrow." But nothing could stop him. He knew the Spirit   had spoken.        He reminded Wesley Duewel, who was telling this story, "I had   never been to Berneray, had never known anyone from there, and had   never received a letter from anyone there."        He went to the hotel and packed his two suitcases and contacted   the airport. There were no connections with Berneray because it   was too small and out of the way. So he caught the first flight to   the nearest island.        When he got there he went down to the coast and asked how to   get to Berneray. The answer from a fisherman was that there is no   usual commercial way, but that he would take him for such and such   an amount. It was almost the exact amount Campbell had in his   pocket.        When they got to Berneray the fisherman returned and left   Campbell alone on the shore. He climbed the bluff and found   himself on the edge of a plowed field and a farmer not far away.   He said, "Please go to the nearest pastor and tell him Duncan   Campbell has arrived." The farmer responded, "We don't have a   minister for the church now." "Do you have elders?" Campbell   asked. "Yes." "All right, go to the nearest elder and tell him,   Duncan Campbell has arrived."        The farmer looked at him quizzically, then started off across   the field as Campbell rested on his suitcases. After a while the   farmer returned and said, "The elder was expecting you. He has a   place ready for you. He has announced the meetings begin at nine   o'clock tonight."        While Campbell had been ministering in the convention at Bangor   three days earlier, this elder had spent the day praying in his   barn for God to send revival to the island. God gave him the   promise in Hosea 14:5: "I will be as the dew unto Israel." He   claimed it in faith. His wife in the house heard him praying in   the barn, "Lord, I don't know where he is, but You know, and with   You all things are possible. You send him to the island." He knew   in his heart that God was going to send Duncan Campbell, who had   been used in mighty revival in other parts of Scotland, to   Berneray. He was so sure that he would be there in three days that   he made all the arrangements to use the local church and had   announced the services.        Wesley Duewel goes on to say that great revival came to the   island of Berneray and a great door for the Word was opened that   no man could shut because God opened it. He draws out this lesson:   "When God has people who prevail in prayer, and people who know   how to recognize the voice of the Spirit and obey without   question, there is no limit to what God can do." (Story taken in   part verbatim from Let God Guide You Daily by Wesley Duewel,   Zondervan, 1988, pp. 117-119.)        Now let me ask you this morning: Is there any among you who   will pray this week for next Sunday's service like the elder of   Berneray? Who will pray, for me and for the people who may come,   like you have never prayed before &#151; that God would open a   door for the Word and awaken new life for many?        To encourage you, let's look at today's text in Colossians   4:2-4. Paul is urging the Colossians to pray just like I am urging   you today to pray. Let's talk first about the goals of this prayer   and second about the method of this prayer. What does Paul want   them to pray FOR, and what does he want them to pray LIKE?        I see two things he wants them to pray for, namely, for an open   door and for a powerful word. Or to put it another way: Paul wants   God to work in the unbelievers and he wants God to work in   him.        In verse 3 he says, "Pray for us also that God may open to us a   door for the Word." What does he mean by this? Three other times   Paul used this same image.        1. At the end of the first missionary journey with Barnabas   Paul reports to the church in Antioch (in Acts 14:27) about what   God had done. Luke puts it like this: "They declared all that God   had done with them, and how He had opened a door of faith to the   Gentiles." God opened a door and the result was faith.        2. In 1 Corinthians 16:8-9 Paul explains his itinerary like   this: "I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for   effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."   Here the open door is a set of circumstances or a climate of   receptivity that is making Paul's work unusually fruitful.        3. In 2 Corinthians 2:12 Paul says, "When I came to Troas to   preach the gospel of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord;   but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus   there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia." Again   the open door seems to be a remarkable set of circumstances that   would have been very effective for the gospel.        So when Paul pleads with the Colossians in our text, "Pray for   us also, that God may open to us a door for the Word," I take him   to mean when Christians pray God changes circumstances and   attitudes and receptivity for the Word so that instead of hitting   a brick wall, the Word finds an open door and becomes unusually   effective.        That is the first thing we should pray for next Sunday: that   God would work in all the circumstances surrounding this special   service, including the hearts of those who come to open a wide and   effective door for the Word of God. Pray the locks off of peoples   hearts. Pray open the doors of willingness to come and pray open   the doors of faith.        Let this sink into your mind and heart today: the key to   opening the door of God's blessing on next Sunday morning's   service will be prayer.        That's the first goal the text mentions for prayer &#151; the   first thing we should pray FOR. The second thing to pray for is   the clarity and boldness of the preacher. Verse 3-4, "Pray for us   also, that God may open to us a door for the Word, to declare the   mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison, that I may   make it clear, as I ought to speak."        In other words not only is there a need for God to open doors,   there has to be something clear and powerful to send through the   door &#151; namely, the Word, the mystery of Christ, the gospel.   This is a prayer for the preacher, the choir, and any others who   take the Word of God on their lips.        O how I need your prayers! If Paul could imagine himself   speaking the gospel in a way that was not clear and bold and   powerful, how much more can I imagine that for myself. Think of   it: the greatest preacher and missionary who ever lived (besides   the Lord Jesus) said that the effectiveness of his preaching   depended on the prayers of the church. If that is true for Paul,   it is true a hundred times over for me. What happens next Sunday   morning when I preach (as every Sunday morning) depends in great   measure on how you pray for me.        Those are the two goals Paul has &#151; 1) that a door be   opened in the lives of unbelievers and 2) that a clear and   powerful gospel message go through that door. Now we turn briefly   to the HOW of these prayers. That's what we are to pray FOR. Now,   what are we to pray LIKE?        Paul mentions three things. All three are mentioned in verse 2.   "Continue steadfastly in prayer." (That's the first way to pray.)   "Be watchful in it." (That's the second way to pray.) "With   thanksgiving." (That's the third way to pray.) Pray with   steadfastness, with watchfulness, and with thanksgiving.        "Steadfastness" means with constancy and devotedness. It's the   opposite of hit and miss. It implies earnestness and serious   pursuit of God, not just casual contact. It implies pressing on   and not giving up.        "Watchful" means being vigilant like a sentry on duty outside   the camp at night knowing that if you go to sleep in this job the   enemy can overthrow your mission. This is the note of prayer that   is so often missing when the church has settled into the world and   is just using prayer as a domestic intercom instead of a wartime   walkie-talkie. So Paul urges the church to remember how   tremendously serious the battle is. Heaven and hell hang in the   balance next week. So be watchful, awake, vigilant. Pray the way   you would if you knew that twelve unbelievers next Sunday morning   would hear the gospel for the last time.        Finally, Paul says, "Pray with thanksgiving." Next Sunday's   message will be given in the context of a Festival of   Thanksgiving. So this command is especially fitting for us. What   does Paul have in mind?        At least two things: 1)it's impossible, isn't it, to pray for   God to open a door of faith for others without remembering that He   did this very thing for you? When we pray for the salvation of   others, isn't the fervency of our prayer a mirror of how thankful   we are for our own salvation? If we don't feel thankful for our   own salvation &#151; for the time when God opened the door of our   heart &#151; then how can we pray with steadfastness and vigilance   for the salvation of others. O be thankful for your own salvation,   and you will pray with new zeal for others.        2)The other thing I think Paul means is that we should be   thankful for what God is going to do. Not just what he has done   for us, but for what he will do in answer to prayer. In other   words, pray with thanksgiving means pray with expectant faith. Be   thanking him in advance for what he is going to do.        So would you join me this week in steadfast, vigilant, thankful   prayer that a door would be opened for the word among many   precious unbelievers, and that I would speak the gospel with   clarity and power.        I am going to set aside three special times when I will be   praying here at the church and would welcome your company. First,   our usual Friday morning prayer time at 6:30 AM will be in the   overflow room this week. Second, I will be praying same place from   seven to eight Saturday morning. Third, we will gather for prayer   from 9 to 9:30 at Maranatha Hall (we will tell you the room when   you get there).        Paul Yonggi Cho, the pastor of one great Korean church   explained the difference between what God is doing there and what   he is doing here like this: "Americans stay after church and eat.   We stay after church and pray."        Lord give us more women like Mary Slessor, who said,        My life is one long, daily, hourly record of answered prayer   for physical health, for mental overstrain, for guidance given   marvelously, for errors and dangers averted, for enmity to the   Gospel subdued, for food provided at the exact hour needed, for   everything that goes to make up life and my poor service. I can   testify with a full and often wonder-stricken awe that I believe   God answers prayer. I know God answers prayer! (The Kneeling   Christian, author unknown, Zondervan, 1986, p. 94)        And Lord give us more men like Robert Murray McCheyene. He was   a pastor in Dundee, Scotland. He knew Hebrew well enough to speak   it with European Jews, he had an appetite for Greek classics. He   kept his diary in Latin. He could have left his church several   times for a bigger, more notable pulpit. But he didn't .Why?   Because no church could offer him more time for prayer than   Dundee.        Brothers and Sisters, Pray for a door to be opened to the word   next Sunday morning!        Copyright 1989, 1998 John Piper      Piper's   Notes
