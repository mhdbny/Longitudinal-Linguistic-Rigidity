 June 14, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       BEHOLD THE KINDNESS AND THE SEVERITY OF GOD    "The Echo and Insufficiency of Hell" Part 1    (Romans 11:17-22)         If some of the branches were broken off, and you,      being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became      partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, do not      be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant,      remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root      supports you.               You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I      might be grafted in." Quite right, they were broken off for      their unbelief, and you stand only by your faith. Do not be      conceited, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural      branches, neither will He spare you.                 Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those      who fell, severity, but to you, God's kindness, if you continue      in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.                 I am going to talk today and next week about hell as an echo of   God's worth and as insufficient to produce true repentance. So I   have called the two messages "The Echo and the Insufficiency of   Hell." I have taken Romans 11:22 as the text because it is in   obedience to this command that I am preaching these two messages.   It says, "Behold then the kindness and the severity of God." We   are commanded to behold--to look at--not only the kindness of God,   which we love to do, and ought to love to do! We are also   commanded to behold--to look at--the severity of God, which we do   not like to do as much.        Not to look at the severity of God is disobedient and dangerous   and unloving. It's like a parent teaching a child how a red hot   eye on the oven is good--it makes water boil to cook the spaghetti   noodles; it turns clammy eggs into a tasty white and yellow   breakfast; it pops popcorn--the oven is good; but then never   telling a little child that it is also very dangerous and can hurt   badly if misused is in itself dangerous and unloving.. So the   command to behold the severity of God is a very loving command.   And those who discourage us from seeing and believing this   severity--in spite of all their sensitive language--are not doing   us a favor.        In fact one of my motivations for choosing this subject is that   I want to warn you that more and more well-known and respected   Christian leaders are rejecting the historic Biblical   understanding of hell. What I mean by "historic Biblical   understanding of hell" is simply what is written in our own church   affirmation of faith (which is the same as the BGC affirmation of   faith), namely, "We believe in . . . the final judgment, the   eternal felicity of the righteous, and the endless suffering of   the wicked."        The historic Biblical view of hell is that it is "endless   suffering." Both words are Biblical and important: "endless"--hell   is forever and never has an end--and "suffering"--in this endless   condition people are in conscious torment.        The abandonment of this Biblical truth is following the pattern   of how other unpopular Biblical teachings are being abandoned: the   impulse of abandonment is not coming from the Bible, but from the   culture and from the subjective emotional impulses of   individuals.        For example, Clark Pinnock, wrote in 1990,        I was led to question the traditional belief in      everlasting conscious torment because of moral revulsion and      broader theological considerations, not first of all on      scriptural grounds. It just does not make any sense to say that      a God of love will torture people forever for sins done in the      context of a finite life . . . It's time for evangelicals to      come out and say that the biblical and morally appropriate      doctrine of hell is annihilation, not everlasting      torment. 1         This is the classical process for how a person moves from being   orthodox to unorthodox. Personal emotions and desires combine with   speculative reasonings about general ideas, and they take   precedence over specific Biblical texts and teachings. You can see   the process at work leading people to abandon other Biblical   teachings that from time to time don't fit the spirit of the   age--and seem unacceptable to enlightened modern people.        Four years ago John Stott wrote,        Emotionally, I find the concept &#91;of eternal      conscious torment&#93; intolerable and do not understand how      people can live with it without either cauterizing their      feelings or cracking under the strain . . . Scripture points in      the direction of annihilation. 2         Both Pinnock and Stott (and others today) argue that no one   goes to a hell of "endless suffering." Instead, if people do not   believe in Christ they are annihilated. That means they cease to   exist in any sense at all. They have no consciousness and   experience nothing. They are no more.        So in response to these recent challenges I spent a long time   during my writing leave wrestling again with this whole   issue--because it really makes a tremendous difference for   missions. The difference between suffering in hell for ever if you   don't trust Christ and simply ceasing to exist is an infinite   difference. Do you see that? This is no small adjustment in   Biblical teaching. It is massive. The difference between not   existing and existing in torment for ever is an infinite   difference.        Imagine God meeting Adolf Hitler at the judgment day and   saying: "For all your arrogance and unbelief and hatred and for   all the torture and misery that you brought on millions of people   my judgment of you is that from now on you will cease to exist.   You will feel nothing." And if you think that would be a terrible   thing for Adolf Hitler (or anyone else) ask yourself if you were   miserable during any of the thousands of years that you did not   exist before you were born. The pain you experienced for not being   born would be the pain Hitler experiences if he ceased to exist,   none at all.        But the main problem with the view that unbelievers simply go   out of existence is that the Bible teaches that those who do not   trust in Christ will be punished with eternal suffering. In other   words, annihilation leads the church away from Biblical truth. And   that always hurts people and dishonors God.        When the Bible says, "Behold the severity of God," we should do   that. And the severity of God includes the truth about hell as   endless suffering. In the chapter I wrote about this issue in the   new book on missions, I dealt with sixteen different passages of   Scripture. 3  It is not an isolated doctrine.        It is a profound and dreadful reality. To speak of it lightly,   or not to speak of it at all, or to speak of it in a way that   changes suffering into feeling nothing, simply proves that we do   not grasp its horror. I know of no one who has overstated the   terrors of hell. We can scarcely surpass the horrid images Jesus   used. "Weeping and gnashing of teeth," 4  "their worm   shall not die" (Mark 9:48); "unquenchable fire" (Matthew 3:12;   Mark 9:43); "eternal fire" (Matthew 25:41); "the hell of fire"   (Matthew 18:9); "eternal punishment" (Matthew 25:46); "anguish in   the flame" (Luke 16:24). The point of all these is that we are   meant to shudder. We are meant to tremble and feel dread. We are   meant to recoil from the reality. Not by denying it but by fleeing   from it into the arms of Jesus, who died to save us from it.        Revelation 14:11 is probably the most graphic New Testament   statement of the eternal suffering of the unrepentant. "The smoke   of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest   day or night." Torment for ever and ever. The endless suffering of   unrepentant sinners is a reality taught in Scripture and therefore   good for us to know about.        I want to close with a very solemn warning. I'll simply use the   words of Jesus: "If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut   it off and throw it away; it is better that you enter life maimed   or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal   fire" (Matthew 18:8).        I urge you to follow a process of thought about the Bible that   is the reverse of the one common today. Instead of coming to the   Bible and saying, "I feel that endless suffering cannot be just,   and so the Bible cannot be teaching it," rather say, "Since the   Bible teaches it, it must be just and therefore, O how infinitely   dreadful sin must be! How infinitely blameworthy it must be to   treat the glory of God with contempt! How infinite must be the   insult to God when we do not trust his promises! What infinite   beauty and glory and purity and holiness God must have, that   endless suffering is a just and fitting punishment for disobeying   his word! Annihilationism reduces sin from high treason to a   misdemeanor. Hell is meant to fill us with awe at the glory we   have scorned.        And it is to fill us with wonder that the death of one man--the   God-man, Jesus Christ--could bear the infinite penalty as a   substitute for everyone who repents and trusts in him. Hell is an   echo of the glory of God. It reveals the greatness of the glory   that has been rejected and the greatness of Jesus' suffering   because he bore that hell for all who believe.                              1 Clark Pinnock and Delwin Brown, Theological   Crossfire: An Evangelical/Liberal Dialogue, (Grand Rapids:   Zondervan Publishing House, 1990), pp. 226-7.         2 David Edwards, Evangelical essentials, with a   Response from John Stott, (Downers Grove: Inter Varsity Press,   1988), pp. 314-320.         3 Daniel 12:2; Matthew 3:12 (Luke 3:17); Mark   9:43-48; Matthew 18:8; Matthew 10:28 (Luke 12:4-5); Matthew   25:41,46; Matthew 26:24; Mark 3:29 and Matthew 12:32; Luke 16:26;   Romans 2:6-8; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Hebrews 6:1-2; Jude 12-13;   Revelation 14:11; Revelation 19:3; Revelation 20:10.         4 Matthew 8:12;13:42; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30.
