        FROM WONDER TO WITNESS    (Isaiah 43:10-13)        "You are my witnesses," says the Lord, "and my servant whom I   have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that   I am He. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after   me. I, I am the Lord, and beside me there is no savior. I declared   and saved and proclaimed, when there was no strange god among you;   and you are my witnesses," says the Lord. "I am God, and also   henceforth I am He; there is none who can deliver from my hand; I   work and who can hinder it?"        The book of Isaiah is the most sustained self-exaltation of God   in all the Bible. Chapters 43 and 44 are breathtaking in their   boast of the absoluteness of God. I, I am He, and there is no   other god, no other Savior, no other rock! I, I am the Lord the   Holy One of Israel! The book rings again and again with God's   boast in His own greatness.        What can we say to this but that God is utterly thrilled to be   God. There is a kind of volcanic exuberance in God over the fact   that He is God. He virtually erupts with the exaltation of His own   glory. God is thrilled to be God. Isaiah is ravished by the truth   that God is God. And the question this morning is ARE YOU? Is   there any eruption of wonder and awe and amazement in you that God   simply IS? That He is God?        This text is meant to nurture that experience and to turn it   into world-wide witness. Let me take those two points as my   outline: first the text means to nurture our sense of awe and   amazement that God is God; second the text means to turn that   wonder into witness. How does it nurture our wonder and amazement   at the sheer "godness" of God? It does so by telling us what it   means to be God.        The last two lines of verse 13 are really an exposition of what   it means to be God. God cries out, "I am God! Even from eternity I   am He!" (Here is what I mean:) "there is none who can deliver out   of my hand; I act and who can reverse it?" God lifts up the fact   that He is God: "I am God!" And then He fills it with its most   basic meaning: "I act, and no one can reverse it!" When I will do   a thing nothing can stop me.        When He says, "I am God!" He declares His deity. When He says,   "I act and none can reverse it!" He declares His glorious   sovereignty. To be God is to be sovereign; God nurtures our wonder   at His deity by telling us that it means sovereignty.   Indispensible to the holy praise of God is a kind of stunned sight   of His absolute sovereignty: "I act and no one can reverse it." He   means for our jaws to drop. I saw this again in Isaiah 45:5-7   where God predicts the coming of Cyrus centuries later. He   says,        I am the Lord, and there is no other; besides Me there      is no God. I will gird you, Cyrus, though you have not known      Me; that men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun      that there is no one besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no      other, the One forming light and creating darkness, causing      well-being and creating calamity; I am the Lord who does all      these.        God is at pains to declare that He is God and He alone. And to   drive that home He speaks of His sovereignty. He is willing to go   so far as to claim final responsibility for all the calamities of   the world. "I am the One who forms light and creates darkness, who   causes prosperity and creates calamity; I am the Lord who does ALL   these things." Why does God take final responsibility for all the   disasters of the world? Because He wants to fill us with trembling   awe that He is God. And that means He is sovereign. He acts and   none can reverse it!        And then I saw it again in Isaiah 46:9-10,        Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there   is no other; I am God and there is no one like Me, declaring the   end from the beginning and from ancient times things which have   not been done, saying, "My counsel will stand and I will   accomplish all my purpose."        And so here they come together again. "I am God!" And: "I will   accomplish all my purpose!" Deity. And: Sovereignty. I act and   none can hinder! God nurtures our wonder at His deity by directing   our attention to His sovereignty. Why? Because without sovereignty   there is no true God. The God of Isaiah is passionate to define   Himself in terms of sovereignty: "I act and none can reverse it."   "My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose." "I   make well and create woe, I am the Lord who does all these   things."        So the first point of our text is that God is God, which means   that God is soverign - He works and none can hinder. He is   thrilled with His own deity and sovereignty and so should we   be.        But now we must ask, does God nurture this wonder in us as a   merely private experience? Have we reached the apex of our joy and   the climax of our divine call where we have an overwhelming,   private experience of God's glory and power? NO! It is neither the   apex of our joy nor the climax of our call because God ignites the   fire of our worship to make us shine in the world. This is the   second point of our text, God means to make a witness out of our   wonder. He nurtures our wonder by showing us that He is a   sovereign God; and He makes our wonder into a witness for all the   world.        Verse 10 is crucial here, "You are my witnesses, says the Lord,   and my servant whom I have chosen that you may know and believe me   and understand that I am He." Notice three things from this   verse:        First, if you know God and believe God and understand that He   is God, it is because He chose you to know and chose you to   believe and chose you to understand that He is God. In other   words, this text teaches not only that we should stand in awe of   the sovereignty of God, but also that we stand in awe by the   sovereignty of God. God chose us to know, God chose us to believe,   God chose us to understand that He is God.        But that's only half the sentence. Why does God light the fire   of our knowing Him and believing Him and our sense of awe that He   is God? Answer: He lights this fire to make us shine. That's the   second thing to notice in verse 10: He means to turn our wonder   into witness. "'You are my witnesses," says the Lord, "and my   servant whom I have chosen'..." Chosen not only to know; chosen   not only to believe; chosen not only to grasp the glory that God   is God; but chosen as servant-witnesses: "You are my witnesses and   my servant whom I have chosen." No one lights a lamp and puts it   under a bushel. And God doesn't stun people with His deity and   sovereignty for merely private pleasures, God ignites our wonder   to make us a witness. That's the second thing to see in verse   10.        And the third thing to see is that the content of our witness   is God. It is the unmistakable emphasis of this text: God lights   the flame of worship so we will bear witness to God's exuberance   for God. We can be more specific. God lights the fire of wonder so   that we witness to God's sheer existence: (v. 13) "I am God and   also henceforth I am he." We witness to God's sovereignty:   (v.&yuml;13) "I work and who can hinder it?" We witness to the   truth that God alone is God: (v. 10) "Before me no God was formed   nor shall there be any after me." We witness to the truth that God   is eternal: (v. 13) "I am God, henceforth I am He. We witness to   the truth that God has spoken: (v. 12) "I declared and   proclaimed." We witness to the truth that this great uncomparable   God saves: (v. 11) "I, I am the Lord and beside me there is no   Savior; I declared and saved.        Two points: 1)&yuml;this text comes to nurture the wonder that   God is God: God magnifies His deity by directing us to His   sovereignty. 2)&yuml;the text means to turn that wonder into   witness. The flame of worship is a witness to God's exuberance for   God.        Now what does this mean for the BGC? Pastors, we must labor to   know God. And we must help our people know God. Do we know God? Do   we understand that He is God? The link in verse 10 between   understanding that God is God and being His witnesses is   unmistakable. Do our people understand that God is God - that He   works and none can hinder it? Is not this text telling us that our   root need in witness is to know God in such a way that God's   exuberance for being God rubs off on us? And then on the   world.        I think our prayer should be        O God, grant us to know you in such a way that the fire of our   wonder becomes an unquenchable flame of witness to the world.        Then we will say with powerful conviction:        Turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth!        For I am God, and there is no other.        By myself I have sworn        From my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall   not return: To me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall   swear.
