  April 6, 1986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning John Piper, Pastor Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   WHAT IS HOPE?  (Hebrews 6:1-12)   Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity,  not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith  toward God, with instructions about ablutions, the laying on of hands, the  resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And this we will do if God  permits. For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have  once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become  partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of  God and the powers of the age to come, if they then commit apostasy, since  they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt.  For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth  vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing  from God. But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to  being cursed; its end is to be burned.    Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feeel sure of better  things that belong to salvation. For God is not so unjust as to overlook  your work and the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints,  as you still do. And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness  in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you may not  be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit  the promises.  When I came to Bethlehem back in the middle of 1980 the signs were repaintedto include the name of the new pastor. Rollin asked me what I would liketo see painted on the back side of the north sign that faces the parkinglot. I said I would like to see the words from Psalm 42:5, "HOPE IN GOD!" That's the message I want all of us to have in mind every week as we leaveBethlehem and enter another week of work. The whole verse says,         Why are you cast down, O my soul,       and why are you disquieted within me?       Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,       my help and my God.     Richard Sibbes, one of the great old Puritan preachers of Cambridge who diedin 1635, wrote a whole book (175 pages) on Psalm 42:5. He was called "thesweet dropper" because of how much confidence and joy his sermons caused.He called his book The Soul's Conflict with Itself, because in Psalm 42:5,that is exactly what you have, the soul arguing with itself, preaching toitself. "Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted withinme? Hope in God!" Hoping in God does not come naturally for sinners like us. We must preachit to ourselves, and preach diligently and forcefully, or we will give wayto a downcast and disquieted spirit. This is evidently not well known among all the saints -- this preaching toyourself -- because in Cameroon I recommended it to several as a way of fightingoff discouragement, and it seemed quite a new thought to them. In fact threemonths after Noel and I returned I received a letter from one of the youngwomen who struggled most it seemed. She said, While I was on holiday at the end of May I had time to write myself foursermons on different topics, and it's been quite helpful to refer back tothem from time to time, though sometimes when I'm depressed reasoning doesn'tseem to get me very far and it's easier just to try to hold on to certainverses or truths. Indeed! The best sermon you preach yourself this week may be only three wordslong: HOPE IN GOD! I love the way the psalmists wrestle and fight and struggle and to maintaintheir hope in God. This is normal Christian experience while we are stilljust saved sinners. And we better own up to it, or else we may grow sluggishand negligent in our fight for hope. And that is very dangerous, as our textplainly teaches. A young woman from California asked me for an interview last week becauseshe was doing a psychology project on "forgiveness," and she needed to recordsome pastoral interviews. One of the questions she asked was something likethis: "What are some of your feelings when you forgive someone?" One of myfirst thoughts was that I have to have the feeling of hope in order to forgiveinstead of retaliate. In my life -- and I think is the intended Biblical pattern -- hope is likea reservoir of emotional strength. If I am put down, I look to the emotional reservoir of hope for the strengthto return good for evil. Without hope I have no power to absorb the wrongand walk in love, and I sink into self-pity or self-justification. If I experience a setback in my planning -- I get sick, or things don't gothe way I'd hoped in the board meeting, for example -- I look to the emotionalreservoir of hope for the strength to keep going and not give up. If I face a temptation to be dishonest, to steal, to lie or to lust, I lookto the emotional reservoir of hope for the strength to hold fast to the wayof righteousness, and deny myself some breif unsatisfying pleasure. That is the way it works for me. That is the way I fight for holiness inthe Christian life. And I believe this is the Biblical way to make our callingand election sure. My prayer is that as we focus our attention on our Christian hope over thenext 16 weeks God will fill your reservoir to overflowing, and that deepdown in the Hoover Dam of your soul the great hydro-electric generators ofjoy and love and boldness and endurance will churn with new power for theglory of God. We begin today with the most basic question of all: What is hope? Specificallywe want to know not just Webster's definition, but the Biblical definition.We have to know what we are talking about before we can can get very farin our grasp of the great truths about Biblical hope. We use the word "hope" in at least three different ways. 1. Hope is the desire for something good in the future. The children mightsay, "I hope daddy gets home early tonight so we can play kickball aftersupper before his meeting." In other words they desire for him to get homeearly so that they can experience this good thing, namely, playing togetherafter supper. 2. Hope is the good thing in the future that we are desiring. We say, "Ourhope is that Jim will arrive safely." In other words, Jim's safe arrivalis the object of our hope. 3. Hope is the reason why our hope might indeed come to pass. We say, "Agood tailwind is our only hope of arriving on time." In other words, thetailwind is the reason we may in fact achieve the future good that we desire.It's our only hope. So hope is used in three senses: 1) a desire for something good in the future,2) the thing in the future that we desire, and 3) the basis reason for thinkingthat our desire may indeed be fulfilled. All three of these uses are found in the Bible. But the most important featureof Biblical hope is not present in any of these ordinary uses of the wordhope. In fact the distinctive meaning of hope in Scripture is almost theopposite of our ordinary usage. I don't mean that in Scripture hope is a desire for something bad (insteadof something good). And I don't mean that in Scripture hope is rejectionof good (instead of desire for it). It is not the opposite in those senses. It is the opposite in this sense: ordinarily when we use the word hope weexpress uncertainty rather than certainty. "I hope daddy gets home early," means, "I don't have any certainty that daddywill get home on time, I only desire that he does." "Our hope is that Jim will arrive safely," means, "We don't know if he willor not, but that is our desire." "A good tailwind is our only hope of arriving on time," means, "A good tailwindwould bring us our desired goal, but we can't be sure we will get one." Ordinarily, when we express hope we are expressing uncertainty. But thisis NOT the distinctive, Biblical meaning of hope. And the main thing I wantto do this morning is show you from Scripture that Biblical hope is not justa desire for something good in the future, but rather, Biblical hope is:        A confident expectation and desire       for something good in the future.  Biblical hope not only desires something good for the future, it expectsit to happen. And it not only expects it to happen, it is confident thatit will happen. There is a moral certainty that the good we expect and desirewill be done. Before we look at the Scripture let me say what I mean by "moral certainty."It is different from, say mathmatical or merely logical certainty. Mathmatical,or strictly logical certainty results from the necessity of non-moral laws.If we have two apples and add two more, we may be "mathmatically" certainthat we now have four apples. That is mathmatical certainty. If all men aremortal and if Plato was a man, then we may be "logically" certain that Platowas mortal. That is logical certainty. That kind of thinking is important. In fact, it is indispensible in Biblicalstudies as well as all other areas of life. But most of our experience isnot like that. There is a kind of legitimate certainty and confidence thatdoes not come from mathmatical calculations or merely logical laws. I callit "moral certainty." I call it moral because it is rooted in the commitment of the will of persons.And the will is the seat of morality. That is, we can only speak of moralright and wrong in relationship to acts of will. So whatever has to do withthe will is an issue of morality. And moral certainty is a certainty thatis based on acts of will. Let me illustrate. I have a strong moral certainty that Noel and I are goingto stay married to each other as long as we live. This is based not onmathmatical laws or merely logical syllogisms. It is based on the characterof our wills and the promises of God -- which are just expressions of thecharacter of his will. We have almost 20 years of evidence about the natureand commitments of our wills and the graciousness of God's will. When we speak of our future, we do not speak in the ordinary terms of hope.We don't say, for example, "We hope that we don't get divorced." We speakin terms of confidence and certainty, because the character of a God-centeredwill is like iron. But of course we could be wrong, couldn't we. Yes, and all the communistsin the world may convert to Christianity this afternoon. And it may be thatnot a single deceptive word will creep into any advertisement for the nextfive years. And every pornographic publisher may go out of businessby year'send because men will gain mastery over their lustful desires. All these things are mathmatically and logically possible. There is nomathematical or logical certainty that they won't happen. Why then do wehave such strong confidence that they will not happen? Because we know somethingabout the human will. There is a kind of certainty that comes from knowingthe character of a man or of a group of men or a wife. It is not infallible,but it is secure and confident. It lets you sleep at night. It carries youover rough times. Eventually, it can see you right through the grave. Biblical hope is not a mere desire for something good to happen. It is Aconfident expectation and desire for something good in the future. Biblicalhope has moral certainty in it. When the Word says, "Hope in God!" it doesnot mean, "Cross your fingers." It means, to use the words of William Carey,"Expect great things from God." Now let us go to the Scripture to see where I get this understanding of Biblicalhope. We will begin at Hebrews 6:9-12. After warning his readers that itis possible for people who have had remarkable religious experiences to commitapostasy and go beyond the point of no return, he says, Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better thingsthat belong to salvation. For God is not so unjust as to overlook your workand the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as youstill do. And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizingthe full assurance of hope until the end, so that you may not be sluggish,but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. The reason the writer is so sure that his readers will not be among the apostatesis that they have not only been loving servants for God's sake in the pastbut are still serving. You see that emphasis on perseverance, don't you,at the end of verse 10: You showed love in serving the saints in the past,AND YOU STILL DO. Their religious experience was not a temporary decisionat camp or at a Keith Green concert or Billy Graham crusade. It was continuing.Perseverance in godliness is the proof of the genuineness of a person'ssalvation. That's why the writer feels so sure of the people: they had servedthe saints and they still do. Now comes the admonition in verses 11 and 12 to press on and not become sluggish.But the now the battle is described in terms of hope, not just in terms oflove and service: And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing thefull assurance of hope until the end. In other words, with all the zeal of the past that enabled you to work andlove in the name of Christ -- with all that zeal keep on pursuing the fullassurance of hope to the end. There is no fight, no quest, no challenge,no war more urgent than this. Keep your hope hot! Now what does "the full assurance of hope" mean in verse ll? It means hopewhich is fully assured. Hope which is confident. Hope that has moral certaintyin it. It is not finger-crossing hope. It is not the lip-biting gaze as youwatch the place kicker go for a field-goal in the last 10 seconds when youare down by two points. In fact, verse 12 implies that hope and faith are almost synonymous. Noticethe connection: verse 11 says, Go hard after full assurance of hope; verse12 says the result of that pursuit of hope is that you will be like thosewho through faith and patience inherit the promises. Pursue hope so thatyou can be like men of faith. Let's pursue this connection between hope and faith a little further. Theterm "full assurance" (used here in verse 11, plerophorian) is found oneother place in Hebrews, namely 10:22. However, there it is "full assuranceof faith" instead of "full assurance of hope". It says, "Let us draw nearwith a true heart in full assurance of faith." Then in the next verse itsays, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, forhe who promised is faithful." Notice, hope is something that should not waver, because it is rooted inthe faithfulness of God. There should be moral certainty in it because thewill and purpose of God are like iron not chalk. But what about the relationship between full assurance of faith and fullassurance of hope? Is there a difference? I would suggest that faith is thelarger idea and hope is a necessary part of Biblical faith. Hope is the thatpart of faith that focusses on the future. In Biblical terms, when faithis directed to the future you can call it hope. But faith can focus on thepast and the present too, so faith is the larger term. You can see this in Hebrews 11:1. This is the closest thing we have to definitionof faith in all the New Testament, I think. Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of thingsnot seen. Here's how I would paraphrase this verse. Wherever there is full assuranceof hope there is faith. Faith is the full assurance of hope. Biblical faithis a confident expectation and desire for good things in the future. But faith is more than that. It is also the "conviction of things not seen,"and some of these are not future. For example, verse three: "By faith weunderstand that the world was created by the word of God." Faith can lookback (to creation) as well as forward. So faith is the larger idea. It includeshope, but is more than hope. You might put it this way: faith is our confidencein the Word of God, and whenever that Word has reference to the future youcan call our confidence in it hope. Hope is faith in the future tense. There are two reasons this is important to see. 1. One is that it helps us grasp the true nature of Biblical hope. Most ofus know that Biblical faith is a strong confidence. Doubt is the enemy ofBiblical faith. But if hope is faith in the future tense, then we can seemore clearly that hope, too, is a strong confidence and not just wishfulthinking. 2. The other reason it is important to see this relationship between faithand hope is that it shows how indispensible hope is. We all know that weare saved by grace through faith. Faith is necessary for our salvation. Butwe don't as often speak of hope in those terms. But we should. Hope is anessential part of faith. Take away hope and the definition of faith in Hebrews11:1 is destroyed. We are not merely saved by grace through faith. We aresaved by grace through hope. Now briefly let's notice how Paul shares this same view of hope in Romans4:18. He describes Abraham as the great example of faith, and in particualar,of justification by faith. In Romans 4:22 he says, "This is why Abraham'sfaith was 'reckoned to him as righteousness'." And the faith Paul is speakingabout is the faith that God would fulfil his promise by giving him a son,Isaac. So the faith which justified Abraham was faith in the future work of God.Verse 21 makes this crystal clear: he was "fully convinced that God was ableto do what he had promised." In other words he had what Hebrews 6:11 calledthe "full assurance of hope." Verse 18 describes how faith and hope worked together: "In hope he believedagainst hope, that he should become the father of many nations." "Against hope" means that from the ordinary human standpoint there was nohope: Abraham was too old to have a child, and his wife was barren. But Biblicalhope is never based on what is possible with man. Biblical hope looks awayfrom man to the promise of God. And when it does, it becomes the "full assuranceof hope" --the expectation of great things from God. It is not easy to describe exactly what Paul means in verse 18 when he says,"In hope Abraham believed...that he should become the father of many nations."But from the whole context I think it is fair to say that        Abraham's faith was his strong confidence in the reliability of God's Word,    and       Abraham's hope was his strong confidence in the fulfilment of God's promise.  In other words, whenever faith in God looks to the future it can be calledhope. And whenever hope rests on the word of God it can be called faith. Therefore I pray that the main point of the message is plain from Hebrewsand from Romans, namely, that the Biblical concept of hope, that we are goingto be examining for the next 16 weeks, is not the ordinary concept we usein everyday speech. It does not imply uncertainty or lack of assurance. InsteadBiblical hope is        A confident expectation and desire       for something good in the future       There is moral certainty in it.  I count it a great privilege and delight to spend the next 16 weeks withyou unfolding what it means to say that our God is a "God of hope" (Romans15:13) and that the central exhortation of our church is very simply andvery profoundly, "HOPE IN GOD!"
