 October 25, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       HOW THE SAINTS MINISTER TO THE BODY    (Ephesians 4:7-16)         But to each one of us grace was given according to      the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, "When He      ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives, and He      gave gifts to men." (Now this expression, "He ascended," what      does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower      parts of the earth? He who descended is Himself also He who      ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all      things.) And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets,      and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for      the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the      building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the      unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to      a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to      the fulness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be      children, tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by      every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness      in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are      to grow up in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even      Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held      together by that which every joint supplies, according to the      proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of      the body for the building up of itself in love.                Last week we used this text to answer the question: Why the   saints minister to the body of Christ. That is, to what end or to   what goal do we do our ministry in the church? The answer came out   in three ways.        One was that the aim of our ministry is the upbuilding of the   body. Verse 12: Christ gives leaders to the church (like pastors   and teachers) "for the equipping of the saints for the work of   service (or ministry), to the building up of the body of Christ."   So the aim of our ministry is building up the body. Not just the   individual members of the body but the body as a whole.        Second, the aim of our ministry is the unity of faith and the   unity of the knowledge of the Son of God. Verse 13: "...until we   all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the   Son of God." So our aim is to keep on building up the body until   there is unity in our faith and unity in our knowledge of   Christ.        Third, the aim of ministry is that the body of Christ attain a   corporate personality of Christ-likeness. Verse 13b: (keep on   building up the body) "until we all attain to the unity of the   faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to   the measure of the stature which belongs to the fulness of   Christ." In other words the aim of ministry is not just that   individuals be built up, but that the body of Christ attain to a   mature man (not men, but man).        Christ is the head of the body and he is fully mature and   complete. The church is his body, and we are not fully mature and   complete. The aim of ministry is to build the church and to cause   it to grow up into the kind of maturity that corresponds to   Christ. The aim of ministry is corporate likeness to Christ. A   kind of corporate personality that is like Jesus.        That much we saw last week. We passed over verse 14 and so we   should add this week (as a fourth part of our aim in ministry)   that this corporate likeness to Christ in verse 13 has definite   implications for us as individuals. It results in our not being   gullible and unstable. Verse 14: "As a result, we are no longer to   be children, tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by   every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in   deceitful scheming."        When the whole body is building itself up in corporate likeness   to the maturity of Christ, the effect is that the members of the   body in that process become discerning and perceptive and stable.   They have their faculties trained to see through the subtle,   manipulative use of language that tricks people into affirming   things that are not true or right.        So one of the reasons why the saints minister to the body of   Christ is so that every member would become more astute and   penetrating and perceptive and stable, and less gullible and   credulous and unthinking.        This is tremendously relevant in a politically charged year   like this one. For example, are you babes in listening to the   candidates, blown about by the subtle, political exploitation of   Scripture? Or are you mature and discriminating? Can you tell the   difference between what the Bible means and the almost blasphemous   misuse of it for political purposes.        For example, in January President Bush sacrificed the meaning   of Matthew 5:14 on the altar of national pride, when he said to   the National Religious Broadcasters in defense of the Gulf war, "I   want to thank you for helping America, as Christ ordained, to be a   light unto the world." What that amounts to is an outrageous   distortion of Jesus' meaning. That misuse of Scripture is designed   for immature babes that are easily swayed by surface words without   thought and discernment. The "light of the world" in Matthew 5:14   does not refer to Americans bombing Iraq no matter how justified   the war may have been.        Governor Clinton refused to be outdone in this torture of   Scripture. At the democratic convention he exploited the precious   Biblical vision of the New Covenant, sealed by the blood of the   Son of God, into a political vision that stood the Biblical   reality right on its head. His worst misuse of the Bible was when   he mangled 1 Corinthians 2:9, "Scripture says: 'Our eyes have not   seen, nor our ears heard nor our minds imagined what we can   build.'" Now that is emphatically not what the text says. A   glorious promise of what God has prepared for those who love him,   was prostituted into a Biblically sanctioned endorsement of human   effort.        Now this sort of thing is rampant, and not only when the words   of the Bible are brought in to exploit the religious sentiments of   the American people. You are being urged to endorse wrong and   embrace error almost everywhere you turn with words that are so   sly they can be given a surface defence when a moment's thought   shows the real agenda. Christ does not want the members of his   body to be babes in these things, blown about by "the trickery of   men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming."        For example, in the halls of Roosevelt High I saw official,   school-sponsored posters that were clearly endorsing   homosexuality, but in a most subtle way. One said, "One in ten   people are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. They could be your brother,   sister, parent, or friend." This is tricky. First of all the 10%   figure has been discredited. A University of Chicago study   suggests 1%. The National Center for Health Statistics estimates   3%. William Simon with the Kinsey Institute estimates 2-3%. So   first, the numbers are inflated to make the students feel   overwhelmed.        Then, with no moral assessment of the behavior, the emotional   appeal is made that your parent might be homosexual. The net   effect of lodging that surface truth in a teenager's mind is not   to encourage careful moral reasoning based on durable standards of   right and wrong. It simply implies to him that he should process   this whole issue with statistics and feelings.        The other poster is even more subtle and forceful. It said,   "Respect sees no color, gender, sexual orientation, religion   disability." There are at least two serious problems with this   public morality statement. One is that it puts homosexuality in   the same category with gender and race. In doing that it short   circuits the whole issue of whether homosexual behavior is right   or wrong, and it implies that it is right (it doesn't say it   outright). Acting like a male or a female is a matter of   indifference; and acting like a black or a white person is a   matter of indifference; so acting like a homosexual or a   heterosexual is a matter of indifference. The endorsement is   implicit and subtle, but very real and very powerful.        The other problem with this poster is that it bases respect on   what one doesn't see instead of what one does see. "Respect sees   no color, gender, etc." The result is that the positive foundation   of respect is missing and there is no wonder that students see   little reason for it. No reason has been given. The first ground   of respect is that every person has been created in the image of   God, no matter what. So you can even have a kind of respect for a   murderer, by holding him accountable and punishing him, unlike you   would do with a snake if it killed a man. But in every day life   there are different degrees and different kinds of respect, and   these are emphatically based on what we see. And gender does   matter--there is a courtesy that men ought to show women that is   distinct from the way they treat men. They ought not to walk into   the women's locker room. And the only way to affirm that form of   special respect for women is to see gender and to honor it.   Religion matters too--we should have less respect for a person   whose religion is Satanism and who engages in satanic ritual   abuse, than we do, say, for a Jewish person who strives to live by   the ten commandments.        Now the point of all this is not to make life hard for those   who struggle against homosexual temptation. I stand with you in   that struggle, not against you. I count you among the most   courageous people in our society when you say, "Yes, this is how I   feel, and I am against it. That is not my main identity. I will   resist those temptations and will not build my life on that   reality."        The point rather is simply to show you how tremendously   relevant this passage is today. Everywhere you turn your   discernment is being tested--are you a babe being carried along by   politicians who manipulate Scripture? are you a babe being shaped   by posters that subtly endorse an immoral agenda? are you a babe   being formed and guided by TV advertisers that plant assumptions   and desires in your mind?--or are you growing up with the body of   Christ into the maturity and discernment and stability of Christ   in the truth?        Today's question is: How does this happen? How do we minister   to each other so that the body grows up into corporate   Christ-likeness? How do we minister so that unity of faith and   knowledge emerges? How do we minister so that babes become keen,   perceptive, discerning saints?        The answer I want to develop is found in verses 15 and 16.   Verse 15 we will unfold this morning and we'll focus on verse 16   tonight. Verse 15 gives the heart of the answer, and verse 16   spells it out in at least five ways.        Verse 15 says, "Speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up   in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ." The plain   answer to how we grow into Christ--how we become corporately like   Christ and take on the measure of the stature of the fulness of   Christ--is right here: we speak the truth in love. "Speaking the   truth in love, we grow . . ." Speaking the truth in love is HOW we   build the body up.        Let me clear up a wrong idea here that I had for years about   this phrase because I ignored the context. I used to think that   the phrase, "speak the truth in love" meant, "Tell it like it is,   but gently." Like: if a student bombed a test or if a man loses   his job, you may have to do the tough work of telling them the   truth, but you do it in love to soften the blow. So the truth   which is in view here, I thought, was just the hard facts of life   that a person might need to hear about in love.        Well, that is no doubt part of the meaning here (especially in   view of Eph. 4:25) but the context points in a different   direction, that is very crucial to see for the good of the church.   The context is all about doctrinal truth--truth about God and   about his Son. Notice three evidences of this.        First the equippers of the saints in verse 11 are all truth   agents: apostles (the authoritative, foundational witnesses to the   truth), the prophets (the charismatic speakers of truth that apply   it with supernaturally guided pointedness), the evangelists (who   do the work of evangelism with the truth of the gospel in regions   where apostles have planted the church), the pastors and teachers   (who take the truth and use it to feed and protect the flock of   God). Everyone of these offices centers on the truth of God and   Christ and the gospel. These people are truth agents.        Second, verse 13 says that the goal of building up the body of   Christ is to attain to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of   the Son of God. So the building begins with equippers who are all   agents of truth, and the aim of the building is unified knowledge,   that is, unified grasp of truth.        Third, we have seen that verse 14 shows Paul's great concern is   that as we grow into corporate Christ-likeness we are not to be   babes who are blown around by every wind of doctrine. So again the   issue is stability in true doctrine so that we will not be   deceived by false doctrine.        In view of these three points: (1) the body is built up through   equippers who are all truth agents; (2) the aim of the upbuilding   is a unified vision of truth about the Son of God; and (3) the aim   is also for individuals to be mature in their ability to use truth   to avoid error--in view of this context, "speaking the truth" in   verse 15 must mean "speaking truth about God and about Christ and   about the gospel." In other words, it means speaking Biblical   truth, spiritual truth, truth about life as God sees it.        So how do the saints minister to the body? Answer: by speaking   truth about God and about Christ in love. Both are crucial.   Knowledge and love. Knowledge without love puffs up, Paul said (1   Cor. 8:1). But love without knowledge is confused and aimless, and   disintegrates into sentimentality. That's why Paul prays in   Philippians 1:9 "that your love might abound more and more in all   knowledge and discernment." Love abounding in knowledge and   discernment is what builds the body of Christ.        One of the main reasons people come to Bethlehem is because we   put a premium on speaking Biblical truth. God has honored it. May   we never minimize it. But one of the reasons for this series of   messages is that we are not as strong in the other half--namely,   speaking the truth to one another IN LOVE. We as leaders long to   see God bring this balance to us in such a way that the whole body   grows into the measure of the stature of the fulness of   Christ.        Paul packs five practical ways to do this into verse 16, and   that's what we look at tonight.        October 25, 1992 p.m. service notes         Lesson on Ephesians 4:16         Why minister to the body?               (v.12) for upbuilding              (v. 13) unified faith and knowledge              (v. 13) corporate personality of Christ-likeness              (v. 14) no longer babes              (3:10) glory of God's wisdom            We minister by speaking the truth in love (v. 15) &#91;see also   2 Pet. 3:17-18&#93;.        How do we minister (from v. 16):        1. By relying on Christ as the source of growth ("from   whom..."               Christ gave gifts and grace to all (v.7)              Christ gave equippers to the church (v. 11)              Christ is the model and aim (v. 13) to guide and as      inspiration              "I will build my church" (Matt. 16:18)              The Lord produces love (1 Thes. 3:12; Gal. 5:22)              Christ wins obedience through word and deed (Rom.      15:18)            2. "The whole body . . . makes the growth of the body"        The question seen from v. 12 is: do equippers minister      or do the saints minister?               Saints (note the change in preposition, the "whole body,"      "each single part" (v. 16d)              Do you feel responsible to speak the truth in love?            3. The body makes growth by connectedness ("joined and knit   together 





 through every joint   for supply")               Joint: may be every place of connection (from part to part)      not every bone connection (elbow, shoulder, etc.) as we know      it.              Point: growth happens through points of contact. Corporate      building happens through connectedness.              The supply is Truth &amp; Love            4. "The working in measure of each individual part" (v.16d)               not just all; but every individual              in measure (v.7): we do not have the same measure             see also Romans 12:3 as God measured a measure of      faith.             5. Upbuilding of itself (through/from Christ) but we do make a   difference (v.16f)        6. Do it in love (v.16g)               1 Cor. 8:1 - love builds up              2 Cor. 12:19 - we speak...and all, beloved, for your      upbuilding            So the exhortation is this: speak the truth to one another in   love, relying on Christ as the source, for he makes the whole body   grow. Do more than just pray...speak to one another, and encourage   one another.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
