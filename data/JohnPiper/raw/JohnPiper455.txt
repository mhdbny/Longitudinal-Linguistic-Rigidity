      October 22, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church   Volume 5    Praying for All His Purposes; Meditatingon All His Word   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document   The Spiritual Dynamic (Part 3)       Introduction: The Sieve of My Life     I want you to know what this MissionStatement is meaning for me  personally in these days. On Wednesday I spoke over at theNorthwestern College chapel  service. As I prepared I was gripped by our mission and felt thatwhen I go away from  Bethlehem to minister other places I must be an emissary of whatwe as a church stand for.  So I began my talk on living by faith in future grace by saying,         My mission this morning is to spread apassion for the supremacy of God    in all things for the joy of all peoples, and I am here torecruit people to share that    mission and that passion with me.       This Wednesday I am going down to Wheaton todebate Ruth Tucker on  What the Bible Says about the Family. (Please pray forme.) And I am going to  stand in Pierce Chapel and begin the same way I began lastWednesday:         My mission tonight as I talk about what theBible says about the family    is to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all thingsfor the joy of all peoples.    I care about the family and the biblical dynamics of lovebetween husbands and wives for    one main reason: because they are meant by God to manifest hisglory in the world for the    joy of his creatures. And that is what my church exists for andwhy they send me out on    these ventures.       In other words already this Mission Statementis giving a sharpened  focus and an energizing unity to my life and ministry. We exist --and therefore I as a  leader in this church exist -- to spread a passion for thesupremacy of God in all things  for the joy of all peoples. Everything passes through that sieve.If it doesn&#146;t do  that, I don&#146;t do it. At least that&#146;s my goal. My prayeris that more and more of  you will be drawn into that same passion.     Review     But how do you do that? That&#146;s whatpage two is meant to  answer -- The Spiritual Dynamic that drives our Mission.Let&#146;s read it together:                   We join God the Father                 in magnifying the supremacy of His glory                through our Lord Jesus Christ,                in the power of the Holy Spirit by                 treasuring  all that God is,                 loving  all whom He loves,                 praying  for all His purposes,                 Meditating  on all His word,                sustained by all His  grace .                     This is our third Sunday unpacking thisSpiritual Dynamic and trying to  show that it is rooted in Scripture. The first couple lines repeatthe Mission: to join  God the Father in magnifying the supremacy of his glory.That&#146;s our goal in all we do  -- to show how great God is!    Then we talked about how this is only possiblethrough our Lord  Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christdied for our sins so  that God&#146;s justice could be satisfied, and his wrath could beremoved, and the curse  could be lifted from us and our sins could be forgiven and therighteousness of Christ  himself could be imputed to us and God could look upon us, even inour imperfection, as a  loved child, and so pour out his Holy Spirit into our lives andgive us the patient,  loving help that we need to live out our mission. We cannot liveout our mission without  pardon   from Jesus and  power  from the Holy Spirit.    Then last week we took up the next two phrasesand asked, how do we  connect with the pardon of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit.And the biblical answer  was through faith. By grace are you saved through faith ,  the Bible says (Eph. 2:8). It also says that God supplies the HolySpirit to us not by  works of the law but by hearing  with faith  (Gal. 3:5). Butwe have used the words,  by treasuring all that God is rather than the wordsby faith  because we believe that is what faith means.    Faith is not just accepting a fact about God orJesus. Faith is  treasuring all that God promises to be for you in Jesus. The word,treasuring,  gets at the heart. Faith is a matter of the heart as well as themind. Faith assents to  truth about God with the mind, and it embraces, or cherishes ortreasures the reality of  God with the heart.     And I tried to show that this is why faithalways produces love --  which is the next phrase in the Spiritual Dynamic -- lovingall whom he loves.  When your heart is satisfied by treasuring all that God is for youin Jesus, the power of  selfishness is broken. To the degree that you rest in the treasureof God, you are freed  from fear and greed and lust and despondency and bitterness andimpatience and conceit and  shame -- all of the things that keep you from being a person forothers.    Love, we said, was faith made visible. Faith isinvisible. But when it  frees to live for the good of others, it becomes visible in love.And love is what most of  our fresh initiatives on page 3 are all about.     Faith Comes By Hearing . . . the Word ofChrist     But now the question rises: Where doesfaith come from? Or: How do  you become a person who treasures all that God is for you inJesus? If faith works through  love (Gal. 5:6), and love causes people to magnify our Father inheaven (Matthew 5:16),  then the great question in life is, how shall we have this faith?How shall we come to  treasure God like this?    One answer is given in Romans 10:14-17.           How then shall they call upon Him in whomthey have not believed?    And how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard? Andhow shall they hear    without a preacher?  15  And how shall they preach unlessthey are sent?. . .  17  So     faith comes from hearing , and hearing by the word ofChrist.        There is Paul&#146;s answer: faith comesby hearing, and hearing  by the word of Christ. This is why our Spiritual Dynamicincludes the phrase,  meditating on all His Word. Prayer has a crucial roleto play too, which is  why we say, praying for all His Purposes. For example,in Psalm 119:18 the  psalmist prays like this:      Open my eyes, that I may beholdwonderful things from Thy law .      In other words the Word of God containswonderful things, but we will  not see them without God&#146;s help -- his illumination (2Corinthians 4:4,6); his  opening our hearts like he did for Lydia (Acts 16:14); his openingour minds like he did  for the apostles (Luke 24:45). And if we miss what is in the wordof God without his help,  then prayer becomes the natural partner to hearing the word. Wepray,  Open my  eyes that I may see wonderful things from your law .    We are going to spend two Sundays on prayerduring prayer week at the  beginning of the year (nine weeks from now). So I want us to focuson this other line in  our spiritual dynamic this morning and tonight -- meditatingon all His Word.  We join God in magnifying the supremacy of his glory by . .. meditating on all His  Word. This is the way faith begins and the way faith grows --by hearing and  meditating on the word of God. And as faith grows -- as we come totreasure more and more  what God is for us in Jesus -- we have more and more freedom andstrength to love as we  ought. And when we love as we ought, people will see our gooddeeds and give glory to our  Father in heaven. And our mission will be fulfilled.    So let&#146;s ponder these simple words for therest of our time this  morning: . . . by meditating on all His Word. When wesay His we  mean God&#146;s. And by God&#146;s Word we mean theBible -- the sixty-six  books of the Old and New Testament. Why do we believe that theBible is the Word of God?     The answer to that question is very important,and it&#146;s not  exactly the same for every person. All of us don&#146;t getpersuaded in the very same  way. But at the heart of the answer for all of us, I believe, isthis:  Jesus Christ, as  he is presented in the New Testament, has won our trust and wehave embraced his view of  the Bible as we have his view of everything else he talks about.     In other words we are persuaded that Jesusis such a powerful  historical figure that nothing has been able to conceal him in histrue glory. He has  broken through every human limitation and revealed himself as soauthentic, and so loving,  and so penetratingly wise, and so uniquely authoritative, and sodevoted to God, and so  powerful in words and deeds that there is none like him. In thisway he has won our trust.  And this we embrace in view of the Scriptures.     Can We Trust the Bible?     From time to time we allow ourselves toask: Is the portrait of  Jesus that we have in the New Testament a result of fanaticaldelusion? Did some religious  zealots hallucinate and create the teachings and deeds and deityand atoning death and  resurrection of Jesus? Is this magnificent Christ just the frothof unstable minds?     Or we ask: is this portrait an intentionaldeception and fraud that  some group shrewdly conceived and foisted onto the world? Was it akind of plot? One they  were willing die for, strangely.    Or we ask: is there only a tiny kernel of truthin this portrait of  Jesus, which within a few years had been so overgrown withexaggerated tales that no one  could ever get back to the real Jesus of history? Which would meanthat the magnificence  of this person that we meet in the New Testament is really themagnificence of some  people&#146;s imagination with no valid cause greater than anordinary man?    And when we let ourselves ask these questionswe come back again and  again to this: these witnesses do not have the flavor ofhallucination or fraud or  indifference to truth. And the portrait of Jesus that comesthrough is gloriously  authentic and filled with insight that illuminates all of realitythat I know. And  therefore I believe him. And when he teaches that he is thefulfillment and center of the  Scriptures I believe that too, and conclude that they are indeed,as he says, the Word of  God (Matthew 5:17-18; 19:4-5; Mark 12:36; John 10:35).    We need to pause here so you can make thispersonal. It is not  academic. Your life hangs on this. Does Jesus stand forth from theNew Testament witness  as an authentic and glorious person worthy of your trust andworship, or doesn&#146;t he?  If he does, believe him; treasure him above all things; bow andworship him. If he does  not (yet!), don&#146;t play games with Christianity. Don&#146;tcall yourself a Christian  for convenience, or because you don&#146;t want to scare yourwife, or because you are  afraid of hell. Instead give yourself to prayer that God wouldhelp you see what is really  there.    Believing that the Bible is the Word of God isa gigantic event in the  soul. Therefore God does not leave it merely to man. He himself isinvolved every time  someone comes to believe in the Word of God.     Let me illustrate this from one of Paul&#146;sletters, 1 Thessalonians  2:13,           We also constantly thank God that when youreceived from us the word    of God's message, you accepted it not as the word of men, butfor what it really is, the    word of God, which also performs its work in you whobelieve .       The main thing to see here is that Paul thanks God  constantly    that the Thessalonians received the teaching of the apostlesas the Word of God, and  not merely the word of man. What this shows is that if we are leftto ourselves, we will  not see Jesus in this Word as self-authenticating and trustworthyand glorious. We will  just hear religious opinion -- the way some people stand on theedge of the grand canyon  and just see a big ditch.    So our answer to the question, Why do webelieve that the Bible  is the Word of God? is this: through the witness of the NewTestament Jesus Christ  stands forth as an authentic and glorious person worthy of ourtrust and worship -- he  breaks through every human limitation and commends himself to ourmind and our conscience.  What he is and what he does and what he says illumines reality --it helps make sense out  of the world. But the bottom line answer to why we believe theBible is the Word of God is  the same one Paul gave in 1 Thessalonians 2:13 -- God revealedhimself to us in the word.  God opened our eyes. God took away our blindness and overcame ourresistance. To God  belongs all the glory even for our seeing his glory.     The Word of God in the Life of Bethlehem     Now we believe that the Bible is the Wordof God. Which raises the  question, What shall we do with it? The answer of the Elders andthe Master Planning Team  was: We will base our values on it and saturate our values with itand make it the  authoritative litmus test for all things at Bethlehem BaptistChurch. For example. That  is, we will be a people of the Book.    For example, look at page 5, ValuesRelating To Bethlehem&#146;s  Spiritual Atmosphere. We value . . .         3. Personal  Bible  reading, reflectionand memorization among all    our people.      5. The indispensable role of teachers andparents to impart  Biblical     truth to the mind, and the indispensable role of the Holy Spiritto awaken love for truth    in the heart.      6. Keeping the main things the main things.Maintaining  Biblical     proportion between the importance of a truth and the attentionand energy devoted to it:.      7. The study of sound  Biblical theology so that we will not be    children in our thinking.      8. Being people who are humble and teachablebefore the  Word of God ,    always growing and being refined in our grasp of God&#146;struth and grace      9. All services, committees, small groups,and relationships permeated    with the  Word of God .      11.  Biblical  self-denial as we takethought for the good of    others.      19. Efficient administrative structuresshaped by  the Word  and    sustained by prayer.       That is our aim as a church. What does it meanfor each of us as  individuals? It means that we will want to be like the psalmist inPsalm 1.          1 How blessed is the man who does notwalk in the counsel of the    wicked,         Nor stand in the path of sinners,         Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!         2 But his delight is in the law of theLORD,         And in His law he meditates day andnight.         3 And he will be like a tree firmly  planted by    streams of water,         Which yields its fruit in its season,        And its leaf does not wither; And inwhatever he does, he prospers.        We want to be a people who meditate on the Wordof God day and night.  We want to be like Charles Spurgeon who said,          It is blessed to eat into the very soul ofthe Bible, until at last you    come to talk in Scriptural language, and your spirit is flavoredwith the words of the    Lord, so that your blood is Bibline and the very essence of theBible flows from you.    (Quoted in John R. Stott,  The Preacher&#146;s Portrait [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,    1961], pp. 30-31)       How we do that and what it means to meditate onthe Lord day and night  is what we will talk about tonight.
