  March 30, 1986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning Pastor John Piper Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   THE MARVELOUS RISING OF A REJECTED STONE  Matthew 21:42 "The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes."    Last fall Charles Colson was in India. As usual, the crowds he spoke to wanted  to hear the testimony of this Watergate criminal turned prison evangelist.  Here's the way he described his experience in India:        When I was in India last fall I had many opportunities to tell what Christ  has done in my life. The thousands of faces in those predominantly Hindu  crowds would nod and smile as I shared my experience. Hindus believe all  roads lead to God -- if Jesus was my guru, that was fine. They all had their  gurus, too.        But when I spoke of the reason for my faith, the resurrection of Christ,  the nods would stop. People's expressions changed and they listened intently.  The fact of the Resurrection demands a choice, one that reduces all other  religions to mere philosophies.     (Christianity Today, March 21, 1986, p. 72)        Christianity socks you between the eyes because it is a religion that says:  The really marvelous things in life are not the feelings of the heart but  the facts of history. There is a world of difference between a subjective  religious disposition and an objective resurrection from the dead.     Put yourself in Athens 25 years after the death of Jesus. You are a religious  pluralist. You love to discuss religion. You love to hear about the religious  experience of people from all over the world. It's fascinating. Sometimes  you even learn something to incorporate into your own life to help you get  along better.     Then one day comes a man named Paul to the Areopagus and joins in the  discussions. You ask him about his religion. Suppose he said,     I worship Jesus Christ. He was a Jewish teacher and wonder-worker. He lived  in Palestine 25 years ago and taught a way of love and truth. His wisdom  was unsurpassed. Even in his dying he never gave in to the lower instincts  of anger and revenge. His memory is very powerful. His teachings linger on  in his followers. His example can have a tremendous influence in your life  if you meditate on what he did and said.     Period. That's all.     What would the response have been? Tolerance. Benign interest, perhaps. Nods  and smiles of respect. Paul has his guru. The Athenians have their gurus.  If it works for you, fine. You have your inner experience. I have mine.     But what if he had said (which he did in fact say, in Acts 17:31!),     "The God who made the world and everything in it ... commands all men everywhere  to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in  righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance  to all men by raising him from the dead"?     Well, that is not acceptable in a polite, respectful dialogue about religious  experience. Discussions about the relative value of religious experience  and declarations about someone's's resurrection from the dead are just not  in the same category. That's why the Hindus stopped nodding at Charles Colson.  That's why Athenians mocked. That's why Christianity is offensively unique  in a pluralistic age. For us everything hangs on a marvelous fact in history,  not a marvelous feeling in the heart.     Therefore, in this Easter worship service I want to direct your attention  to four marvelous facts in Matthew 21:42. We will approach it like this.  We will read a word from Jesus. Then we will read its interpretation by the  apostle Peter. Then we will fix our gaze on four marvelous things in Jesus'  word.     The word of the Lord is found in Matthew 21:42 at the end of the parable  of the wicked tenants. The owner of the vineyard had sent servants to get  fruit from the tenants. They had beaten some and killed others. Then he sent  his son. But him, too, they cast out and killed.     The meaning is that God owns the vineyard of Israel. It is supposed to bear  the fruit of worship and obedience. He has sent prophets and wise men to  gather this fruit. And finally he sent his Son. But the leaders of Israel  rebel. They will give no fruit. And they kill the Son of God.     Then comes our text in verse 42:     Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the scriptures: 'The very stone  which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the  Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"     It seems obvious to you, I am sure, what this refers to, but lets go straight  to the interpretation of the apostle Peter in Acts 4:8-12. Peter and John  had been arrested for causing a stir by healing a man and teaching about  the resurrection of Jesus from the dead (4:2-3). The next day the Jewish  leaders (the very ones who had condemned Jesus some months earlier) asked  them by what power they were acting. Peter answers, and his answer is an  interpretation of Jesus' word about the rejected stone. Starting at the end  of verse 8:     Rulers of the people and elders, if we are being examined today concerning  a good deed done to a cripple, by what means this man has been healed, be  it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of  Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead,  by him this man is standing before you well. This is the stone which was  rejected by you builders, but which has become the head of the corner. And  there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven  given among men by which we must be saved.     Notice Peter's interpretation, one part at a time.     Verse 10: the stone is Jesus Christ of Nazareth.     Verse 8: the builders are the rulers of the people and elders.     Verse 10: the rejection of the stone was the crucifixion of Jesus.     Verse 10: the elevation of the stone to the head of the corner was the  resurrection of Jesus.     Verse 12: the implication of this new position at the head is that there  is salvation in no other. This is the same point Paul made at the Areopagus:  the resurrection declares that Jesus is the Son of God in power: all must  repent from other gods and seek salvation in him alone.     That is Peter's interpretation of the word of Jesus in Matthew 21:42. Now  we will be able on the basis of this interpretation to go back to Jesus'word  and fix our gaze on four marvelous facts.     First, let us marvel at the fact that Jesus predicts his own resurrection  before it happens.     He had done this before this moment, and he would do it again. Sometimes  he made it plain, for example, when he said: "After I am raised up I will  go before you into Galilee" (Mark 14:28; Cf. Mark 8:31; 9:31; 10:34; 14:25).  But usually he spoke of it indirectly, for example, when he said, "Destroy  this temple and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2:19; Mark 14:58;  15:29; Matthew 26:61); or: "No sign will be give to this generation except  the sign of Jonah" (Matthew 16:4; 12:39; Cf. 12:41). He often spoke only  for those who had ears to hear.     The reason I point out the fact that Jesus predicted his own resurrection  is to sow a seed in your mind that I don't have time to develop today. The  seed is simply that it is impossible to admire Jesus as a wise and loving  teacher while rejecting him as your risen and living Master. It's impossible  because if he isn't the risen Master, then he was deluded or deceptive in  his life and teaching and so shouldn't be admired. He built his life around  a self-understanding that included his own resurrection. If he didn't rise,  he is to be pitied as a teacher not admired.     But someone may say, "Aren't you assuming that he said everything the Gospels  said that he did? Wouldn't the skeptic who rejects the resurrection but admires  Jesus say that the early church made up those sayings to make it look like  Jesus expected his own resurrection?"     The answer to that question is that no matter how much of the Gospels you  try to strip away as later additions, you never wind up with a mere man.  His claims to authority and power are so woven through his words and deeds  that critics are dreaming when they think they can peel the onion of supernatural  tradition down to the natural core of a mere man. He vanishes. Because a  mere, natural man named Jesus with a noble view of love never existed. The  Jesus of history knew he was no ordinary man, and we do well to marvel that  part of his self-understanding was the assurance that he would rise from  the dead. So we should marvel that Jesus predicted his resurrection before  it happened.     Second, let us marvel at the blindness of the builders.     "The very stone that the builders rejected has become the head of the corner."  It is an amazing thing that the people who should know stones best did not  recognize the best stone. Mark 6:6 says, "Jesus marveled because of their  unbelief." He said to Nicodemus, one of the "builders," "Are you a teacher  of Israel, and yet you do not understand this?" Jesus was astonished at the  blindness of those who should have been the first to recognize him from their  knowledge of the Old Testament.     And while we marvel at this let us learn a lesson. Even today there is no  guarantee that the "builders" -- the religious experts, the university  theologians, the clergy -- will recognize the stone.     Two years ago a sixty year old theology professor at the University of Leeds  in England was appointed Bishop of Durham. In the process he announced that  the Resurrection of Jesus was a "conjuring trick with bones." So here is  a "builder" who still is rejecting the stone.     Why should we be vigilant about such things in our own churches and colleges  and seminaries?     Two reasons:     One is that the bishop's words reached Moslems in Sri Lanka, half way around  the world. Immediately they began aggressive visitation campaigns to Christians  saying that there is no reason for conflict any more since Christians and  Moslems both agree now that Jesus was merely a prophet to be honored, not  the Son of God to be worshiped. One Anglican rector in Sri Lanka said, "They  are killing us with our bishop's own words." The "builders" are still rejecting  the corner stone and in many churches the walls and the mission are in disarray.     The other reason for us to be vigilant as we marvel at the blindness of the  builders is something that Iain Murray said recently. He said that the uproar  over the the Jenkins affair is puzzling since he has been teaching these  things to preparing ministers in the university for years and probably doing  more harm there than he can do now that he is a public figure and his cards  are on the table.     So let us marvel at the blindness of the builders. And let us learn that  academic stature has never been a guarantee of religious insight. And let  us be vigilant and examine or church leaders -- our pastors our deacons,  our board members, our Sunday School teachers -- let us examine them carefully  to see if they know and accept the stone which many builders have rejected.     Third, let us marvel that the stone which is Now at the head of the corner  is the very stone that was once rejected.     Or, to take the imagery away, we must marvel that it is a real man who now  reigns at the right hand of God. Yes, he is more than a man. He is the Son  of God in power. But the astonishing thing that we gaze at now is this: God  the Son came into the world and clothed himself with a human nature in order  to die for sinners like you and me. A divine nature and a human nature came  together in one Person. And when that Person rose from the dead and ascended  into heaven to take his place as the Head of the church and the King of the  world, at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, it was a man who went  into heaven. He was one of us. He is the same man reigning in heaven today  who ate and drank and taught and healed and suffered on earth. The very stone  which the builders rejected, THIS one is now head of the corner.     In Luke 24:36-43 the risen Christ appeared to the apostles. They were so  amazed that they thought they were seeing a ghost. So Jesus says,     Why are you troubled, and why do questions rise in your hearts? See my hands  and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for a spirit has not  flesh and bones as you see that I have.     And while they still disbelieved for joy, and marveled, he said to them,  "Have you anything here to eat?" And they gave him a piece of broiled fish,  and he took it and ate before them.     The risen Christ who reigns in heaven today and intercedes for us with the  Father is a rejected stone! He has flesh and bones! He is one of us. And  this truth contains good news for now and good news for later. For now it  means this:     We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,  but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning.  Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may  receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Hebrews 4:15-16)     For he too is a rejected stone with pierced hands and flesh and bone!     But not only that. This truth is also good news for the future. Get every  ethereal, ghost-like conception of the coming Kingdom out of your head. The  God man is not going to rule over invisible spirits and ghosts. "If the Spirit  of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ  Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies." We will eat broiled  fish in the Kingdom! We will hold it in our physical hands and stand on our  feet. And there will be no more wheel chairs or crutches or cancer or paralysis,  or leukemia or allergies or arthritis any more. For we will bear the image  of the Son of God, and we will see him and touch him and marvel at him for  ever and ever because the divine stone which is now at the head of the corner  is the very same human stone that was once rejected.     Fourth, let us marvel AT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE THE HEAD OF THE CORNER.     Paul saw it perhaps more clearly than anyone, and said,     God raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly  places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above  every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is  to come; and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head  over all things. (Ephesians 1:20-22)     So that Jesus could say,     "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18).     And Paul could preach in Athens with unwavering authority:     "God has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by  a man whom he has appointedf, and of this he has given assurance to all men  by raising him from the dead. (Acts 17:31)     Therefore, (as we return to Peter's interpretation of our text) "there is  salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among  men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).     O do not be like the builders this morning! Do not reject Jesus Christ. Do  not stumble over this rejected stone. The very stone which the builders rejected  has become the head of the corner. This is the Lord's doing and may it be  marvelous in your eyes. Amen.      Copyright 1996,1999 John Piper    Piper's Notes
