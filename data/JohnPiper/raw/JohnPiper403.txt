  March 27, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       Forgive just as God in Christ also has forgiven you    (Ephesians 4:32-5:2)        And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving      each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.      Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in      love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for      us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrantaroma.         Last week I talked about what forgiveness is -- what it looks   like and what it's not. I quoted Thomas Watson's definition which   included       1. resisting revenge,    2. not returning evil for evil,    3. wishing them well,    4. grieving at their calamities,    5. praying for their welfare,    6. seeking reconciliation so far as it depends on you,    7. and coming to their aid in distress.       Gospel-flying       This week I'm asking, how can we do that? What gives us the   freedom and the ability and the incentive and the power to forgive   those who sin against us? Some of you have been wronged so deeply   and hurt so badly that forgiving would be as great a miracle as   flying.       But recall the little poem of John Bunyan:       Run, John, run, the law commands    But gives us neither feet nor hands,    Far better news the gospel brings:    It bids us fly and gives us wings.       







Two wings, six   feathers       And that includes the "flying" of forgiveness. So I want God to   show us our gospel wings this morning. Forgiving is a flying you   can do in the power of the gospel. In fact six feathers are enough   for this flight -- three on one side and three on the other make   two strong wings for gospel-flying -- or gospel forgiving.       I find all six feathers in these three verses (Ephesians 4:32 -   5:2),        And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving      each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.      Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in      love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for      us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrantaroma.         There are two wings in this text for gospel-flying -- just like   a bird has two wings. Each wing has three feathers. All six   feathers are things God the Father and God the Son have done for   us without our help. They are all works of his sovereign grace. I   am talking to Christian believers now. If you are not one yet, I   hope you will listen and be drawn in. What I am describing here   about gospel-flying (forgiving) is yours freely if you will lay   down the weights of unbelief and trust Christ.       There are two wings. One wing with its three feathers is what   Christ did for us before we even existed. And the other wing with   its three feathers is what God did for us in our own lifetime. So   if you are drawing the sermon today, you need to draw a bird with   two big wings each having three feathers, and then write on each   feather one of the things God has done so that we can fly with   forgiveness to each other.       A. Wing #1: What God did for us before we even existed.       1. The first feather in this wing is this: God loved us with a   special saving love.       Ephesians 5:1, "Be imitators of God, as beloved children." And   verse 2: "Walk in love, just as Christ also loved you."       The first feather in the wing of gospel-flying -- gospel   forgiving -- is the unspeakable reality of being loved by God. But   to feel the force of this you need to know that this is not merely   the general love that God has for all the world -- the love that   gives life and breath and food and rain and protection and family   and job and many evidences of his truth and power and greatness.   It is an amazing thing to be loved like that, and should cause us   to turn to him in gratitude.       But if that is all you know of the love of God your gospel   wings will be weak. This text speaks of love like a Father has for   a child and love that moves Christ to take our place in death. Now   that is something more than the general love of God for the world.   That is a saving love -- a love that goes beyond the offer of the   gospel and actually undertakes to save us effectively, infallibly.   It does what needs to be done to get us forgiven and saved.       Here is the evidence for this: in Ephesians 1:4-5 Paul says   that this love of God chose us for adoption as children of God.        &#91;God&#93; chose us in&#91;Christ&#93; before the      foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless      before Him. In love 5 he predestined us to adoption assons.         So God has loved you with a love that is precious beyond words   because it is a love that he gave you before you were born and   that moved him to predestine you to be a child of God in holiness.       So the first feather in the wing of gospel forgiving is the   feather of God's special saving love -- call it covenant love. It   is not mere general love. It is love that fixed personally,   particularly on you as an individual and chose you and pursued you   and brought you to himself, because he means to have you. If you   get gripped by being loved like that, you might only need one   feather to fly.       2. The second feather is that Christ gave himself for you as a   sacrifice.       Ephesians 5:2b, "&#91;Christ&#93; gave Himself up for us, an   offering and a sacrifice to God."       According to Ephesians 2:3 we were all by nature children of   wrath. We all deserve to perish and be punished in hell for the   sins of our thoughts and imaginations and attitudes and tongues   and hands hand whole bodies. But the covenant love of God for us   moved him not only to choose us but to give his Son as a sacrifice   in our place: "Christ gave himself up for us" -- that is, in our   place, so that we don't have to perish. "He became a curse for us"   (Galatians 3:13).       To feel the full force of this and to make the feather really   strong for flying we need to realize again that this is not merely   a general thing Christ did the same for everybody. Ephesians 5:25   says, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and   gave himself up for her." In other words Christ's giving himself   up to die as a substitute for the church is part of a covenant   love that he has for his bride.       In love he chose you to be his bride and in love he lays down   his life for you. You, individually, particularly, were in view as   the goal of his loving and his dying.       Chuck Colson told the story (at the 1994 Ligonier Conference in   Dallas, Texas) of a prison camp where 20 men came in from digging   and lined their shovels up on the wall as they always did for the   counting. When they were counted, the officer found only 19. He   demanded that the one who didn't bring his shovel to step forward.   None did. Then he threatened that if no one stepped forward he   would choose ten men at random and shoot them. A young man of   about 19 stepped forward and was immediately taken a few paces a   way and shot as an example to the others.       But then as they were dismissing, the shovels were counted   again and there were twenty after all. The officer had miscounted.       The difference between what that boy did for his friends and   what Jesus did for you is that Jesus knew which ten men he was   dying for and he knew that we were all unworthy. But he did it   anyway, because he had a very special covenant love for you that   is far above human love.       The first feather is that you have been loved with a special   saving love. And the second feather is that Christ gave himself as   a sacrifice to take your place so that you will never perish.       3. The third feather for gospel-flying (forgiving) is that God   was satisfied with Christ's sacrifice.       Ephesians 5:2b, "&#91;Christ&#93; gave Himself up for us, an   offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."       When Paul calls the death of Jesus for us a "fragrant aroma" to   God he means that God satisfied with what Christ did. He did not   look down and say, "You can't do that. You can't die for others.   Every person has to bear their own guilt. Don't be so foolish to   think you can take the curse and condemnation of another." On the   contrary the Father looked down and (with tears in his eyes, I   think) took tremendous pleasure in the honor that the Son gave to   the Father in obeying his commission -- the Father had sent him   (John 3:16).       So Christ did not die in vain. God received his offering. It   satisfied the Father's justice. It removed God's wrath and   judgment.       Be ye glad, O be ye glad!    Every debt that you ever had,    Has been paid up in full by the blood of the Lamb,    Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad.       (Words and Music by Michael Kelly Blanchard    1980 Paragon Music Corp. (ASCAP)/Gotz Music (ASCAP) ICS. ARR. UBP.   Of The Benson Company, Inc., Nashville, TN.       God was satisfied with the blood of Christ. That's the third   feather in the first wing of gospel-flying and forgiveness.       That's the wing of God's work before you were born:       a. God loved you with special saving love;    b. Christ gave himself for you as a sacrifice; and    c. God was satisfied with Christ's sacrifice. Your debt is paid.       B. Wing #2: What God did for us during our lifetime       The other wing for gospel-flying has three feathers in it also.       1. God put you into a saving relationship with Christ, so that   you are united to Christ like a vine is united to the branch.       Ephesians 4:32b, "Forgive each other, just as God in Christ   also has forgiven you."       We are "in Christ". That means we are in a relationship with   Christ -- we are united to Christ -- in a way that makes us   acceptable to God because he is acceptable to God. How did we get   into this relationship? 1 Corinthians 1:30 says, "By   &#91;God's&#93; doing you are in Christ Jesus." God awakened faith   in our hearts and put us into a saving relationship with Jesus   (cf. Eph. 2:10,13; Rom. 16:17)       If he hadn't done that, all his other work (loving us, giving   his Son to die for us, being satisfied with the Son's sacrifice)   would have been in vain. But he did it. He is doing it all. His   love will not be frustrated in pursuing you for himself. His   personal, individual, particular, love is moving him all the way.   Nothing will stop him from saving you.       So the first feather in wing #2 for gospel-flying is God's   putting you into a relationship with Christ like a vine in a   branch.       2. The second feather for gospel-forgiving is that god adopted   you into his family and made you a rightful child of God.       Ephesians 5:1, Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved   children."       In other words realize that when God united you to Christ, you   became with Christ a child of God. And heir. This is what God had   been aiming at all along. Ephesians 1:5 says that "God predestined   us unto adoption."       Some parents have children accidentally. And if they are cruel   and heartless parents, they might even tell their children they   didn't want them. But God has no unwanted children. They are all   planned -- from eternity, with great expectation and joy. They are   all pursued. Christ's death is like an unspeakably high payment   through heaven's Micah Fund. 1        The second wing of gospel-flying in wing #2 is the truth that   you are loved not just in some random, general, impersonal way,   but as a child of God that he sought out and adopted at great   cost.       3. Finally the third feather in wing #2 for gospel-flying   (forgiving) is that God forgave you for your sins.       Ephesians 4:32, "And be kind to one another, tender-hearted,   forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven   you."       Review       Before you were born (wing #1):       1. God has loved you with a special, personal, saving love from   all eternity.    2. His son gave his life for you to take the place of your   judgment.    3. God was satisfied by the substitute and sacrifice of the Son.   The debt was paid.       Then after you were born (wing #2):       4. God brought you to faith and put you in a saving   relationship with Christ.    5. God adopted you into his family as a child of his own.    6. And God forgave all your sins and there is no condemnation.       These are the wings John Bunyan had in mind:       Run, John, run, the law commands    But gives us neither feet nor hands,    Far better news the gospel brings:    It bids us fly and gives us wings.       It bids us forgive -- and give us gospel wings. If you believe   in your heart that God has done all of this for you and in you,   you will fly. You will forgive.        Charles Spurgeon tells how his heart wasset on wing      by the pardon of God:             My life was full of sorrow and wretchedness, believing that      I was lost. But, oh, the blessed gospel of the God of grace      came to me, and with it a sovereign word, "Deliver him!" And I      who was but a minute before as wretched as a soul could be,      could have danced for the very merriment of heart. And as the      snow fell on my road home from the little house of prayer, I      thought every snowflake talked with me and told of the pardon I      had found, for I was white as the driven snow through the grace      of God. 2          But years later he added this:       To be forgiven is such sweetness that honey is tasteless in   comparison with it. But yet there is one thing sweeter still, and   that is to forgive. As it is more blessed to give than to receive,   so to forgive rises a stage higher in experience than to be   forgiven. 3        It rises higher because it is gospel-flying. Spread your wings   with me in these days at Bethlehem and let's fly together.         1  The Micah Fund is an adoption ministry at Bethlehem   that helps covers the cost of adopting Minority Infants who might   otherwise have been sacrificed in abortion.        2  Volume 15, p. 156, Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit.        3  Volume 31, pp. 287f., Metropolitan Tabernacle   Pulpit       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
