  June 12, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       THE COUNSEL OF THE LORD STANDS FOREVER    Reflections on Corporate Planning        The Lord nullifies the counsel of the nations; He frustrates   the plans of the peoples. The counsel of the Lord stands forever,   the plans of His heart from generation to generation.       In recent weeks the elders of our church and the financial and   property administrators have had some of the most penetrating and   far-reaching discussions I can remember. On the surface they have   dealt with crucial planning questions that we need to answer at   this point in the life of our church, which I will mention at the   end.       But at a deeper level the discussions have to do with God and   the whole concept of corporate planning. And that has set me   thinking a lot about being God-centered in rational, efficient,   management-run, corporate America -- which for millions today   includes the church (large churches in particular). I want to talk   about this bigger issue this morning, and try to bring a Biblical   word to bear on God and planning, especially corporate planning in   the life of the church. Then I want to mention what this means for   the process that the elders are initiating this summer.       The Counsel of the Lord Stands Forever       Let's put the two key verses from this Psalm in front of us.   Notice the words "counsel" and "plans". Psalm 33:10-11,        10 The Lord nullifies the counsel of thenations;       


He frustrates the plans of the peoples.       11 The counsel of the Lord stands forever,       


the plans of His heart from generation to      generation.         The point of these verses is that both men and God take counsel   and both plan. But in the end it is not the counsel and plans of   men that are established, but of God's. It is all important to   realize that God plans the world and he plans churches and what he   plans lives -- and his plans succeed. His plans take precedence   over our plans. Our plans have significance and durability to the   degree that God plans for our plans to be significant and durable.   God is the all important reality in planning from beginning to   end. God's will is for that to be known, to be explicit, to be   admired and enjoyed.       Then add verses 16-18:        16 The king is not saved by a mightyarmy;       


A warrior is not delivered by great      strength.       17 A horse is a false hope for victory;       


Nor does it deliver anyone by its great      strength.       18 Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him,       


On those who hope for Hislovingkindness,         Here we move beyond planning to implementation and resources,   but the point is the same. No matter how great our resources,   victory belongs to the Lord. A king may have a mighty army and   strong warriors; his horses may have great strength. But on the   day of battle God alone decides who wins. And God can make the   stronger or the weaker win -- whichever his plan determines. He   has a thousand ways of making the weaker triumph over the   stronger, and getting glory for his own name       For example, in the Shakespearean play Henry the Fifth (which   was also a movie a few years ago) King Henry comes against   incredible odds on the battlefield. In one scene of the movie you   see hundreds of bowmen in the back lines sending a downpour of   arrows arching over their own front lines and landing on the   advancing enemy. What you realize is that these arrows are   launched with no particular target in mind. They are sent with a   string and a prayer. In that situation who decides if the arrow   lands harmlessly in the ground or lands in the throat of an enemy   soldier? The slightest wind will change the course of a thousand   arrows. And one inch right or left may make the difference between   no wound or lethal wound. The answer: God decides.       That's why in the movie King Henry's victorious little army   sang Non nobis domine, gloria, as they walked through the bloody   field. "Not to us, O Lord, be the glory" -- a quote from Psalm   115:1.       That's the point of this Psalm. We may plan, but God's plans   hold sway. We may amass resources and strength, but the eye of the   Lord is on those who fear him. He decides what plans and resources   succeed. God is the central issue in corporate planning.       That's the main point this morning. And that's what our elders   and FPA's (Financial and Property Administrators) have been   wrestling with -- what are the implications of God's centrality in   Bethlehem's planning process as we try to answer key questions   about our future.       Corporate Planning in the Church: Dangerous Trend or Learning   from the Book of Providence?       Let me illustrate the way we posed the question. In a recent   issue of Christianity Today a church management event was   advertised that is typical of the kind of counsel that many church   consultants and management specialists and growth experts would   give. Here is the quote:       &#91;They&#93; will assist you and your leadership team in   understanding the purpose of your church, identifying your core   values, implementing a strategy to accomplish your vision, and   measuring the effectiveness of your ministry. You will learn how   to develop a shared vision embraced by your entire congregation   and understand how to coordinate your resources to fulfill that   vision for your church.       What you have in that paragraph are six steps of corporate   planning that are almost universal it seems among consultants   whose aim is to help institutions succeed. I mention them:       1. Understand your purpose.    2. Identify your values.    3. Determine your strategy.    4. Measure you effectiveness.    5. Get the people to share the vision.    6. Coordinate your resources to fulfil the vision.       The elders weren't dealing directly with this ad from CT, but   with the concept of planning behind it. Some of the questions that   the elders posed were these: Is it a harmless thing that this   approach to planning may not mention God or Christ or the Bible?   (The ad in CT did not.) Is it a harmless thing that this same   prescription for success is used in secular corporations? Is it a   harmless thing that this process of planning "works" whether your   corporate entity is a clothing store or a financial services   institution or a hospital or a Jehovah's Witnesses meeting hall or   a Mormon congregation or a Baptist Church? Follow these six steps   with aggressive leadership and you will succeed.       What does it say about the place of God among us if the key   that unlocks our future is the same key that unlocks the future of   institutions that don't share our God-centered values? Is there a   connection between how inconsequentially the reality of God rests   on so many churches (even "successful" ones) and the fact that   they may have set the entire tone of their ministry by adopting a   management process where God was totally unmentioned? In other   words can you make a God-omitting management strategy your   starting point and expect that you will end up with a radically   God-pervading ministry?       But what if the reason these six steps of planning work for all   kinds of institutions is that the sharp management observers in   the world have simply read them out of the book of God's   providence -- out of human behavior? That is, what if they work   because they reflect the way God has wired the human family to   work by natural laws? If that's the case, can't we just take them   over and fill them up with our specific God-centered content and   get on with growth? Those are the kinds of things we've been   wrestling with.       Let me give my reasons why I think we should not do that, and   then suggest constructively what I think we can do in order to be   true to the centrality of God in all our corporate planning and   then invite you into the process..       First, of all I think it is true that most of what works in the   world in science and industry is because sharp (God-given) minds   see the handiwork of God in the world, and read the book of   providence well enough to make efficient inventions and devices   and machines and procedures and processes and strategies. But   Christians desperately need to realize that for the most part this   is a secularized reading of God's providence, which has blindness   to God at its core. We need to awaken to the remarkable fact that   even Christians today are so soaked with secularism that we   scarcely hesitate to endorse the way the world reads the book of   providence provided that it works -- does it kill the virus? Does   it increase speed and efficiency? Does it make the corporation   grow?       Precious few, it seems, pull up the reins of this galloping   horse of efficient secular technology and say, "But could it be   that those who are blind to God in reading the book of his   providence, might get something fatally wrong, even as they   produce 'success'? Could it be that the stripping away of God from   his works distorts the true meaning of the works themselves?" I   think the answer to these questions is yes.       Corporate Planning and Bethlehem       And so here are the steps I would like us to take as we   consider ideas for corporate planning that come to us disconnected   from God:       







Repentance       First, I think we should be humbled, perhaps even humiliated,   that we the church, "the pillar and bulwark of the truth" (1   Timothy 3:15) may have to be directed by the world toward an   aspect of God's truth which belongs to God and is readable not   only from the book of providence, but also, much more fully and   purely, out of his Word and the history of redemption. The fact   that we have the Bible is no guarantee that we see in it what we   ought to see. The fact that some things are written more clearly   in the Bible than in human nature is no guarantee that we   Christians may not have blind spots to them while shrewd observers   in the world make use of the unclear fragment of the truth written   in the book of providence. So the first step we take may be   humiliation and repentance for our dullness or blind spots.       







Test Ideas for   Biblical Soundness       But secondly, we will then test the ideas that the world   commends on the basis of God's special revelation, the Bible. We   will bring them into relation to God and see how distorted they   may have become in the process of being stripped of their direct   tie to God. We will not simply say, "All truth is God's truth,"   and let secular managers become our guides to success. We will say   also, "All truth without God is not the truth God meant it to be."   A truth stripped of God is not a whole truth and will not guide   the church well. If we make God-neglecting truth our starting   point, we will probably produce a God-neglecting ministry.       







Make God   Explicit       Finally, if the ideas we are testing prove to be rooted in God,   then we will recast them in ways that make God explicit and that   reveal their roots in the character and plan and work of God.       In this way we will make God the starting point of our   corporate planning and the one from whom through whom and for whom   the entire process exists (Rom. 11:36). He will not be taken for   granted or become a silent assumption.       So let me close now by telling you specifically some steps that   the elders have taken to put in place a process of master planning   that we hope will help us capture this defining moment in the life   of our church.       







Four Questions       At least four questions press for answers in this moment of our   church life. And I hope that to the degree that they are relevant   for you, you will join us in the process of planning.       1. Whom are we trying to help meet God in worship, and what   forms of worship and music will help us do this? This question   probably needs to be asked more widely about our whole ministry.       2. What staffing configuration will help us best fulfill our   Biblical purposes? For example, should there be a full or part   time music minister; and, Of what kind?       3. What, if any, site development will be necessary in this   decade in order to accomplish our Biblical purposes? For example,   how will we minister to the very large bulge of young children on   their way to being teenagers? Or: will we have sufficient parking   to grow to the levels anticipated in 2000 by 2000, and provide a   base for the sending anticipated?       4. How quickly can we pay off our present mortgage on this   building and free up that money for other things? We raised half   the money up front, but now there remains $1.4 million to pay. And   what fund raising process would best reflect our Biblical values?   What, if any, new fund raising will be necessary?       







Five   initiatives       To answer these questions the elders (with the support of the   FPA's) have decided upon several initiatives:       1. We will enter on an intensive period (perhaps 12 months) of   Master Planning that we pray will have the fingerprints of God all   over it.       2. We will engage Doug Anderson and Nehemiah Ministries to   assist us in this effort. Doug's ministry has helped us repeatedly   in past planning efforts. We are excited about his commitment to   see Bethlehem thrive in the power of the Holy Spirit.       3. We would like to call Russ Gregg to relinquish his duties as   district elder for 12 months and instead to become Coordinator for   Master Planning. We will ask the church to approve this action at   the July quarterly strategy meeting since the extraordinary nature   of the position seems to warrant a small stipend (which can be   covered within the present budget).       4. We will assemble a Commission on Master Planning of perhaps   20 members of Bethlehem whom God is preparing for an extraordinary   investment of time and creative energy from September, 1994   through May, 1995. This group will give itself to prayer and study   and listening and reflection in order to assist the elders in   making recommendations to the church.       5. We will establish various listening posts and other means of   information gathering from the members of the church so that our   grasp of God's guidance will benefit from the gifts and insight   and wisdom of the wider of body.       You will have opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions   about this process at the July 20 meeting or sooner with any   elder. I am personally excited with this chance to hear God speak   to the church afresh about our mission for the rest of the decade.   It is a great comfort and joy to me to say over all our efforts:        10 The Lord nullifies the counsel of thenations;       


He frustrates the plans of the peoples.       11 The counsel of the Lord stands forever,       


the plans of His heart from generation to      generation.         Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
