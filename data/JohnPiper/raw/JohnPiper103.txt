 Evening Meditation on Hebrews 4:16 Bethlehem Baptist Church August 25, 1985 John Piper, Pastor    A WELL-TIMED HELP   Hebrews 4:14-16 SINCE THEN WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHO HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEAVENS, JESUS, THE SON OF GOD, LET US HOLD FAST OUR CONFESSION.  FOR WE HAVE NOT A HIGH PRIEST WHO IS UNABLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH OUR WEAKNESSES, BUT ONE WHO IN EVERY RESPECT HAS BEEN TEMPTED AS WE ARE, YET WITHOUT SINNING.  LET US THEN WITH CONFIDENCE DRAW NEAR TO THE THRONE OF GRACE, THAT WE MAY RECEIVE MERCY AND FIND GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED.  Notes:   Literally: grace for a well timed help.  The THRONE of GRACE implies:  1) help (because grace helps) and  2) well-timed (because one on a universal throne has the power and authority to bring help in the perfect time -- no flat tires!  DOCTRINE:  God's help is always well-timed.  For this to be true God must be the one who sets the times and rules the seasons of our lives and all the times of the world that may affect us.  Does he?   1.  God fixes all times by his own authority.  Acts 1:8  IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO KNOW TIMES OR SEASONS WHICH THE FATHER HAS FIXED BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY.   2.  God's perspective on time is vastly different than ours.  Psalm 90:4  FOR A THOUSAND YEARS IN THY SIGHT ARE BUT AS YESTERDAY WHEN IT IS PAST, OR AS A WATCH IN THE NIGHT.  2 Peter 3:8  BUT DO NOT IGNORE THIS ONE FACT, BELOVED, THAT WITH THE LORD ONE DAY IS AS A THOUSAND YEARS, AND A THOUSAND YEARS AS ONE DAY.   3.  God's timing will usually appear strange to us.  Acts 1:8  IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO KNOW TIMES OR SEASONS WHICH THE FATHER HAS FIXED BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY.   4.  God sets the times for nations to rise and fall.  Acts 17:26  AND HE MADE FROM ONE EVERY NATION OF MEN TO LIVE ON ALL THE FACE OF THE EARTH, HAVING DETERMINED ALLOTTED PERIODS AND THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR HABITATION...   5.  God sets the times of evil powers.  Matthew 8:29-29  AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE OTHER SIDE, TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GADARENES, TWO DEMONIACS MET HIM, COMING OUT OF THE TOMBS, SO FIERCE THAT NO ONE COULD PASS THAT WAY.  AND BEHOLD, THEY CRIED OUT, WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH US, O SON OF GOD?  HAVE YOU COME HERE TO TORMENT US BEFORE THE TIME?  Luke 22:52-53  THEN JESUS SAID TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND CAPTAINS OF THE TEMPLE AND ELDERS, WHO HAD COME OUT AGAINST HIM, HAVE YOU COME OUT AS AGAINST A ROBBER, WITH SWORDS AND CLUBS?  WHEN I WAS WITH YOU DAY AFTER DAY IN THE TEMPLE, YOU DID NOT LAY HANDS ON ME.  BUT THIS IS YOUR HOUR, AND THE POWER OF DARKNESS.  2 Thessalonians 2:3-6  LET NO ONE DECEIVE YOU IN ANY WAY; FOR THAT DAY [THE DAY OF THE LORD] WILL NOT COME, UNLESS THE REBELLION COMES FIRST, AND THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS IS REVEALED, THE SON OF PERDITION, WHO OPPOSES AND EXALTS HIMSELF AGAINST EVERY SO-CALLED GOD OR OBJECT OF WORSHIP, SO THAT HE TAKES HIS SEAT IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD, PROCLAIMING HIMSELF TO BE GOD.  DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT WHEN I WAS STILL WITH YOU I TOLD YOU THIS:  AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS RESTRAINING HIM NOW SO THAT HE MAY BE REVEALED IN HIS TIME.   6.  God sets the time for all the redemptive events of  history.  INCARNATION  Galations 4:4  BUT WHEN THE TIME HAD FULLY COME, GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON, BORN OF WOMAN, BORN UNDER THE LAW, TO REDEEM THOSE WHO WERE UNDER THE LAW, SO THAT WE MIGHT RECEIVE ADOPTION AS SONS.  CRUCIFIXION  Romans 5:6  WHILE WE WERE YET HELPLESS AT THE RIGHT TIME CHRIST DIED FOR THE UNGODLY  TESTIMONY TO THE WORK OF CHRIST  1 Timothy 2:5-6  FOR THERE IS ONE GOD, AND THERE IS ONE MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND MEN, THE MAN CHRIST JESUS, WHO GAVE HIMSELF AS A RANSOM FOR ALL, THE TESTIMONY TO WHICH WAS BORNE AT THE PROPER TIME.  THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST  1 Timothy 6:14-15  I CHARGE YOU TO DEEP THE COMMANDMENT UNSTAINED AND FREE FROM REPROACH UNTIL THE APPEARING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST; AND THIS WILL BE MADE MANIFEST AT THE PROPER TIME BY THE BLESSED AND ONLY SOVEREIGN, THE KINGS OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.  (See also Acts 7:17; Mark 1:15; Isaiah 60:22)   7.  God sets the times for success in missions.  Romans 11:25  LEST YOU BE WISE IN YOUR OWN CONCEITS, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS MYSTERY, BRETHREN: A HARDENING HAS COME UPON PART OF ISRAEL, UNTIL THE FULL NUMBER OF THE GENTILES COME IN.   8.  My personal times are in God's hands.  Psalm 31:15  MY TIMES ARE IN THY HAND; DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF MY ENEMIES AND PERSECUTORS!  James 13:15  COME NOW, YOU WHO SAY, TODAY OR TOMORROW WE WILL GO INTO SUCH AND SUCH A TOWN AND SPEND A YEAR THERE AND TRADE AND GET GAIN; WHERE AS YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW.  WHAT IS YOUR LIFE?  FOR YOU ARE A MIST THAT APPEARS FOR A LITTLE TIME AND THEN VANISHES.  INSTEAD YOU OUGHT TO SAY, IF THE LORD WILLS WE WILL LIVE AND WE SHALL DO THIS OR THAT.  1 Peter 5:6  humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god, that in due time he may exalt you. (See Galatians 6:9)   9.  Therefore pray with the confidence that you will find grace for a WELL-TIMED HELP.   Piper's Notes
