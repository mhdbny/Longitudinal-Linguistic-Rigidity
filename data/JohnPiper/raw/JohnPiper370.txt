 January 17, 1993    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       BEING PRO-LIFE CHRISTIANS    UNDER A PRO-CHOICE PRESIDENT    (1 Peter 2:13-17)        Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every      human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,      or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers      and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of      God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of      foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a      covering for evil, but use it as bond-slaves of God. Honor all      men; love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.         In A.D. 37 a boy was born in Italy named Lucius Domitius   Ahenobarbus. His mother's name was Agrippina the Younger. She   married the Roman Emperor Claudius who adopted her little boy and   changed his name to Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus. The adoption   and the name change were all part of his mother's plotting to see   him, instead of Claudius' biological son Britannicus, become   emperor of Rome.       In A.D. 54 when Nero was 17 years old his mother arranged for   Claudius to be poisoned to death, and the boy was proclaimed   emperor of Rome. His reign would last 14 years, until he committed   suicide at age 31.       In the first half of his reign there was relatively good   government because as a youth he received good counsel from   Burrus, the head of the Praetorian Guard, and from Seneca the   famous stoic philosopher.       Nero was selfish and calculating and incapable of ruling well   on his own. He became paranoid of all the rumors about plots to   kill him. In 55 he had his step brother Britannicus killed. In 59   he had his mother executed. And in 62 his first wife was executed.   And Seneca his former counsellor was forced to commit suicide.       The apostle Peter probably arrived in Rome some time around   A.D. 63. The city had already become known as "Babylon"--the code   word among Christians for the great urban embodiment of   anti-Christian power and evil (cf. Rev. 16:19; 17:5; 18:2),   because the ancient Eastern Babylon had been the place where the   people of God were taken captive far from their true home. So   Peter is in Rome when he writes his first letter: "She &#91;the   church&#93; who is at Babylon sends you greetings" (1 Peter 5:13).       In the night of July 19, 64 a fire broke out in the southern   part of the city. It raged for six days, spreading far and wide.   When it was about to die out, it suddenly broke out again in the   northern part of the city and burned three more days. Ten of the   14 wards of the city were destroyed. The frenzy in the city was   indescribable.       Rumors began to spread that Nero himself had started the fire   because of his delirious craving for magnificence and desire to   embellish and rebuild the city. To divert attention from himself,   the historian Tacitus says, Nero blamed the Christians for the   fire, who were hated anyway, and so were good scapegoats.       The effect was horrendous. There had been no persecution like   it since the Lord had risen thirty years before. In the gardens of   Nero the Christians were crucified, sewn into wild beast skins and   fed to dogs, drenched in flammable oil and lifted on poles to burn   as torches in the night.       Eusebius tells us that Peter was crucified "because he had   demanded to suffer" (E.H. 3.1.2-3).       Peter's letter was probably written some time shortly before   this terrible persecution. Christians were being slandered and   mistreated (2:12,15) as he wrote, but this was typical all over   the empire he says in 5:9. The the great persecution was not there   yet. But it seems that Peter could see it on the horizon with   prophetic accuracy. For example, he said in 4:12, "Beloved, do not   be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you   for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to   you."       Nero was not the only ruler Peter had known. He had known of   Pilate, the governor in Judea, who washed his hands of Jesus'   murder, had him beaten and turned him over to be crucified with no   grounds. He had known of Herod Antipas who executed John the   Baptist as a dancing prize and later put his purple robe on Jesus   and mocked him with his soldiers. Peter was probably a boy in   Galilee when he heard that Herod the Great had killed all the   children in Bethlehem.       So Peter was not naive about the vicious world of government   corruption and wickedness. He did not live in a "Christian   nation." He knew the depravity of human nature and the utterly   ruinous corruption that political power can bring. This was the   world into which he wrote our text. Verse 13:       Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human   institution whether to a king as the one in authority, or to   governors as sent by him       And verse 17: "Honor all men; love the brotherhood, fear God,   honor the king."       The point of drawing attention to Nero and Pilate and Herod is   not to say that there is a Nero or Pilate or Herod in power today   in America. The point is to say that if Peter could command the   Christian community to honor the king and the governor, knowing   the wickedness of Nero and Pilate and Herod, then how much more   must we honor the governor and the president who are not in that   category--even though they may endorse and promote acts which we   regard as immoral and even barbaric.       My question today is: How can I as a pro-life Christian honor   President-elect Bill Clinton when he supports the right to kill   unborn children for any reason up through the age of viability   (24-23-22 weeks and falling), and for emotional health reasons   even after that. We know this because he has expressed his support   for the Freedom of Choice Act which is before Congress and would   give federal sanction to just those "rights" and would take from   the states the right to make many laws protecting the unborn that   are now being proposed.       This message does not aim to be political. But I realize that   being a Christian today is increasingly putting us at odds with   political positions. Just being an obedient Christian is   increasingly becoming a social, political, legal issue. The aim of   this message is to answer the Biblical-theological-ethical   question: How shall we obey God's command in 1 Peter 2:17 to honor   the king--or the president, or the governor--when they promote   dishonorable deeds?       What our future president endorses is not the right to scrape a   few fetal cells off the lining of the uterus, but that human   beings who have a beating heart, give an EKG reading, show brain   waves, grasp with their fingers, suck their thumbs, respond with   pain, and carry all the genetic completeness of a human--that   those humans may rightfully have their life ended by   dismemberment.       And what I just described is the human fetus at eight weeks   before which scarcely any abortions are done. To make the true   position of the president-elect clear we need to see that not only   that little one will receive no protection from him but neither   will this 12 week old, nor this five month old (show both models).       If you are sitting there this morning and thinking that the   presidential endorsement of the right to take the lives of babies   like this is an honorable thing to do (either because you don't   think they are babies or you think it's the lesser of two evils),   then your struggle is going to be different from mine. I struggle   with the command, "How shall I honor a president who endorses the   right to kill the unborn?" You must struggle with the command in   the same verse, "How shall I honor people like this pastor who   preaches what is false?" For the text not only says, "Honor the   king," it says, "Honor all men." So it may be that in the answer I   suggest for my struggle there will be something of use for yours.       Here is my answer to the question, "How do pro-life Christians   honor a pro-choice president?"       1. We will honor you, Mr. President, by humbling ourselves   under the mighty hand of God (1 Peter 5:6) and acknowledging that   we are ourselves sinners and in need of mercy and forgiveness from   God. We are not infallible. We are open to new light on this and   every issue. We are not the final judge in this matter. God is. We   stand before the cross of Christ on level ground with you, not   above you, utterly dependent on mercy and seeking to live by the   will of Christ.       2. We will honor you by acknowledging that you are a man,   created in the image of God, and distinct among all the beings in   the world (as it says in James 3:9). You are not a mere animal.   You have the glorious potential, like all humans, of being a child   of God (if you aren't already) and shining like the sun in the   kingdom of God for ever and ever. We honor you as an utterly   unique, human being created in the image and likeness of the   living God with untold potential.       3. We will honor you by acknowledging that government is God's   institution. He wills that there be leaders like presidents and   governors. You are in power by God's appointment and we honor   that. In Romans 13:4 the Bible even calls you, "God's servant for   our good." It grieves us that you do not intend to enact laws to   protect the good of the unborn the most innocent, weak, and   helpless group of Americans. But we have seen from Somalia that   bad government is better than no government. The absence of some   laws to protect some people is better than the absence of all laws   to protect anybody. We honor your stabilizing role in this sense   as a blessing from God.       4. We will honor you by submitting to the laws of the state and   the nation wherever they do not conflict with our higher   allegiance to Christ the King of kings and Lord of lords. We will   submit to the laws that take away              our "right" to chose to go 75 miles an hour,              our "right" to choose keep our lights off when our      windshield wipers are on,              our "right" to choose to drive without a seat belt,              our "right" to choose to fish without a license,              our "right" to choose to make loud noises in the middle of      the night,              our "right" to choose to keep our kids out of      schooling,              our "right" to choose to send them to school without DPT      shots,              our "right" to choose to use leaded gas,              our "right" to choose not to pay taxes,              our "right" to choose to smoke on the other side of the      restaurant, etc.            We submit to the right of government to limit our right to   choose in hundreds of areas, especially when the good of others is   at stake. We understand that governments exist to limit the right   to choose and we submit to that.       1 Peter 2:13 says that we are to submit not for your sake but   for the Lord's sake. Verse 16 says that we are free in respect to   you but slaves of God. We will submit not because you have power,   but because our King commands it for the honor of His institution   of civil government. Yet our submission is an honor to you because   under God and from God you bear the authority to enforce the laws   of the land.       5. We will honor you by not withdrawing into little communes of   disengaged isolation from American culture. But according to 1   Peter 2:15, we will honor you by trying to do as much good as we   possibly can for the unborn, and for unwanted children, and for   women in distress, so that we will not be thought insolent or   inconsistent in asking from you what we are not willing to do   ourselves. We do this because the Bible says, "It is the will of   God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish   men" (1 Peter 2:15).       6. We will honor you by opposing your position as long as we   can with non-violence instead of violence, with reasoning instead   of rocks, with rational passion instead of screaming, with   honorable speech instead of obscenities, with forthright clarity   of language instead of dodging the tough realities and tough   words, with evidence instead of authority, and with scientific   portrayals of life instead of authoritarian blackouts (cf. 2 Cor.   4:2). We will honor you by a relentless effort to put truth, and   not mere emotion, before you in the White House.       7. And we will honor you by expecting from you straightforward   answers to straightforward questions. We would not expect this   from a con-man or a chimp. We expect it from an honorable man.       For example, are you willing to explain why a baby's right not   to be killed is less important than a woman's right not to be   pregnant?       Or are you willing to explain why most cities have laws   forbidding cruelty to animals, but you oppose laws forbidding   cruelty to human fetuses? Are they not at least living animals?       Or are you willing to explain why government is unwilling to   take away the so-called right to abortion on demand even though it   harms the unborn child; yet government is increasingly willing to   take away the right to smoke, precisely because it harms innocent   non-smokers, killing 3,000 non-smokers a year from cancer and as   many as 40,000 non-smokers a year from other diseases?       And if you say that everything hangs on whether the fetus is a   human child, are you willing to go before national television in   the oval office and defend your support for the "Freedom of Choice   Act" by holding in your hand a 21 week old fetus and explaining   why this little one does not have the fundamental, moral and   constitutional right to life? Are you willing to say to parents in   this church who lost a child at that age and held him in their   hands, this being in your hands is not and was not a child with   any rights of its own under God or under law?       Perhaps you have good answers to each of these questions. We   will honor you by expecting you to defend your position   forthrightly in the public eye. You have immense power as   President of the United States. To wield it against the protection   of the unborn without giving a public accounting in view of moral   and scientific reality would be dishonorable. We will honor you by   expecting better.       8. Finally we will honor you by trusting that the purpose of   our sovereign and loving God to defend the fatherless and contend   for the defenseless and to exalt the meek will triumph through   your presidency. And to that end we will pray for you as Christ   our King commands us.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
