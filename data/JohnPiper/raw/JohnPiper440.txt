    May 7, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Love your neighbor as you love yourself (Part 2).   (Matthew 22:34-40)          

    But when thePharisees heard that He had put    the Sadducees to silence, they gathered themselves together. Andone of them, a lawyer,    asked Him a question, testing Him, Teacher, which is thegreatest commandment in the    Law?      


 And He said to him, 'You shall love theLord your God with all    your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.'This is the great and    foremost commandment. The second is like it, &#145;You shalllove your neighbor as    yourself.&#146; On these two commandments depend the whole Lawand the Prophets.              A Very Radical Command     Love your neighbor as yourself,is a very radical  command. What I mean by radical is this: it cuts tothe  root  of our  sinfulness and exposes it and, by God&#146;s grace, severs it. Theroot of our sinfulness  is the desire for our own happiness  apart from God  and apart from the happiness  of others in God . Let me say it again: the root of oursinfulness is the desire to be  happy  apart from God  and  apart from the happiness ofothers in God . All sin  comes from a desire to be happy cut off from glory of God and cutoff from good of others.  The command of Jesus cuts to this root, exposes it and seversit.    Another name for this root of sinfulness is pride.  Pride is the  presumption that we can be happy without depending on God as thesource of our happiness  and without caring if others find their happiness in God. Pride isthe passion to be happy  contaminated and corrupted by two things: 1) the unwillingness tosee God as the only  fountain of true and lasting joy, and 2) the unwillingness to seeother people as designed  by God to receive our joy in him. If you take the desire to behappy and strip away from  it God as the fountain of your happiness, and people as therecipients of your happiness,  what you have left is the engine of pride. Pride is the pursuit ofhappiness anywhere but  in the glory of God and the good of other people. This is the rootof all sin.    Now Jesus says, Love your neighbor asyourself. And with  that commandment he cuts to the root of our sinfulness. How so?     Self-Love: A Creation of God     Jesus says in effect: I start with yourinborn, deep, defining  human trait -- your love for yourself. This is a given. Idon&#146;t command it; I assume  it. All of you have a powerful instinct of self-preservation andself-fulfillment. You all  want to be happy. You all want to live and to live withsatisfaction. You want food for  yourself. You want clothes for yourself. You want a place to livefor yourself. You want  protection from violence against yourself. You want meaningful orpleasant activity to  fill your days. You want some friends to like you and spend sometime with you. You want  your life to count in some way. All this is self-love. Self-loveis the deep longing to  diminish pain and to increase happiness. That&#146;s what Jesusstarts with when he says,  as yourself.    Everyone, without exception, has this humantrait. This is what moves  us to do this or that. Even suicide is pursued out of thisprinciple of self-love. In the  midst of a feeling of utter meaningless and hopelessness andnumbness of depression the  soul says: It can&#146;t get any worse than this. So even ifI don&#146;t know what  I will gain through death, I do know what I will escape. Andso suicide is an  attempt to escape the intolerable. It is an act of self-love.    Now Jesus says, I start with this self-love.This is what I know about  you. This is common to all people. You don&#146;t have to learnit. It comes with your  humanity. My Father created it. In and of itself it is good. Tohunger for food is not  evil. To want to be warm in the winter is not evil. To want to besafe in a crisis is not  evil. To want to be healthy during a plague is not evil. To wantto be liked by others is  not evil. To want your life to count in some significant way isnot evil. This was a  defining human trait before the fall of man into sin, and it isnot evil in itself.      Love Your Neighbor  AS  You LoveYourself     Whether it has become evil in your lifewill be exposed as you hear  and respond to Jesus&#146; commandment. He commands, As youlove yourself, so love  your neighbor. Which means: As you long for food when youare hungry, so long to  feed your neighbor when he is hungry. As you long for nice clothesfor yourself, so long  for nice clothes for your neighbor. As you work for a comfortableplace to live, so desire  a comfortable place to live for your neighbor. As you seek to besafe and secure from  calamity and violence, so seek comfort and security for yourneighbor. As you seek friends  for yourself, so be a friend to your neighbor. As you want yourlife to count and be  significant, so desire that same significance for your neighbor.As you work to make good  grades yourself, so work to help your neighbor make good grades.As you like to be  welcomed into strange company, so welcome your neighbor intostrange company. As you would  that men would do to you, do so to them.    In other words make your  self-seeking the measure of your  self-giving .  When Jesus says, Love your neighbor as yourself, theword as is  very radical: Love your neighbor   as  yourself. That&#146;s a BIG  word: As! It means: If you are  energetic  inpursing your own happiness,  be energetic in pursuing the happiness of your neighbor. If youare  creative  in  pursuing your own happiness, be creative in pursuing the happinessof your neighbor. If  you are  persevering  in pursuing your own happiness, bepersevering in pursuing the  happiness of your neighbor. In other words, Jesus is not justsaying: seek for your  neighbor the  same things  you seek for yourself, but alsoseek them in the  same  way  -- the same zeal and energy and creativity andperseverance. The same life and  death commitment when your are in danger. Make your own self-seeking the measure of your  self-giving. Measure your pursuit of the happiness of others, andwhat it should be, by  the pursuit of your own. How do you pursue your own well-being?Pursue your  neighbor&#146;s well-being that way too.    Now this is very threatening and almostoverwhelming. Because we feel  immediately that if we take Jesus seriously, we will not just haveto love others as  we love ourselves, but we will have to love them instead  of loving  ourselves. That&#146;s what it seems like. We fear that ifwe follow Jesus in this,  and really devote ourselves to pursuing the happiness of others,then our own desire for  happiness will always be preempted. The neighbor&#146;s claim onmy time and energy and  creativity will always take priority. So the command to love myneighbor as I love myself  really feels like a threat to my own self-love. How is this evenpossible? If there is  born in us a natural desire for our own happiness, and if this isnot in itself evil, but  good, how can we give it up and begin only to seek the happinessof others at the expense  of our own?     The Necessity of the First Commandment toFulfill the Second     I think that is exactly the threat thatJesus wants us to feel,  until we realize that this -- exactly this -- is why the firstcommandment is the first  commandment. It&#146;s the first commandment that makes the secondcommandment doable and  takes away the threat that the second commandment is really thesuicide of our own  happiness. The first commandment is, Love the Lord your Godwith all your heart and  with all your soul and with all your mind (v. 37). The firstcommandment is the  basis of the second commandment. The second commandment is avisible expression of the  first commandment. Which means this: Before you make your own self-seeking the measure of  your self-giving, make God the focus of your self-seeking. This isthe point of the first  commandment.     Love God with all your heart means:Find in God a  satisfaction so profound that it fills up all your heart.Love God with all your  soul means: Find in God a meaning so rich and so deep thatit fills up all the  aching corners of your soul. Love God with all yourmind means: Find in God  the riches of knowledge and insight and wisdom that guide andsatisfy all that the human  mind was meant to be.    In other words take all your self-love -- allyour longing for joy and  hope and love and security and fulfillment and significance --take all that, and focus it  on God, until he satisfies your heart and soul and mind. What youwill find is that this  is not a canceling out of self-love. This is a fulfillment andtransformation of  self-love. Self-love is the desire for life and satisfactionrather than frustration and  death. God says, Come to me, and I will give you fullness of joy.I will satisfy your  heart and soul and mind with my glory. This is the first and greatcommandment.    And with that great discovery -- that God isthe never-ending fountain  of our joy -- the way we love others is forever changed. Now whenJesus says, Love  your neighbor  as yourself , we don&#146;t respond bysaying, Oh, this is  threatening. This means my love for myself is made impossible byall the claims of my  neighbor. I could never do this. Instead we say, Oh,yes, I love myself. I  have longings for joy and satisfaction and fulfillment andsignificance and security. But  God has called me -- indeed he has commanded me -- to come to himfirst for all these  things. He commands that my love for him be the form of my lovefor me. That all my  longings for me I find in him. That is what my self-love is now.It is my love for God.  They have become one. My quest for happiness is now nothing otherthan a quest for God.  And he has been found in Jesus Christ.    So what then is Jesus commanding in the secondcommandment -- that we  love our neighbor as ourselves? He is commanding that our self-love, which has now  discovered its fulfillment in God-love, be the measure and thecontent of our  neighbor-love. Or, to put it another way, he is commanding thatour inborn self-seeking,  which has now been transposed into God-seeking, overflow andextend itself to our  neighbor. So, for example:          If you are longing to see more ofGod&#146;s bounty and liberality      through the supply of food and rent and clothing, then seek toshow others the greatness      of this divine bounty by the generosity you have found in him.Let the fulfillment of your      own self-love in God-love overflow into neighbor love. Orbetter: seek that God, who is      the fulfillment of your self-love overflow through yourneighbor-love and become the      fulfillment of your neighbor&#146;s self-love.            If you want to enjoy more of God&#146;scompassion through the      consolations he gives you in sorrow, then seek to show othersmore of God&#146;s      compassion through the consolations you extend to them insorrow.             If you long to savor more of God&#146;swisdom through the counsel he      gives in stressful relationships, then seek to extend more ofGod&#146;s wisdom to others      in their stressful relationships.            If you delight in seeing God&#146;sgoodness in relaxed times of      leisure, then extend that goodness to others by helping themhave relaxed, healthy times      of leisure.             If you want to see more of God&#146;ssaving grace powerfully      manifested in your life, then stretch out that grace into thelives of others who need      that saving grace.            If you want to enjoy more of the richesof God&#146;s personal      friendship through thick and thin, then extend that friendshipto the lonely through thick      and thin.            In all these ways neighbor-love does notthreaten self-love because  self-love has become God-love, and God-love is not threatened,diminished or exhausted by  being poured into the lives of others.    I don&#146;t mean that this answers all ourquestions about love, or  that it takes away every kind of threat in loving our neighbor.There are many  perplexities in the life of love. There are competing claims onour limited time. There  are hard choices about what to give up and what to keep. There aredifferent  interpretations of what is good for another person. I don&#146;tmean here that all of  that becomes simple.    What I do mean is this: loving God sustains usthrough all the joy and  pain and perplexity and uncertainty of what loving our neighborshould be. When the  sacrifice is great, we remember that his grace is sufficient. Whenthe fork in the road of  love is unmarked, we remember with joy and love that his grace issufficient. When we are  distracted by the world and our hearts give way temporarily toselfishness and we are off  the path, we remember that God alone can satisfy, and we repentand love his  all-sufficient grace the more.     Summary     It is a very radical command. It cuts tothe root of sin, called  pride. Remember, this root of pride that gives rise to all othersins, is the passion to  be happy (self-love) contaminated and corrupted by two things: 1)the unwillingness to see  God as the only fountain of true and lasting joy, and 2) theunwillingness to see other  people as designed by God to receive our joy in him. But that isexactly the contamination  and corruption of self-love that Jesus counteracts in these twocommandments. In the first  commandment he focuses the passion to be happy firmly on God andGod alone. In the second  commandment he opens a whole world of expanding joy in God andsays: people, human beings,  everywhere you find them, are designed to receive and enlarge yourjoy in God. Love them  the way you love yourself. Show them, give them -- through everypractical means available  -- what you have found for yourself in God.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
