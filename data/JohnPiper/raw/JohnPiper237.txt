        AT THE PRICE OF GOD'S OWN BLOOD    (Acts 20:28)        Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy   Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God which   He obtained with the blood of His own Son.        I have been moved deeply recently in reading about the life of   Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Many of you know about him. Some   don't .He was a German, born in 1700, who founded a community of   earnest Christians called Herrnhut ("The Lord's Watch") .The   community became part of the Moravian church and was best known   for its unparalleled missionary zeal.        In 1727 the community started a 'round the clock "prayer watch"   that lasted unbroken for 100 years. There were about 300 persons   in the community at the beginning, and various ones covenanted to   pray for one of the 24 hours in the day. In 1792, 65 years later,   with the lamp of prayer still burning, the little community had   sent out 300 missionaries to the unreached peoples of the West   Indies, Greenland, Lapland, Turkey, and North America. They were   utterly, and radically dedicated to making Jesus known.        I mention this not only because I dream of a church saturated   with prayer and sold out utterly to Christ and ready to leave   everything for His call. I mention it this morning because behind   this community at Herrnhut there was an experience of deep   humbling and cleansing and power based on the blood of Jesus.        After Zinzendorf had finished the University he took a trip   throughout Europe looking at some of the cultural highspots. And   something very unexpected happened. In the art museum at   Dusseldorf he saw a painting by Domenico Feti entitled Ecce Homo   ("Behold the Man") .It was a portrait of Christ with the crown of   thorns pressed down on His head and blood running down His   face.        Beneath the portrait were the words, "I have done this for you;   what have you done for me?" All of his life Zinzendorf looked back   to that encounter as utterly life-changing. As he stood there, as   it were, watching his Savior suffer and bleed, he said to himself,   "I have loved Him for a long time, but I have never actually done   anything for Him. From now on I will do whatever He leads me to   do."        For the rest of his life the blood of Jesus had a central place   in the doctrine and devotion of Zinzendorf and his community at   Herrnhut. And the story goes that when the first two young   missionaries boarded the ship in Copenhagen to sail for the West   Indies, perhaps never to return (20 out of the first 29   missionaries to St. Thomas and St. Croix died in those first   years), they lifted their hands as if in sacred pledge and called   out to their friends on shore, "May the Lamb that was slain   receive the reward of His suffering!"        My message is going to be short today because I want to save a   good portion of time to worship the Lord and to pray together   before we take the Lord's Supper. And the question I want you to   ask yourself and ask the Lord as you prepare for the Lord's Table   is this: "Has the Lord obtained the reward of his sufferings in   your life?" When you think about the blood of Jesus running down   His face from the thorns, and from His hands and feet and pouring   His side, are you content with what He has of you? Has the   purchase that He made been obtained freely from your hand. Or are   you withholding any of the reward of His suffering?        To help us answer that very personal question let me take a few   minutes and meditate with you on the blood of Christ. What did God   purchase at the price of His own blood?        Acts 20:28 says that He purchased the church. "Take heed to   yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made   you overseers, to care for the church of God which He obtained   with the blood of His own Son."        So when Zinzendorf stood before the painting in Dusseldorf as a   believing, faithful member of the church of Jesus Christ, he could   say on the authority of this text: "These wounds were meant to   purchase me. These drops of blood were shed to obtain me." He   could never get over it. He was not his own; he was bought with a   price. Do you get up in the morning and say, "I am not my own   today. I belong to another. I have been bought with a price. And I   will live every moment of this day so that the Great Purchaser of   my soul will receive the full reward of His suffering."        And what would that mean in daily practice? Let me mention   three things.        1. The reward of Christ's sufferings and the purchase of his   blood is the cleansing and beautifying of his people, his   bride.        Ephesians 5:25-27, "Husbands love your wives as Christ loved   the church and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify   her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,   that He might present the church to Himself in splendor, without   spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and   without blemish."        What then did He bleed to purchase? What was the reward of His   suffering? Verse&yuml;26: to sanctify His church. The holiness of   His people will be His reward. Verse 27: to present her to Himself   in splendor without spot or wrinkle. So His reward will be the   beauty of His bride &#151; she will be splendid and glorious at   the marriage feast of the Lamb.        So I ask you again before we take this sacred cup, are you   striving with all your might to render to Jesus the reward of His   suffering &#151; to offer up to Him what He has purchased? Or to   put it differently, Is your heart in tune with His heart? His   heart that considered your holiness something worth dying for? Are   you putting the same price on your holiness that He did? Or do you   neglect what He died to purchase?        First then, the reward of Christ's sufferings is the holiness   of His people. He suffered and bled and died to obtain a people   and to make that people holy &#151; to make His bride clean and   beautiful. Your holiness &#151; your spiritual beauty &#151; is   the reward of His sufferings and the purchase of His blood. And He   will have it from all those who are truly His.        2. secondly the reward of Christ's sufferings is the zeal of   his people for good deeds.        Titus 2:14 says, "He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all   iniquity and to purify for Himself a people of His own who are   zealous for good deeds."        He gave Himself to make a people zealous for good deeds. He   shed His blood to purchase your zeal for practical righteousness   and mercy, for benevolence and kindness, for courage and   compassion. Notice this carefully: He did not die merely to get   you to stop doing some bad things. Nor did He die merely to get   you to do some good things. He died to make you zealous for good   deeds. He suffered and bled and died to give you a zeal for doing   good.        Do you have a zeal for doing good to people? Eternal good   through their salvation? And temporal good as a means to that end?   Or are you denying Christ the reward of His sufferings? What does   it mean that Christ gave Himself in wracking pain to make you   zealous for good deeds, if you are taking no steps to become   zealous for good deeds?        The zeal of those early Moravian missionaries was unquenchable.   And I think the reason is that they never forgot the blood of   Jesus. They never stopped thinking: my life, my holiness, my zeal   for the good of souls was purchased at the price of His blood. How   can I not live for His honor with every breath I take! How can I   not freely offer up to Him what He has purchased with His   blood?        Your zeal for the good of people is the reward of His   suffering. Are you with Him or against Him in His suffering?        3. Finally, the reward of Christ's sufferings is a ransomed   church from every tribe and language and people and nation.        In Revelation 5:9 the Lamb of God is worshipped with these   words, "Worthy art Thou to take the scroll and to open its seals,   for Thou wast slain and by Thy blood didst ransom persons for God   from every tribe and tongue and people and nation."        By His blood He has ransomed persons from every people group in   the world &#151; every tribe, every language group, every culture,   every ethnic cluster. The reward of His suffering is the   ingathering of the elect from all the peoples of the world. In   other words, the blood of Jesus was shed not just to purchase your   holiness and your zeal for good deeds; but the holiness and the   good deeds of all the worldwide church of God including those   sheep that are not yet in the fold.        So I ask again: does your heart beat with His heart this   morning? Are you pursuing in your life the things He bled to   obtain? When we come to the Lord's table in a few moments and with   the cup and the bread proclaim His death, will you be able to say   to Him with a clear conscience, "There is nothing I want more in   my life than what you bled to obtain; there is no reward in my   life that I want more than the reward of your suffering"?        If you look at your life and come up wanting (as we all will)   do not forget this: the reward of His suffering is also the   forgiveness of sins (Ephesians 1:7) and justification by faith   (Romans 5:9), and reconciliation with God (Romans 5:10), and   cleansing of conscience (Hebrews 9:14) and final victory over   Satan (Revelation&yuml;12:11).        In the next few minutes let's do some real serious business   with God and with His Son. There is confession enough for all of   us. And some serious praying is needed about defects in our lives   that reveal a terrible indifference to the price Jesus paid for   our holiness and our zeal for good deeds and our passion for world   evangelization.        Don't let go of God in this hour until you can say from the   bottom of your heart, "Lord, Jesus, there is nothing I want more   in my life than what You bled to obtain."
