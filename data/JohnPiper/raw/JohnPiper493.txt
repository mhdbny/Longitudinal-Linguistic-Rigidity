  November 24, 1996 Bethlehem Baptist Church Thanksgiving Sunday John Piper, Pastor    Celebration of  Freeing the Future       From Thy Hand We Have GivenThee   (1 Chronicles 29:6-20)     A Sermon in Celebration of   Being Debt-Free as a Church      Then the rulers of the fathers'households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and thecommanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the overseers over theking's work, offered willingly; and for the service for the house ofGod they gave 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, and 10,000talents of silver, and 18,000 talents of brass, and 100,000 talentsof iron. And whoever possessed precious stones gave them to thetreasury of the house of the LORD, in care of Jehiel the Gershonite.Then the people rejoiced because they had offered so willingly, forthey made their offering to the LORD with a whole heart, and KingDavid also rejoiced greatly.    So David blessed the LORD inthe sight of all the assembly; and David said, "Blessed art Thou, OLORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever. Thine, O LORD, isthe greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and themajesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth;Thine is the dominion, O LORD, and Thou dost exalt Thyself as headover all. Both riches and honor come from Thee, and Thou dost ruleover all, and in Thy hand is power and might; and it lies in Thy handto make great, and to strengthen everyone. Now therefore, our God, wethank Thee, and praise Thy glorious name. But who am I and who are mypeople that we should be able to offer as generously as this? For allthings come from Thee, and from Thy hand we have given Thee. For weare sojourners before Thee, and tenants, as all our fathers were; ourdays on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope. O LORD ourGod, all this abundance that we have provided to build Thee a housefor Thy holy name, it is from Thy hand, and all is Thine. Since Iknow, O my God, that Thou triest the heart and delightest inuprightness, I, in the integrity of my heart, have willingly offeredall these things; so now with joy I have seen Thy people, who arepresent here, make their offerings willingly to Thee. O LORD, the Godof Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve this forever inthe intentions of the heart of Thy people, and direct their heart toThee; and give to my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Thycommandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to do them all,and to build the temple, for which I have made provision."    Then David said to all theassembly, "Now bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessedthe LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed low and did homage tothe LORD and to the king.     The Facts on theHuman Level    Verses 6-9 describe the factson the human level. There was an incredible generosity in Israel forthe collection to pay for the building of the temple in Jerusalem.David led the way and the fathers and princes and commanders andoverseers gave gold and silver and brass and iron. Everyone who hadprecious stones gave them to the Jehiel -- the Paul Johnson (ourfinancial secretary) of David's court. Those are the facts on thehuman level: there was enormous generosity. Money had come in. Therewas enough to build the temple. There was enough to eliminate alldebt.    Now the question is: How do youaccount for this? At one level, David is not the least afraid ofsaying that    people    did the giving. He stresses that theirwills were profoundly involved in the giving. Look at verse 9: "Thenthe people rejoiced because they had offered    so willingly   , for they made their offering to theLORD    with awhole     heart    ." They werenot coerced. They made choices. Human choices. This is what anyonewould see from the human level.    If the news media arrived andgave a report on what happened, they would say that the cause wasperceived by the people as exciting; they would say that David was acharismatic leader; they would say that the overseers and princes andcommanders set an inspiring example; they would say that Jehiel andthe financial officers had won the trust of the people; they mightsay that the economy was bullish that year; and that a new buildingin Jerusalem was a matter of pride. And then perhaps they would letthe cameras pan out over the soon-to-be temple site and close thereport with the best of their profundity: "This is where the templewill stand some day --     if     the amazing free will of the peoplekeeps generating this kind of commitment."    And thus the media would havecome and seen and reported -- and missed everything that ultimatelymatters.    The Reality Hidden tothe Physical Eye    What matters on this day is notwhat you see with the eye of the body. What matters is the greatinvisible reality of God. To help us see that, the writer records forus the prayer of David. And what David does for us is pull back thecurtain of invisible reality and show us what is really happeningwhen the people of God give so generously -- then and now. That iswhat we need to see this morning -- what really happened in Israeland at Bethlehem when the people gave so generously.    What really happened was thatGod revealed himself. The giving of money for the house of God wasthe work of God to reveal God so that we would stand in awe of God.That is what David sees and that is what he says. Of course this isinvisible. No camera would pick up God. No reporter could interviewGod -- then or now. And there would be psychological, sociological,economic explanations for all that happened. Technically, there wereno miracles. No signs and wonders. But David says: it's all aboutGod. This is the lesson for us this morning: Shall we see God in ourlives and in the life of our church and our world the way the Bibledoes? Or will we always be seeing and thinking and talking the wayour secular world does -- while they miss everything that ultimatelymatters.    Start with me at verse 10: "SoDavid blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly." David'sresponse to all the human willing and human giving, is to bless theLord -- the Lord, not man. So he goes on and says, "Blessed art Thou,O LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever." What does it meanto "bless God"? It means to say true and good and wonderful thingsabout him that account for what happens in the world. That's whatDavid now does. He mentions at least twelve things about God that arebeing revealed in this huge generosity of giving. That is what Godwants us to see this morning. This is what has been happening atBethlehem. It's the meaning of    Freeing the Future.    It is all about the revelation of Godand the worship of God.    Freeing the Future    was and is about God -- spreading apassion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of allpeoples. We turn now to the twelve attributes, or ways, of Godrevealed in his people's generosity.    God Revealed in HisPeople's Generosity     1)    "Thine, O Lord, is the    greatness    . . ."    God is great.    He is expansive. He is larger than anyreality in the universe. When any little human greatness happens onthe earth God means for your mind and heart to think about hismagnitude and be more moved by him than by the little echo of hisgreatness that moves you here.     2)    "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness andthe    power   . . ."    God is powerful.    All power belongs to God. He is notonly big, he is strong. He is stronger than any atomic power like ahydrogen bomb, or any natural force like a hurricane or the oceantides or an exploding star. He is not only great in size, but he canmove that greatness to accomplish all he wills. He is verypowerful.     3)    "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness andthe power and the    glory    . . ."    God is glorious.    The word implies beauty and splendor.In other words, his greatness and power together are beautiful. Theyare not ugly. When we see God for who he is, our souls respond withtremendous satisfaction because we were made to behold glory. We weremade to exult in infinite beauty. God is the source and essence ofall great and powerful beauty -- all glory.     4)    "Thine, O Lord is the greatness and thepower and the glory and the    victory    . . ."    God is victorious.    The word means endurance -- lasting andpersisting and prevailing until all resistance is exhausted and Godalone stands triumphant. God is always victor. He cannot bedefeated.     5)    "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness andthe power and the glory and the victory and the    majesty    . . ."    God is majestic.    This means that he has the marks ofroyalty or kingliness. When he rides by, you take off your hat or yousalute. You don't slouch and you don't swagger. You don't joke andyou don't jest. You stand in awe, and tremble with joy that you havebeen granted to see and not die. God is majestic.     6)    "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness andthe power and the glory and the victory and the majesty,   indeed everything thatis in the heavens and the earth   ."    God owns all things.    "Thine, O Lord, is . . . everythingthat is in the heavens and the earth." God owns the world andeverything in it. He owns your home and car and television. He ownsyour mind and emotions and will and your very life. He gave it freelyas a trust, and he may take it whenever he pleases and do you nowrong. We are not our own. Nor is anything we possess our own. Godowns all of it. We are only trustees -- of life and thought andpossessions. What a revolutionary truth this is -- we need to ponderit far more often than we do.     7)    "Thine is the    dominion   , O Lord." In other words he not onlyhas the splendor of royalty, he has the authority of royalty.   He actually rules asking over the world.    Heowns all that is in the heavens and the earth and he governs what heowns -- namely, everything. He has dominion -- ruling authority asking over all. His kingly decrees always hold sway.     8)    "Thine is the dominion, O LORD, and   Thou dost exalt Thyselfas head over all   ."   God is the head over allthings, that is, the leader and final authority.    But not just that: it says he   makes himselfknown    as head over all.God is not incidentally or accidentally over all. He chooses to behead over all. He exalts himself over all. His position in theuniverse is a position he chooses to keep, his reputation as headover all is something he wills to make known. That is what washappening in Israel when the collection was taken for the temple andwhen Bethlehem Freed the Future from debt. God was exalting himselfas head over all. Not to see that is to miss the main thing that hasbeen happening.     9)    "Both riches and honorcome       from Thee . . ." Not only does God ownall things and rule all things and exalt himself as head over allthings,    he also is the   source of all riches andhonor    that come to anyman or woman or child.   This is a direct challenge to media assessment of the event. From amerely human standpoint the riches and honor came from inheritance orgood stock markets or shrewd real estate deals or savings accounts orhard work. But David says, "No, riches come from God." This is theinvisible work of God in and under and behind our work. You can't seeit. You believe it and exult in it because you believe in God, notbecause you see it with your physical eyes. And this invisiblereality is the main thing in our lives and in our church and in ourworld.    This is why it is so importantfor us to be free in the future to pursue our mission --   to spread a passion forthe supremacy of God in all things    . . ." Because so few people in ourworld see the main truths about life -- namely, that all things haveto do with God. They only see things and events and humans. Theydon't see the main reality -- God. Who exalts the supremacy of God intheir paychecks, in the stock market (up or down), in their year-endbonuses? Hardly anyone. That is why we exist -- to exult in God'sinvisible hand in it all and to spread a passion for that supremacyin all things -- all things. Riches and honor come from God.     10)    "Thou dost rule over all, and in Thyhand is power and might; and    it lies in Thy hand to make great, andto strengthen everyone   ." The new thing here isthat    all human greatnessand all human strength are the work of God's invisiblehand.    Was there somegreat systems management by Tim Johnson? Was there some great homegroup management by Char Ransom and Joby Morgan? Was there some greatfinancial management by Scott Lastine and Paul Johnson and ChuckMorris? Well, God's point in all of that was to show that "it lies inhis hand to make great." That is what has been happening in thesedays. God has been opening his hand to us.     11)    After pausing in verse 13 to burst withthanks and praise for all of this, David goes on with more about thisgreat God who has been at work in this whole affair of giving. Hesays that    this great Godis    merciful    -- God helps us dowhat we do not deserve help to do. He says in verse 14, "But who am Iand who are my people that we should be able to offer as generouslyas this? For all things come from Thee, and from Thy hand we havegiven Thee." In other words, God has enabled us to give like this,even though we do not deserve to be helped. Who are we to be sohelped to give like this? We are sinners. Bethlehem is a fellowshipof graciously saved sinners. As verse 15b says, "There is no hope"for people like us. Nevertheless God acts for us in mercy. Andbehold, we give! So the eleventh tribute to God in this matter ofgiving is that    God issovereignly merciful.          He helps us give even though we do notdeserve it. "Who are we that we should be able to give $1.1 millionin seven weeks?" We are utterly undeserving. Yet from his hand wehave given to him. For he is    merciful.      12)    Finally, jumping down to verse 18, wesee that God's enabling in this matter is not simply that he givesthe funds, but that    hegives the willingness to give.    This takes us back to where we started.Remember we said,    thepeople    did the giving.David even stresses that their    wills    were profoundly involved in the giving.In verse 9 he says: "Then the people rejoiced because they hadoffered    sowillingly   , for theymade their offering to the LORD    with a whole heart   ." They made choices. Human choices.Real choices. Joyful choices. That is what you can see. And that isall some people can see. But that is    not    all that David saw.    O God, Give a WholeHeart to Keep Your Commandments.    What David saw he makes knownto us with a petition in verses 18-19, "O LORD, the God of Abraham,Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve this forever in theintentions of the heart of Thy people, and direct their heart toThee; and give to my son Solomon a perfect [or whole] heart to keepThy commandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to dothem       all, and to build the temple, for whichI have made provision."    Where would Solomon get a heartto keep the commandments of God? Answer: From God. "O God, give to myson, Solomon, a whole heart to keep Thy commandments." And what aboutthose who were giving so generously already -- and giving, as it saysin verse 9, "willingly" and with a "whole heart" -- just as Davidprayed for his son? What about them?    David prays in verse 18, "OLord . . . keep this forever in the intentions of the heart of Thypeople, and direct their heart to Thee." When a sinner directs hisheart toward God, God has done it. David prayed, "Direct their hearttoward Thee." Apart from God our hearts go after anything but God.And apart from God we do not give willingly and joyfully to the causeof God. That is why David prays. A prayer is asking God to do whatman cannot do. We cannot direct our hearts to God or give willinglyto God unless God directs our hearts and God gives us thewillingness.    The Meaning of   Freeing theFuture     So what is the meaning ofFreeing the Future? I would answer from this text that   Freeing theFuture    was amanifestation of God. That God is   great and    powerful and    glorious and    victorious and    majestic and    owner of all things,    with dominion over alland    exalted as head over alland    source of all riches andhonor    who gives greatness andstrength to all,    who is merciful with his helpwhen we don't deserve it and    who gives the heart and thewillingness to give freely and joyfully as we have.     Freeing theFuture    is amanifestation of God. Specifically it is a manifestation of   the passion of God forthe supremacy of God in all things for the joy of allpeoples   . Which meansfor us as a church that if we live this mission, incredible thingsare in store for us. Because this passion is God's passion. To thishe will be faithful no matter what.
