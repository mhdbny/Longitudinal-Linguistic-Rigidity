  September 4, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WOMEN OF VALOR FOR NON-PROMISE KEEPERS    (1 Peter 3:1-7)        In the same way, you wives, be submissiveto your own      husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the      word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their      wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior. And      let not your adornment be merely external - braiding the hair,      and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but let it be      the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality      of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of      God. For in this way in former times the holy women also, who      hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to      their own husbands. Thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him      lord, andyou have become her children if you do what is right      without being frightened by any fear. You husbands, likewise,      live with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker      vessel, since she is a woman; and grant her honor as a fellow      heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be      hindered.         The text this morning is a call for women to be women of valor   -- especially those who are married to non-promise-keepers. You   can see what I mean by "non-promise-keepers" in verse one. There   Peter talks about women who are married to men who are   "disobedient to the word." If you are disobedient to the word you   are a "non-promise-keeper." And you can see what I mean by "women   of valor" from verse 6. The women who are married to these   non-promise-keepers are called to be daughters of Sarah (Abraham's   wife), and not to frightened by any fear. A woman of valor does   not act out of fear. She conquers fear.       So the text deals with women of valor for non-promise-keepers.   Most of you know that I am taking the term promise-keeper from the   remarkable movement that drew 250,000 men together this summer in   different stadiums around the country to worship together and to   re-commit themselves to being what Christian men are supposed to   be. The kind of men described in verse 7: "You husbands likewise,   live with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker   vessel, since she is a woman; and grant her honor as a fellow heir   of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered."   Tens of thousands of them made seven promises this summer as a   climax to the Promise Keepers ministry: 1        1. To honor Jesus Christ through worship, prayer, and obedience   to God's Word in the power of the Holy Spirit.       2. To pursue vital relationships with a few other men,   understanding that he needs brothers to help him keep his   promises.       3. To practice spiritual, moral ethical, and sexual purity.       4. To build strong marriages and families through love,   protection, and biblical values.       5. To support the mission of the church by honoring and praying   for this pastor, and by actively giving his time and resources.       6. To reach beyond any racial and denominational barriers to   demonstrate the power of biblical unity.       7. To influence his world, being obedient to the Great   Commandment and the Great Commission.       Those are good, solid, biblical commitments. And to be married   to such a man would be a good thing. Or to be a single person in a   church filled with that kind of men would also be a wonderful   thing. But the Bible is very realistic. Some Christian women are   not going to have promise-keepers for husbands. They're going to   be married to non-promise-keepers.       As the power of the kingdom moves through the world converting   people -- bringing them to out of rebellion and unbelief into   submission and faith -- it does not always convert married couples   together. Sometimes one is converted and the other not. Remember   what Jesus said, "Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on   earth? I tell you, no, but rather division; for from now on five   members in one household will be divided, three against two, and   two against three" (Luke 12:51-52).       And Peter says here in this text that sometimes the wife is in   the group of two who are converted, and the husband is in the   group of three who are not. 2   They are on opposite   sides. And this text is about how the Christian wives should live   in that situation.       Now I know that at least 90% of the people in this room are not   married to a man who is a non-promise-keeper, because you're not   married at all, or you're a man, or you're a woman who's married   to a believer. So the question is: should the 90% tune out while I   deal with women of valor for non-promise-keepers? I don't think   Peter wanted everybody else to tune out while 1 Peter 3:1-6 was   written. Which may be why he wrote it the way he did. He wrote it   so that there is specific guidance for women married to   non-promise-keepers; but he also wrote it so that the foundation   of her relationship to her husband is the same foundation all of   us can have -- and ought to have -- under all our relationships.       So let me say a word directly to the women who are married to   non-promise-keepers; and then broaden out the application to all   of us.       The first thing Peter says in verse 1 to wives married to   non-promise-keepers is "be submissive to your own husbands." Then   he repeats that admonition in verse 5: "For in this way in former   times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn   themselves, being submissive to their own husbands."       It is a great sadness that in our modern society the   complementary roles of biblical headship for the husband and   biblical submission for the wife are despised or simply passed   over for fear of being called terrible names. Some people just   write them off as sub-Christian cultural leftovers from the first   century. Others distort and misuse them -- I actually sat in my   office once with a husband who believed that submission meant his   wife should not go from one room to the other in the house without   asking his permission.       The truth lies between these two extremes, and 1 Peter 3:1-6 is   tremendously helpful in getting at what submission is and isn't.   Consider six things that submission does not mean.       1. Submission does not mean agreeing with everything your   husband says. You can see that in verse one: she is a Christian   and he is not. He has one set of ideas about ultimate reality. She   has another. Peter calls her to be submissive while assuming she   will not submit to his view of the most important thing in the   world -- God. So submission can't mean submitting to agree with   all her husband thinks.       2. Submission does not mean leaving your brain or your will at   the wedding altar. It is not the inability or the unwillingness to   think for yourself. Here is a woman who heard the gospel of Jesus   Christ. She thought about it. She assessed the truth claims of   Jesus. She apprehended in her heart the beauty and worth Christ   and his work, and she chose him. Her husband heard it also. Other   wise Peter probably wouldn't say he "disobeyed the word." He has   heard the word and he has thought about it. And he has not chosen   Christ. She thought for herself and she acted. And Peter does not   tell her to retreat from that commitment.       3. Submission is not mean avoiding every effort to change a   husband. The whole point of this text is to tell a wife how to   "win" her husband. Verse one says, "Be submissive to your own   husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word,   they may be won." If you didn't care about the Biblical context   you might say, "Submission has to mean, taking a husband the way   he is and not trying to change him." But if you care about the   context, you conclude that submission, paradoxically, is a   strategy for changing him."       The goal of this text is to help wives bring about the most   profound change in their husbands that can be imagined -- the   transformation from being a spiritually dead unbeliever to a   spiritually alive believer. Submission does not say, "I renounce   all efforts to change my husband." What it does say we'll see in a   moment.       4. Submission does not mean putting the will of the husband   before the will of Christ. The text clearly teaches that the wife   is a follower of Jesus before and above being a follower of her   husband. He is going on the path of unbelief. She does not follow   him in that, because she has been called to be a disciple of   Jesus. Submission to Jesus relativizes submission to husbands --   and governments and employers and parents. When Sara calls Abraham   "lord" in verse its lord with a little "l". It's like "sir." And   the obedience she renders is secondary obedience, under and   because of and filtered through obedience to the LORD with a   capital "L".       5. Submission does not mean that a wife gets her personal,   spiritual strength from her husband. A good husband should indeed   strengthen and build up and sustain his wife. He should be a   source of strength. There are ways in which a wife is the "weaker   vessel" as verse 7 says. But what this text shows is that when a   husbands spiritual nurturing and leadership is lacking, a   Christian wife is not bereft of strength. Submission does not mean   she is dependent on him to supply her strength of faith and virtue   and character. The text assumes just the opposite. She is summoned   to develop depth and strength and character not from her husband   but for her husband. Verse five says that her hope is in God, not   the husband.       6. Finally submission does not mean that a wife is to act out   of fear. Verse 6b says, "You have become &#91;Sarah's&#93;   children if you do what is right without being frightened by any   fear." In other words submission is free, not coerced by fear. The   Christian woman is a free woman. When she submits to her husband   -- whether he is a believer or unbeliever -- she does it in   freedom, not out of fear.       What then is submission? It is the disposition to follow a   husband's authority and an inclination to yield to his leadership.   It is an attitude that says, "I delight for you to take the   initiative in our family. I am glad when you take responsibility   for things and lead with love. I don't flourish when you are   passive and I have to make sure the family works." But the   attitude of Christian submission also says, "It grieves me when   you venture into sinful acts and want to take me with you. You   know I can't do that. I have no desire to resist you. On the   contrary, I flourish most when I can respond creatively and   joyfully to your lead; but I can't follow you into sin, as much as   I love to honor your leadership in our marriage. Christ is my   KIng."       What makes all this especially relevant for all of us is that   the foundation Peter gives to these wives is a foundation that can   and should be under all our relationships -- especially with   unbelievers. Let me mention them quickly.       1. The source of her and our strength is not ourselves or our   family, but God. Verse 5: "For in this way in former times the   holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being   submissive to their own husbands."       The secret to flourishing in difficult relationships is not to   get your strength from those relationships, but from God. Hope in   God. Look to God for the love and the security and the joy that   you long for. Then you will be able to have strength for others --   believer or unbeliever in your life.       2. Let your hope in God go to work on your inner being and make   you gentle, quiet, fearless person. I'm talking to men and women   here. It will have its distinct, complementary form and expression   in men and women, but it will be there in both, if they hope in   God and not themselves or in other people or circumstances. Verses   3 and 4 show us the way: "And let not your adornment be merely   external-- braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting   on dresses; but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the   imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is   precious in the sight of God."       In other words, when you hope in God, you're not all caught up   in externals like make-up and hair styles and earrings and   clothes. What you are caught up in is becoming a deep, settled,   strong, tranquil, gentle, fearless person -- what I like to call a   woman of valor. Or a man of valor. That's what begins to happen   when you pin your hopes on God and not man.       3. People who hope in God and begin to become deep, tranquil,   strong, gentle, fearless persons on the inside start to act   outwardly in ways of purity and reverence and humility and   servanthood that are visibly winsome.       You can see that his is what Peter is really after in verse   1b-2. He wants the unbelieving husband to be won over. He wants   him to be saved -- to be a fellow heir of the grace of life with   his wife (as v. 7 says). But notice how he hope this will happen:   "&#91;So that&#93; they may be won without a word by the behavior   of their wives, 2 as they observe your chaste and respectful   behavior." The "hidden person of the heart" in verse 4 is now   visible. What you become on the inside by hoping in God eventually   shows in behavior that is pure and respectful and winsome.       ***       Some of us are married to non-promise-keepers. All of us know   and relate to some non-promise-keepers. The burden and the passion   of our hearts more and more should be to win them for the Lord's   sake and for their own eternal joy.       To that end I call us all to be like the holy women of old, and   to hope in God, not in husband or wife or children or job or   insurance or investment or government, but in God.       And from that great security in God cultivate the imperishable   inner person of depth and tranquility and stability and quietness   and strength and fearlessness that Peter says is very precious to   God. Be men and women of holy, God-centered valor.       And from that inner person let your behavior become more and   more pure and reverent and servant-like -- if by any means we   might win some non-promise-keepers to Christ and his kingdom.         1  These promises are taken from Al Janssen and Larry K.   Weeden, eds, Seven Promise of a Promise Keeper, (Colorado Springs:   Focus on the Family Publishing, 1994), p. 8.        2  We know that Peter is referring to unbelieving   husbands in 3:1, because "disobedient to the word" in 1 Peter does   not mean Christians who fall short of being good husbands. It   means non-Christians. We know this because in 1 Peter 2:8 the very   same phrase occurs, "disobedient to the word," and we can see from   2:7 that these people are called "those who disbelieve."
