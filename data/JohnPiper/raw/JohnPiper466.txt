        "I AM GOD ALMIGHTY, BE FRUITFUL ANDMULTIPLY"        WALK IN WISDOM: SEIZE THEMOMENT      Colossians 4:2-6    (Continued on Sunday Evening)   
  Colossians 4:5-6:  Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the mostof the opportunity. 6 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, as it were,  with salt, so that you may know how you shouldrespond to each person.  This morning I suggested that these five things needed comment.The first one we took up this morning. The other four are really anexpansion and explanation of the first. So we continue.  1. What does it mean (literally) to "walk in wisdom toward thoseoutside"? What is this wisdom? What is it's aim and origin?  2. What does it mean to "make the most of (literally: purchase)the opportunity"? What is the opportunity and how do you purchase it?  3. How do you "let your speech always be with (or in) grace"?  4. What does it mean to be seasoned with salt?  5. How do you know how to respond to each person? Why does heassume that people will say things that need to be responded to?  2. Colossians 4:5b: "Make the most of the opportunity."  Literally it is "purchase the time or season or opportunity."  These are valuable and more worth buying up. It might mean andunusual time alone. It might mean an unusual openness. It might meanand unusual comment made over lunch about Christ or Christianity. Butbeware of the error of waiting for the so-called perfect moment. Paulwent from city to city and entered the synagogue and preached.Sometimes they were eager to hear and sometime they were hostile. Theopportunity may simply be the Sabbath when the crowd is gathered inthe synagogue, not when they are "prepared to hear."  2.2 The word "purchase" implies a sacrifice or loss of somethingto gain something else.  It's used four times in the NT (Gal. 3:13; 4:5; Eph. 5:16). InGalatians 3:13 Paul says, "Christ  redeemed  us from the curseof the Law, having become a curse for us." So here the price wasChrist's becoming a curse for us, and the gain was our rescue fromthe curse of God. So to "redeem the time" means to take whateverpainful steps are necessary to get the gain we are after.  2.3 The parallel in Ephesians 4:15-16 shows that the need foraggressive purchasing of the opportunity is that the days are evil.  "Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but aswise, 16 making the most of your time, because the days are evil."  This shows that Paul's concern is that coasting in the Christianlife, waiting for fruit to fall in our lap is not going to work. Why?Because the prevailing powers in this fallen age are evil. That is,there are powers every day working to keep people from beinginterested in the gospel and to keep them a way from witnesses and tokeep you away from them. It's this prevailing evil ("god of this age"and "prince of the power of the air") that makes it urgent that wesacrificial purchase any opportunity that comes along. No coasting.No mere waiting. The current of the stream of culture is away fromheaven. If we don't row, we will drift with it toward destruction.  2.4. Examples:  2.41 -- Decision magazine this month. A wrong address given to avisitation team in a trailer park. The wrong address proves to be aman that is in need of getting right with God and a 95 year oldmother who needs Christ and finds him as the team deals with her son.  2.42 -- Paul and Silas in the prison. Acts 16:24-25, "They threwthem into the inner prison, and fastened their feet in the stocks. 25But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns ofpraise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them."  2.43 -- Jesus at the well with the woman with five husbands. John4:7-9,  "There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her,'Give Me a drink.' 8 For His disciples had gone away into the city tobuy food. 9 The Samaritan woman therefore said to Him, 'How is itthat You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritanwoman?' (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)"  2.44 -- Paul about to be taken to prison in Jerusalem. Acts21:37-22:1,  And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said tothe commander, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do youknow Greek? . . . But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, acitizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak tothe people." 40 And when he had given him permission, Paul, standingon the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when therewas a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,22:1 "Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now  offer to you."  2.45 -- Any time of crisis that looks aimless. Luke 21:12-13,  "But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you andwill persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons,bringing you before kings and governors for My name's sake. 13 Itwill lead to an opportunity for your testimony."  3. Colossians 4:6a: "Let your speech always be with grace."  3.1 Matthew 10:8, "Freely you have received, freely give." Thegospel is an offer of forgiveness and reconciliation and eternallife, for free!!  3.2 Speak by faith, i.e., relying not on yourself but on grace.  Compare 2 Corinthians 1:12 "For our proud confidence is this, thetestimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity,not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conductedourselves in the world, and especially toward you." Fleshly wisdom iswisdom without faith and without looking to God's word and Spirit.The human counterpart to grace is faith.  3.3. Does this mean that there is not place for tough words orwarning and even judgment? Probably there is, since Jesus told theapostles to wipe the dust off their feet as a testimony against them(Mark 6:11) and this is what Paul did (Acts 18:6). Romans 2:4-5 saysthat mercy spurned becomes judgment.  4. Colossians 4:6b, "Seasoned with Salt."  I suggest that our lives and our speech are seasoned with saltwhen they are "radically" devoted to the cause of Christ, in thesacrifices we make and the countercultural life-style that we lead.Salty is the opposite of blah, ordinary, tasteless. I get this fromthe uses of salt in the following texts.  Luke 14:33-35  "So therefore, no one of you can be My disciple who does not give  up all his own possessions. 34 "Therefore, salt is good;but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?35 "It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it isthrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."  Matthew 5:11-16  11 "Blessed are you when  men  cast insults at you, andpersecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, onaccount of Me. 12 "Rejoice, and be glad, for your reward in heaven isgreat, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. 13"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless,how will it be made salty  again ? It is good for nothinganymore, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. 14"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot behidden. 15 "Nor do  men  light a lamp, and put it under thepeck-measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all who arein the house. 16 "Let your light shine before men in such a way thatthey may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is inheaven.  5. Colossians 4:6c, ". . . so that you may know how you shouldrespond to each person."  Why are the people asking questions that need a response? See 1Peter 3:14-15,  But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are  blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DONOT BE TROUBLED, 15 but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,always  being  ready to make a defense to everyone who asks youto give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentlenessand reverence.  The thing they are asking about is HOPE. How is hope in God madevisible -- with a salty lifestyle. Sacrificing ease implies benefitsexpected in the future. So people ask about hope! The salt createsthe thirst!!!  Is the clause, "to know how to answer . . ." dependent on theimmediately preceding "words with grace" and "seasoned with salt"? Oris it dependent back on "walk in wisdom toward outsiders?  If the latter then we are pointed back to the challenge to becomewise people by letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col.3:16).  If it is the former, then what Paul is saying is that the give andtake of daily life among unbelievers with the efforts to speak withgrace and the efforts to live a salty life -- this is a real schoolfor learning "how to answer each one." We learn not only from thewords of Christ in scripture, but also from the real experience withChrist in the market place.  6. Conclusion.  Pray for open doors and for courageous clarity.  Meditate on the words of Christ richly so as to become wise.  Throw yourself into the opportunities you have, and learn bydoing.  Copyright 1996 John Piper
