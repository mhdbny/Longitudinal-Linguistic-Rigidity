  May 22, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       THE WAR AGAINST THE SOUL    AND THE GLORY OF GOD    (1 Peter 2:11-12)        Beloved, I urge you as aliens andstrangers to abstain      from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul. Keep your      behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in      which they slander you as evildoers, they may on account of      your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day      of visitation.             What these two verses make clear is that there are two tremendous   issues in the world. They are, I think, the most important issues   in the world. And one of the reasons we know that we are aliens   and strangers in the world is that the modern world we live in   does not believe that these two issues are the main issues. If the   world believed this, the newspaper and the television and the   theater and the university and popular music and industry mission   statements and government goals would look and sound very   different than they do. But in fact we live in a world that shows   by its priorities and values and commitments and standards and   preoccupations and pleasures that it does not regard these two   issues as paramount. In fact, they are not even on the list of the   world's priorities.       The two issues that dominate these two verses -- and indeed   dominate the whole New Testament -- are the salvation of the human   soul and the glory of God. The two great issues of the Bible are   how the soul of man might not be destroyed and how the glory of   God might not be belittled.       Salvation of the Soul       In verse 11 Peter says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and   strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against   the soul." The ultimate issue in that verse is that the human soul   is in danger of being destroyed. A war is being waged against the   soul in this world. If the war is successful, the soul is lost.       Jesus said, "What will it profit a man if he gain the whole   world and lose his soul. For what can a man give in exchange for   his soul?" (Matt. 16:26). If the soul is lost, the whole person is   lost. And there is no way to negotiate to get it back. When this   war against the soul is over, it's over. There is a great gulf   fixed and none can cross one way or the other -- from heaven or   from hell (Luke 16:26). If the anti-soul forces win this war, the   soul is lost for ever.       So this is one of the great issues in the world. It affects   everybody without exception. And it affects everybody forever. And   it affects everybody forever in an ultimately serious way. And yet   our world does not give serious attention to it. There is no   column in the newspaper, there is no public service announcement   on the radio, there is no soundbite on television, there is no   values-clarification course in our schools, there is no government   agency or even a welfare pamphlet that counsels us how to wage war   for the eternal life of our souls. We are told how to wage war   against AIDS; against sunstroke; against mosquitoes; against drunk   driving and pollen and depression and rape and fire and theft and   cholesterol and dandelions. But the world we live in gives no   counsel on how to fight for the eternal life of the soul.       Our modern world is massively preoccupied with the   inconsequential. We are so oblivious as a culture to what will one   day seem so obvious that we will call ourselves blind for not   seeing it -- namely, the eternal well-being of the soul and its   relation to God. Is it any wonder that Peter begins this second   section of his letter the same way he did the first one by calling   us "aliens and strangers" (cf. 1:1)?       That's the first great issue in these two verses and in the   Bible -- the salvation of the soul. It's the issue of how to wage   war so that we will not lose our souls.       The Glory of God       The second great issue is mentioned in verse 12 -- the issue of   the glory of God. In verse 11 the issue is how the soul might not   be destroyed. In verse 12 the issue is how the glory of God might   not be belittled:       "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in   the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may on   account of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in   the day of visitation."       The goal of human behavior is the glory of God. "Keep your   behavior excellent so that . . . the gentiles might glorify God."   The positive significance of our lives is derived from whether our   lives direct people's attention to the glory of God.       If we live our lives in such a way that they don't point people   to the glory of God, then our lives are without positive   significance from a Christian standpoint. What we become is just   an echo of a God-neglecting culture. We fit into the world so well   that our lives don't point beyond the world. We are no longer   aliens and strangers, but simply conforming citizens of the   God-ignoring world.       But from the Biblical standpoint the greatest issue in this   world is the glory of God. All human behavior is meant by God to   get attention for God. "Keep your behavior excellent so that they   will glorify God." As far as God is concerned your life has   positive significance to the degree that what you do from the time   you get up in the morning till the time you go to bed at night   points people to the glory of God. (Keep in mind, lest you infer   from this that solitude has no positive significance, you are one   of the people you are to point to God.)       So there are two great issues in the world -- the salvation of   the soul and the glory of God. Or: how the soul of man might not   be destroyed and how the glory of God might not be belittled.       In one sense I would be satisfied this morning if you would   embrace just that with all your heart. If that were the deep   conviction of your soul and driving confidence of your heart, I   think the rest of this text would take care of itself.       The reason I say this is that the most basic issue in modern   life seems to me to be the absence of the supremacy and centrality   of God. And what is needed so desperately in the world is people   for whom God is everything. I agree with David Wells in his new   book called God in the Wasteland when he says,       It is one of the defining marks of Our Time that God is now   weightless. I do not mean by this that he is ethereal but rather   that he has become unimportant. He rests upon the world so   inconsequentially as not to be noticeable. he has lost his   saliency for human life. Those who assure the pollsters of their   belief in God's existence may nonetheless consider him less   interesting than television, his commands less authoritative than   their appetites for affluence and influence, his judgments no more   awe-inspiring than the evening news, and his truth less compelling   than the advertiser's sweet fog of flattery and lies. That is   weightlessness. It is a condition we have assigned him after   having nudged him out to the periphery of our secularized life.   His truth is no longer welcome in our public discourse. The engine   of modernity rumbles on, and he is but a speck in its path (p.   88).       So if a thousand people this morning would not just give lip   service to this text, but make it the overarching, integrating   truth of our lives -- that the two great issues in the world are   how the soul might be saved and how God might be glorified -- then   God might become heavy again in a thousand spheres around these   cities instead of being weightless and unimportant. And then maybe   the gospel of gracious salvation from the wrath of a holy God   would make sense and be believed.       But there is more in this text. And since I believe God put it   there to help make the text real in our lives, let me spend the   time we have left helping us focus our minds and hearts on it.       I'll just mention two things.       Aliens, Exiles and Strangers       Peter has mentioned twice already (in 1:1 and 1:17) that true   Christians are aliens and exiles and strangers on the earth. Here   in verse 11 he mentions it a third time, "Beloved, I urge you as   aliens and strangers . . ." He must regard this as important. So   we should too.       It will help us restore the weightiness and importance of God   in our world if we remember that we are aliens and exiles. The   reason we are aliens was given in verse 9: "You are a chosen race   a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own   possession . . . he called you out of darkness into his marvelous   light." We belong to God, not to the world and not to America. We   learn to live from him, not from television or fashion catalogues.   We are aliens because we are God's.       We must cultivate the mindset of exiles. What this does mainly   is sober us up and wake us up so that we don't drift with the   world and take for granted that the way the world thinks and acts   is the best way. We don't assume that what is on TV is helpful to   the soul; we don't assume that the priorities of advertisers is   helpful to the soul; we don't assume that the strategies and   values of business and industry are helpful to the soul. We don't   assume that any of this glorifies God. We stop and we think and we   consult the Wisdom of our own country, heaven, and we don't assume   that the conventional wisdom of this age is God's wisdom. We get   our bearings from God in his word.       When you see yourself as an alien and an exile with your   citizenship in heaven, and God as your only Sovereign, you stop   drifting with the current of the day. You ponder what is good for   the soul and what honors God in everything: food, cars, videos,   bathing suits, birth control, driving speeds, bed times, financial   savings, education for the children, unreached peoples, famine,   refugee camps, sports, death, and everything else. Aliens get   their cue from God and not the world.       So one way to make God visible and weighty for the sake of our   world is to see ourselves as exiles and refugees from heaven.       The Battle: For Desires First, Then Behavior       Another thing to notice in this text is that the battle for the   soul and the battle for the glory of God is fought first at the   level of our desires and then at the level of our behavior --   first at the level of what we feel and then at the level of what   we do.       Verse 11 says that it is "fleshly lusts (or desires) that wage   war against the soul". So Peter says abstain from them. Then in   verse 12 Peter says we should keep our "behavior" excellent so   that people will see and give glory to God. So first he focuses on   desires and then on behavior. This is the same pattern we saw in   1:14-15. "Don't conform to the desires of your former ignorance,   but . . . be holy in all your conduct." Fight first at the level   of desires and then at the level of conduct.       The reason for this is that conduct is not excellent -- it is   not beautiful; it is not going to point people to the glory of God   -- if it does not flow from right desires. Jesus said, "Woe to you   scribes and pharisees! Hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of   the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and   rapacity" (Matt. 23:25). In other words, it doesn't do any good to   try to shine up the conduct on the outside without changing the   desires on the inside. There is a different sound to a barrel full   of leaves and a barrel full of oil.       How does verse 12 work? How does excellent behavior point   people to the glory of God? The answer, I think, is given in 1   Peter 3:15. "Always be ready to make a defense to everyone who   asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you." What   they see is some external action, and what they ask about is your   internal hope.       What Peter is saying here is that when people look at you what   they see expressed in your actions is what you hope in. So they   see a certain way of acting -- some humble act of love (Gal. 5:6)   or some righteous act courage (Heb. 10:34) or some self-denying   act of generosity (2 Cor. 8:1-2) -- and they notice that you must   not be hoping in what people usually hope in -- self-exaltation,   safety, money -- and they are puzzled as to where your hope is. So   they ask about your hope: where do you get your confidence, your   contentment, your satisfaction when you act that way?       When we direct our desires to God and find hope and contentment   in his mercy and power and promises, then our outward life starts   to show what Peter calls "excellent behavior" -- a humble love and   fearless courage and self-denying generosity and joyful simplicity   and peaceful suffering. These behaviors point to God's glory   because they point to a stable, sure, satisfying object of desire   and hope that is not of this world.       So if you want to fight for the soul that it not be   destroyed,    and if you want to magnify the glory of God so that it not be   belittled,    and if you want to say yes to the weight and importance of God in   this God-neglecting modern world,    then see yourself as an exile from heaven    and focus your desires on God so that your hope is in him and not   in this world,    and the result will be an emerging beauty of behavior that   conquers all slander    and finally brings praise to God.
