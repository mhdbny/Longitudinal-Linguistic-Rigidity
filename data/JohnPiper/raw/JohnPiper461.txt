    December 17, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Son of Man Did Not Come    to Be served but to Serve (Part 1)   (Mark 10:45)           For even the Son of Man did not come tobe served, but to serve,    and to give His life a ransom for many.         Introduction: Christmas Is About. . .     Today and next Sunday I want to meditatewith you on Mark 10:45. It  is a very important Christmas text.     Christmas is about the coming of Christ intothe world.           It&#146;s about the Son of God, whoexisted eternally with the Father      as the radiance of his glory and the exactrepresentation of his nature,      taking on human nature and becoming a man (Hebrews 1:3).            It&#146;s about the birth of a man by avirgin conceived miraculously      (not sexually) by the Holy Spirit so that he is the Son ofGod, not the way you and I are      sons of God, but in an utterly unique way (Luke 1:35).            It&#146;s about the coming of a man namedJesus in whom all the      fullness of deity was pleased to dwell (Colossians2:9).            It&#146;s about the coming of thefullness of time that      had been prophesied by the prophets of old that                         A Ruler would be born in Bethlehem (Micah5:2);         and a child would be born called WonderfulCounselor, Mighty God,      Eternal Father, Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6);         and a Messiah, an anointed one, a shootfrom the stem of Jesse, a son      of David, a King would come (Isaiah 11:1-4; Zechariah 9:9)           And, according to our text today, Christmasis about the coming of the    Son of Man who came not to be served but to serve and togive his life as a ransom    for many (Mark 10:45).       This brief expression of Christmas in Mark10:45 is what I hope God  will fix in your mind and heart this year so that your faith infuture grace will be  strengthened and so that you will have a clear, short word ofexplanation that you can  refer to when you are talking to others about what Christmasreally means.    So we will take it, one step at a time and makesure that the words are  clear and that we understand why Jesus said them in thiscontext.     Whoever Wishes to Become Great. . .Shall BeSlave of All     Let&#146;s get the story clear: James andJohn, two of Jesus  disciples -- the sons of thunder -- came up to him and said (inverse 35),           


 Teacher, we wantyou to do for us whatever    we ask of you.     


 And Jesus said to them, What do youwant Me to do for you?     


 And they said to Him, Grant that we maysit in your glory, one on    your right, and one on your left.      


 But Jesus said to them, You do not knowwhat you are asking for.    Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptizedwith the baptism with which    I am baptized?      


 And they said to Him, We areable.      


 And Jesus said to them, The cup that Idrink you shall drink; and    you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.But to sit on My    right or on my left, this is not mine to give; but it is forthose for whom it has been    prepared.         James and John get one thing right here, andmost everything else  wrong. They are right in verse 37 when they say that Jesus isdestined for glory --  When you sit in your glory. And that is a good thingto be right about. There  are some people in this room who are not yet right about that.Here&#146;s how you can  tell. If you know that a company&#146;s stock is going to take offand go through the roof  you buy that stock and not the competitor&#146;s. If you know thisbuilding is going to  stand after the storm and no others, you get in this building, andnot the others. And if  you know that Jesus is going to reign in glory in the end overevery rival, then you  follow Jesus and not his rivals. And some are not following Jesusand so don&#146;t have  it right yet about his glory. You&#146;re not yet as far along asJames and John.    They had that right. Jesus would take hiskingly seat in glory someday  and rule the world. Nobody really believes this, who isn&#146;tfollowing Jesus.    But they probably didn&#146;t understand thecup and the baptism that  Jesus was talking about in verse 38, Are you able to drinkthe cup that I drink, or  to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?They said yes. But did  they know? What was he talking about?    What is this cup? In the garden of Gethsemane,Jesus pleaded with his  Father, if there was another way besides the horror of crucifixionand abandonment, would  he please take that way. But these were the words he used,           Abba! Father! All things are possible foryou; remove this  cup  from    me; yet not what I will, but what you will. (Mark14:36)        The cup was the death he was about to endure.So he was saying to James  and John: if you want to rule with me in my glory the way you areasking, then you must  die with me -- you must drink the same cup.    And did they understand the baptism? Areyou able to . . . be  baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? In Luke12:50 Jesus said,  I have a baptism to undergo, and how constrained I am untilit is  accomplished! Jesus saw his death not only as a bitter cupto drink but an immersion  -- a baptism -- in suffering. He said, in effect, my pathway toglory and to kingship is  through suffering and death. If you want the kind of honor you areasking for, you must  follow me in my suffering and death.     But there will be others who will follow likethis, and I have only one  right hand and one left hand. Who shall sit there? Verse 40: Theone for whom it has been  prepared by my Father. God the Father has decided this. It is notmine to change now.    So what he has done is take their desire forglory and show them that  the path to glory is a pathway through suffering and death. Thatis what Christmas means:  on Jesus pathway from glory to glory he came here to pass throughsuffering and death. Now  he says, Do you want to be great in glory with me? Walk withme on this path of  suffering.    What happens then is that the other disciplesget bent out of shape  because of James and John&#146;s aggressive claim on the places ofhonor in the kingdom.  What will Jesus say to them. He says basically the same thing hesaid to James and John,  only with different words. Watch how he does it. Verse 41 saysthey are indignant with  James and John. So Jesus calls them all around and says (in verse42),           You know that those who are recognized asrulers of the Gentiles    lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority overthem. 43) But it is not so    among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall beyour servant; 44) and    whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave ofall.        Now that is the same as saying to James andJohn: if you want to be  great with me in my glory you must drink the cup of my suffering.If you disciples want to  get in on the greatness, you must be a servant, and if you want tobe first, the way James  and John asked about the first places, you must be slave of all.But what does slave of  all mean?    In the next verse, (10:45) he gives an exampleof what he means,  namely, himself. For even the Son of Man did not come to beserved, but to serve,  and to give His life a ransom for many. Notice the pointhere is serving that  results in dying -- a giving up of his life. So in verse 38, whenhe showed James and John  the way to glory, he said that they would need to drink his cupand share his baptism,  namely, death. And here in verse 45, when he shows the rest of thedisciples the way to  greatness, he gives his own death as an example: the Son ofMan came to give his  life as a ransom for many. In both cases he is giving hisdeath as an example of the  kind of suffering and service that the disciples are called to.    That&#146;s the context of verse 45. It is partof a very radical call  to discipleship. If you want to follow me and seek the glory ofthe kingdom, be prepared  to suffer. That is the way I go and those who follow me go thesame way. I don&#146;t take  the hard road while you take the easy road. The road that leads tolife is hard and few  there be that find it (Matthew 7:14). We take the same road.He who would come after  me must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me(Mark 8:34).     The Radical Call to Be Served By Jesus     Now in that context Jesus gives a powerfulChristmas promise of  future grace. As far as I know no other religious leader in thehistory of the world has  done what Jesus promised here. He says in effect in verse 45 thatthis radical call to  discipleship -- this call to come and drink the cup of sufferingand service -- this is  not   a call to serve Jesus, but a call to be served by Jesus as weserve others and to be  ransomed by him from death. Let me say this again, to be sure youhear it correctly:  the  good news ( the good news of Christmas) is that the radical callto Christian discipleship  is NOT a call to serve Jesus, but to be served by Jesus as weserve others, and to be  ransomed by him from death .    You see this in verse 45: The Son of Mandid not come to be  served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom formany. At first this only  sounds like an example to follow, right? Don&#146;t lord it overyour fellows, serve  them.. Why: because the Son of Man set you an example: he serves.He gives his life. So at  first the verse sounds like an example to follow.    But then you ponder for a few moments and ithits you. Wait a minute!  This is not just an example, for me to follow. He is not justsaying, Serve the way  I serve. This is the Son of Man serving me! Ransoming mefrom my sin and my death!  Refusing to be served by me. Insisting on being the Servant andthe Savior in my life.    This is not just another teacher with somerules about how to live,  gathering some radical disciples to live the way he lives and stirup a revolution. This  is a man (and more than a man!) telling his disciples that he hascome into the world to  serve them; he does not want them to serve him and he will laydown his life so that their  lives can be ransomed from sin and death. This is unheard of.. Youneed to feel how wild  this is. No man ever spoke this way -- except maybe in a mentalhospital. No respected  religious leader ever spoke this way. Either Jesus is above everyordinary teacher, with  some supernatural power and dignity, or he is a lunatic.    When he calls for radical, self-sacrificingdiscipleship, he gives a  reason in verse 45: For (note the word!) even the Son of Mandid not come to be  served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom ofmany. Yes, this is a call  to act the way he acted. But O so much more! The Son of Man didnot come to be served, but  to serve! Not to be served by whom? Whom does he not want to beserved by? Answer: the  very disciples that he is calling to drink his cup and endure hisbaptism and to be the  slave of all.    He is saying: Yes, drink my cup. Yes, share mybaptism. Yes, serve  others. Yes, be the slave of all. This is what it means to be mydisciple. But don&#146;t  serve me! I have not come to be served. I will not be served likethis. I will be the  servant. I have not come to be served, but to serve. In yourrelationship with me, I will  be the servant. I will serve you. I will work for you.    Do you think you can drink this cup without myhelp and service? Do you  think you can endure the suffering of my baptism without myserving you and helping you?  Do you think you can become the kind of person that renounces fameand human status to  serve all other people without my serving you -- day and night allthe days of your life?  No you can&#146;t.     Do you recall what Jesus said in John 15:5?           I am the vine, you are the branches; hewho abides in Me, and I in    him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can donothing.        Apart from me you can do nothing. You cannotdrink my cup. You cannot  endure my baptism. You cannot serve each other. You cannot becomethe slave of all. To do  any of this, you must abide in me and I in you. Youmust trust me to serve  you. Abiding in the vine and being served by Jesus are the samething. And both are the  same as living by faith in future grace.    Jesus is saying, Christmas means that theSon of Man comes. And  when he comes he  demands  something and he  promises something. He demands  your life. All of it. He demands that you take on a life-stylethat sacrifices everything  for the sake of serving others (Luke 14:33). This is hard. Infact, it is impossible.  That&#146;s what Jesus said to the disciples in Mark 10:27 whenthey said, Who then  can be saved? He said, With men it is impossible, butnot with God; for all  things are possible with God. It is impossible to drink thecup of suffering. It is  impossible to become everybody&#146;s servant. UNLESS . . .    That is what verse 45 is all about. The greatUNLESS . . .Unless the  Son of Man is serving you day and night.    Mark 10:45 is what turns Christianity intogospel. If Christianity were  only a great and radical teacher calling for the sacrificialobedience of radical  disciples, it would not be good news. It would be just anotherideology. Another  philosophy. Another moral improvement program. If Christmas onlymeant that a man appeared  on the scene of history to call others to be servants, it wouldnot be good news.     We know that already. We know intuitively thatwe are to love and serve  and sacrifice, rather than boast and seek our own status and lordit over others. We  don&#146;t need a Messiah to tell us that. What we need issalvation from guilt and death  and hell. And we need power to drink the cup of suffering in thepath of service. We  don&#146;t need another religious leader to say Followme. We don&#146;t need  another prophet, like Mohammed. We don&#146;t need anotherphilosophical Buddha or  Confucius, or another political organizer like Karl Marx or MaoZedong. We don&#146;t need  any more New Age mysticisms or psychological self-help strategies.What we need is Someone  who can forgive our sins and ransom us from guilt and death andthe wrath of God, and who  can give us a new life with the power die for each other in theservice of love.    That is what Christmas is all about. That iswhat Mark 10:45 is all  about. Jesus does not merely come as another teacher orphilosopher or politician or  mystic. He comes to do two things. One: to give his life as aransom for many. (We will  dig into that great work next week.) And he comes, secondly, toserve his disciples -- to  serve all those who will stop trying to earn his approval byserving him, and will humble  themselves like little children and let him serve them. This isthe help we need and the  power we need. He is our Redeemer from guilt and death and hell.He is our helper day in  and day out as he serves us by the power of his Spirit.    I commend him to you for your trust. For yourenjoyment this Christmas.    Our new daughter, Talitha Ruth, arrived in ourhome Friday night at 9  1/2 weeks old. She smiled. She cooed. She ate. And she fell asleepin her crib. And slept  for seven hours. She did not serve us at all. She is totallydependent our being served by  us. If she insists on serving us rather than our serving her, shewill die. This is why  Jesus said, Unless you turn and become like children, youwill not enter the kingdom  of heaven. (Matthew 18:3).     It&#146;s almost Christmas. Open your heart toreceive the best  Christmas present imaginable. Jesus giving himself to die for youand serve you, all the  rest of eternity. Receive this. Turn away from self-help and sin.Become like little  children. Trust him. Trust him. Trust him with your life.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
