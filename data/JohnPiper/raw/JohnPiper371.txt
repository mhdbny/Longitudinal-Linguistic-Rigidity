 January 31, 1993    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WHY A CHURCH COVENANT?    (Hebrews 8)       
       Last fall we spent almost all our Sunday morning messages and   all our BITC Plenary Sessions searching the Scriptures to answer   the question, What does it mean to be the church today?       Those reflections are now bearing fruit in several ways.       (1) Our study is bearing fruit in a heightened sense of   priority for ministering to each other in small groups--not just   studying, but transmitting God's grace to each other in love, and   meeting each other's needs and strengthening each other's faith,   and sustaining each other's hope, and keeping each other focused   on God, running the race with perseverance.       (2) Our study is bearing fruit in a wider shepherding effort   coordinated with this small group network, and overseen by the   elders. The aim is to do the best we can not to lose track of   people who are not in one of our small groups but who are part of   the body and would benefit from regular contact with the   leadership of the church. The elders is to have this structure in   place some time in March.       (3) Our study is bearing fruit in a renewed commitment to   foster a ministry mindset in all the members and to create an   atmosphere that releases your vision for how to meet needs in the   body and spread the truth and beauty of Christ in the city. The   elders and ministerial staff exist to equip the saints to dream   and do the ministry. We do this through teaching and prayer and   inspiration and coordination and oversight, but we do not see   ourselves as the primary inventors and organizers of ministry. For   example, I see one of my main roles at Bethlehem as fostering a   spirit of hope in God and joy in God where the Holy Spirit   releases energy for ministry through your initiatives--and not   just in-house initiatives but initiatives unique to your   professions and occupations and trades;       (4) Our study is bearing fruit in a deepened sense that   structure is not the essential problem when we are not what we   ought to be--like not as outgoing to strangers, or not as   sensitive to hurts in the body, or not as aggressive in   evangelism. Structure is part of the problem, but again and again   in our Plenary Sessions last fall people would say, what we are   striving for is not the fruit of right structure but right spirit.       All the structure in the world won't create love and openness   and vulnerability and authenticity and friendliness and   self-denying acts of kindness. The most basic issue is a spiritual   one and the upshot of this insight is that we will not leave this   issue behind and say, "O, good, we spent a few months on that. Now   we can forget it and go on to something else. Rather, we know more   than ever that, in one sense, we must never leave this issue, but   humble ourselves continually and look into our own hearts for   stumbling blocks and pray without ceasing that the spirit of love   will abound for the new-comer and the old-comer and the   invisible-comer and the no-longer-comer and the no-comer.       (5) Finally, our study is bearing fruit in sending us back to   the covenantal meaning of the local church. For over a decade all   the members that have been received into the church have been   instructed to read the Affirmation of Faith and the Church   Covenant and to assent to them as part of their membership   commitment. But in all that time we have never studied the   covenant or given it a prominent place in our life together.       The elders see this as one of the causes of our present   weaknesses. We have not been clear and public and well-taught   about what it means to be people gathered into a local church by   covenant. For example, not once in the past decade have we woven   the reading of our church covenant into a ceremony of receiving   new members.       This omission has worked with other forces to reduce the   Biblical significance of being part of a covenant community. So   one of the main results of last fall's study is that the elders   plan to reverse this trend and put the covenant in a more   prominent position as part of the meaning of membership at   Bethlehem, and the process of becoming a member.       This is one of the ways that the crucial issue of what it means   to be church will be kept at the forefront of our ministry. For   example, the elders plan that beginning some time this spring we   will have periodic Sunday morning covenant affirmations which   would take about the same amount of time as the baby dedications   and would involve all the new members in standing before the   congregation and affirming their covenant commitment along with   the rest of us by answering "I do" to five questions based on the   five paragraphs of the church covenant. We think that this solemn,   public act of mutual covenant affirmation and renewal in the most   prominent service of the week will go a long way to awakening us   again and again to the meaning of our common commitments as a   church.--or what it means to be church for each other and for the   world and for the glory of God.       What this means now is that for the next several Sundays I am   going to try to help us recover a Biblical and historical sense of   what a church covenant is and why we have one and what it means to   be a people in covenant with each other.       At the end of this series our intention is that we would have a   covenant renewal Sunday in which the members of the church would   solemnly reaffirm our commitment to Christ and to each other   through the covenant of our church.       Let me begin today with a definition of the term "covenant." A   covenant is "an agreement or mutual obligation, contracted   deliberately and with solemnity" (Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, Vol.   1, p. 562).       But there is a problem with that definition, when it comes to   God's making a covenant with man. In that case the terms of the   covenant are not mutually decided on. God does not negotiate with   anyone as to the degree of their allegiance to him. He comes to us   and offers a covenant relationship with the terms already decided.       Psalm 111:9 says, "He has commanded his covenant for ever. Holy   and terrible is his name." Judges 2:20 says, "This nation has   transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers." So   there is mutual obligation, but not mutual determination of what   those obligations are. God comes to the covenant knowing what is   best for us and we come trusting and obeying or not at all. In a   covenant between God and man, God sets the obligations, not man.       But the glory of God's covenants with man is that God also puts   himself under obligation with solemn promises. For example,       God says to Noah, "I establish my covenant with you . . . and   never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth" (Gen.   9:11).       And to Abraham God says, "I will make my covenant between me   and you and I will multiply you exceedingly . . . you shall be the   father of a multitude of nations" (Gen. 17:2,4).       And to Moses God says, "Behold, I make a covenant. Before all   your people I will do marvels such as have not been wrought in all   the earth" (Exodus 34:10).       And to David God said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen   one, I have sworn to David my servant, I will establish your   descendants for ever, I will build your throne for all   generations" (Psalm 89:3-4).       So the glory of God's covenants with man is that God obligates   himself with solemn promises.       Our text today, Hebrews 8, contrasts two covenants. Both of   them are initiated by God. The reason they are relevant for   thinking about a church covenant among believers is that both of   them are designed to bring a people into special relationship with   God and with each other: the first was the covenant with Israel   that God made when he took them out of Egypt; and the other   covenant--the new covenant--is the one God made with the church   when Jesus died for the church and rose from the dead. The first   covenant created the nation of Israel and the new covenant created   the church, the true spiritual Israel, and will eventually gather   in the converted nation of Israel as well (Romans 11:26-27).       The main difference between the "old covenant" (2 Cor. 3:14)   with Israel and the new covenant is that in the new covenant God   not only sets the obligations of faith and obedience, he also   pledges to create the faith and obedience.       Notice how Hebrews 8:6b speaks of better promises: "He (Christ)   is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on   better promises." One thing that makes the promises better is that   they are promises that God will cause the elect to fulfil the   conditions of the covenant.       You can see this in verses 8-9,        In finding fault with them  (notice: the fault      lies in the people not the covenant per se, as also in Romans      8:3) , he says, Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, when      I will effect a new covenant with the house of Israel, not like      the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day when I      took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;      for they did not continue in my covenant.         So the first covenant was inferior mainly because it did not   contain a divine guarantee that it wouldn't be broken. They did   break it. But the new covenant does have a divine guarantee of   obedience. Verse 10:        For this is the covenant that I will make with the      house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my      laws into their minds, and I will write them upon their hearts      and I will be their God and they shall be my people . . .      (verse 12:) For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and I      will remember their sins no more.         What is really new about the new covenant is that Christ seals   it with his blood and purchases not only eternal life for the   covenant people but also the faith and obedience that we must have   in order to inherit eternal life. "I will put my laws into their   minds, and I will write them upon their hearts"--that is, I will   not leave it up to human initiative whether the terms of the new   covenant are fulfilled. I will cause them to be fulfilled (Ezek.   11:19-20; 36:27).       At the last supper Jesus took the cup and said, "This is my   blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the   forgiveness of sins." The "many" is the church, the new Israel,   the elect. So what happened when Jesus died was God's final,   decisive, sovereign, invincible act to create a people for   himself--not only by purchasing their forgiveness, but also by   purchasing their faith and their obedience in fulfillment of the   new covenant promises: "I will put my laws into their minds, and I   will write them in their hearts."       You and I exist as Christians because of the irresistible force   of the new covenant promises. The new covenant creates the church   and guarantees that the gates of hell will not prevail against it   and nothing will separate it from the love of God. God has given   the church to his Son as a bride by a sacred marriage oath called   the new covenant. And nothing will destroy this union.       That's the ultimate reason why it is fitting for local churches   to be formed as covenant communities--assemblies that covenant to   be the church for each other. Christ has created us by a covenant   to be his people, not just individuals, but a people--a body, a   bride--for himself. To fulfil that covenant calling demands that   we form assemblies called churches--visible churches--which in   some way make a covenant together to be the body of Christ for   each other, for the world, and for the glory of God.       One of the reasons we don't feel the necessity of a church   covenant today is because we take the existence of local churches   so for granted. There are thousands of them in the greater Twin   Cities. So we don't often ask the question: what constitutes a   visible local body of believers as a church?       But put yourself back into the early 1600's in America. As the   early Congregationalists and Baptists struggled with the formation   of new churches they wrestled with just what made a group of   people into a church. The answer given again and again was that   what made a group of persons a church was a covenant--a solemn   pledge to one another that they would believe in Christ and   worship and minister in common.       For example in 1649 in Cambridge, Massachusetts John Cotton,   Richard Mather and Ralph Patridge drew up a "model of church   government" which reasoned like this: God wills for his people to   gather in visible local churches. This is clear from the New   Testament, for example, from the letters to the seven churches of   Asia minor which were all very different (Revelation 2-3).       But, they said, this visible union cannot be established by   mere "faith," for that is invisible; nor by a "bare profession" of   faith, for that does not make a person part of one particular   church or another; nor by "cohabitation" (i.e., living in the same   community), for "atheists and Infidels may dwell together with   believers;" nor by "baptism," since baptism by itself does not   make a person a part of a particular church.       What establishes the visible union of a group of believers into   a church is that they make a covenant with each other to be the   church. This is the origin of Bethlehem's Church Covenant. It is   rooted ultimately in God's sovereign call that creates a visible   people for himself in fulfillment of the new covenant promises.   And it is rooted secondarily in the Biblical necessity of becoming   local expressions of that one global covenant people.       Bethlehem exists because of covenant commitments. First, we   exist because of God's "new covenant" commitment to forgive our   sins and to write his law on our hearts and make us his people and   be our God; and second, Bethlehem exists because of our own   "church covenant" commitment to trust Christ and worship God and   love each other in ways commanded in the New Testament.       This is what we need to understand far better than we do. This   is what we need to bring to the center of our membership process.   Reawakening of what it means to be a covenant people will go a   long way to fulfilling the longings many of us have had in recent   years to be more of what God is calling us to be. Pray with me and   study with me in these next weeks to that end.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
