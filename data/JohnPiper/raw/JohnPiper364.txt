 November 15, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       SOUND JUDGMENT, ONE BODY, SEVERAL PARTS    (Romans 12:1-8)         I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of      God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice,      acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.      And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by      the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of      God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. For      through the grace given to me I say to every man among you not      to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to      think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each      a measure of faith. For just as we have many members in one      body and all the members do not have the same function, so we,      who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members      one of another. And since we have gifts that differ according      to the grace given to us, let each exercise them accordingly;      if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; if      service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; or      he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with      liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy,      with cheerfulness.         If you were God and it was your will that your people be strong   in faith and that they become perfect in love; and if you had the   right and the power to give the gift of faith in whatever   proportion you pleased, then wouldn't you just get it done--give   everyone great faith and catapult them straight forward into   perfect love? That's what I think I would do.        To which I think God says, "That's just another reason (of   many) why you are not God." God did not do it that way. He didn't   give everyone great faith and great gifts. And it won't do to say   that the reason he doesn't do it that way is that we have   independent wills that he can't change. The text makes very clear   that God has the right and the ability to give us the level of   faith he pleases and the degree of grace he pleases and the kind   of gift he pleases. There are other reasons that he doesn't give   us all the same amount of great faith and the same degree of grace   and the same gift. I think we will see at least one of those   reasons before we're done. It has to do with the nature of the   body of Christ and the way God aims to be glorified corporately   and not just individually.        We're going to focus on verses 3-6. The main point of these   verses seems to be that each member of the body of Christ should   not think more highly of himself than is necessary, but should   think with sound judgment about his own faith and grace and gift.   That's what verse 3 says: "For through the grace given to me I say   to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he   ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as god   has allotted to each a measure of faith."        In other words, Paul is really concerned about the way we   think, or the mindset we have. This is not surprising because   verse 2 said that we should not be "conformed to this world, but   be transformed by the renewing of your mind." So verse 2 says, "Be   renewed in your mind," and then verse 3 says "Use that new mind   not to think too highly of yourself, but to have sound judgment   regarding your faith and grace and gifts."        The aim of this renewed mind and right thinking and sound   judgment is the right use of our gifts for the sake of the body of   Christ. That is, the aim is love. That's the point of verses 6-8,   "And since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given   to us, let us exercise them accordingly; if prophecy, according to   the proportion of his faith." And so on. We must think with sober   judgment about the fact that our faith comes in different   proportions if we would exercise our gifts well for the good of   the body. We must not think too highly, but think with sound   judgment about our gifts and our grace and our faith, if we are   going to use our gifts in humility and love and effectiveness for   the body.        So what I want us to focus on is this sound judgment of the   renewed mind that helps us use our gifts the way we should.        One of our goals in this series of messages on the church is to   discover what it means to be the church. Is church mainly a come   and listen series of events? Or is church mainly a meet and   minister series of gatherings. I say, "mainly" because I don't   think the answer is either-or. But I think from what we have been   seeing, and will see today that the main thing in being the church   is every member growing in the ability to minister a unique grace   to others in the body and a unique witness to those outside and a   unique tribute to God in heaven. Let's test that on today's   text.        What is this sound (or sober) judgment that we should have   about our faith and our grace and our gifts that will help us use   them for each other the way we should?        The essence of this sound judgment is that it is the opposite   of pride and that it is permeated with the awareness that our   grace and our faith and our gifts are free gifts of God and that   our differences are his doing and may never be the ground of   boasting but only of unifying service in the body. Or, to shorten   it down, sound judgment means: judgment based on God's gracious   freedom and our humility.        Paul shows this in three ways.         1. First he sets an example of this way of humble   thinking himself.         Verse 3 begins, "For through the grace given to me I say to   everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he   ought to think." Paul doesn't presume to admonish them in his own   authority. He deflects the honor that might come to him as a   person telling the whole church how to act, and says, "Through the   grace given to me I speak." Not through my own wisdom or my own   rights or my own authority. But through a special grace that God   gave me.        He does the same thing in Romans 15:15, "I have written very   boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because   of the grace that was given to me from God." His boldness to tell   the church what to think and what to do is not owing to anything   in him by nature or by his own doing. It is owing to a special   grace. Christ had freely called Paul and freely graced him to do   what Christ wanted him to do. He was acting in the authority and   power of another. So he could not think highly of himself, but   only of the wonderful grace he had received.        Now compare this testimony of Paul's to verse 6: "And since we   have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us . . ."   There you have the same phrase as in verse 3: "grace given."        Verse 3: I speak through the grace given to me.        Verse 6: Our gifts differ according to the grace given to   us.        What Paul is doing here is saying that even he, as an apostle,   is in the same class with all the other members in the church. His   gift and their gifts are owing to grace freely given by God.        This is the first thing that characterizes the renewed mind of   verse 2 and the sound judgment of verse 3: it is permeated by the   awareness that whatever God calls us to do will be based on his   grace to do it.        The effects of this mindset are at least three:        First, it gives peace of mind. Grace means that God is for us   and not against us. If you are what you are by the grace of God (1   Cor. 15:10), if you have your role in the body according to grace   then it is what's best for you and for the body. And you can rest   in God's goodness. Grace means what he gives you is good for you.   And that gives peace of mind.        The second effect of grace is that it gives humility. Grace not   only means God is for you, it also means you did not earn or   deserve what you got. It is free. That's what grace means. Romans   11:6 says, "If it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise   grace is no longer grace." Grace by definition means you didn't   earn it and therefore can't boast. The only proper response is   humility. So thinking with sound judgment means that your thinking   is permeated with this awareness: you have your role by grace, not   merit. So sound judgment is humble judgment.        The third effect of knowing that your role is a gift of grace   is the effect of power. Peace, humility and now power. The reason   is simple: God's grace is powerful. And the reason it's powerful   is because it's God's. Grace is not mere permission to serve. It   is not mere obligation to serve. It is not mere calling to serve.   Grace is power to serve. Grace is God's presence in you freeing   you from the power of sin to serve the body of Christ.        So that's the first way that Paul shows what sound judgment is   in verse 3: he sets an example of humble thinking himself by   saying that the only reason he can speak with authority is that   grace has been given to him, with its effects of peace, humility,   and power, which are all God's doing.         2. The second way Paul illustrates the humility of this   sound judgment is by saying that faith is a gift.         Verse 3: "I say to everyone of you not to think more highly of   himself than he ought to think but to think so as to have sound   judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith."        If you come to terms with the fact that God measures out faith   in various measures you will think with sound judgment and you   will not think more highly than you ought to think. Some in the   church at Rome, as in other churches then and now, were evidently   saying, "Grace may be a gift, but faith is the act of mine that   receives and uses the gift, and so I can be proud of it and think   highly of it as something to take credit for."        But Paul says, "That is not thinking with sober judgment. That   is thinking more highly than one must think." Because, even though   faith is indeed an act of the human heart, it is first a gift from   God. Verse 3: "God has measured to each a measure of faith." God   gives grace and God gives the faith to receive the grace. All   boasting is excluded. To grasp this is to be freed from thinking   more highly than we should and to think with sound judgment.        Someone might say, "Well, yes, perhaps God gives faith once at   the beginning to all his people, but the differences in our faith   are our doing alone and whether one has small faith and another   has large faith is not God's doing."        But, no, this will not stand before verse 3: " God has allotted   to each a measure of faith." Literally: "to each as God measured a   measure of faith." The clear meaning is that God measures   different measures of faith to different people. This is mentioned   in verse 6 as well when the list of gifts begins with prophecy.   Paul says, "Let each exercise &#91;his gifts&#93; accordingly: if   prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith." This is a   reference back to the measure of faith that each is given by God   (v. 3).        So the first way Paul shows us what sound judgment is is by   telling us that he and we fulfil our role in the church only by   the grace that is given to us.        Secondly he says that the differing measures of faith that we   have are owing to God's measuring out different measures of   faith.        So we cannot think more highly than is necessary because all   that we have is by grace, and even the faith to receive and use   grace is a gift. As Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:7, "What do you   have that you did not receive &#91;as a gift&#93;? And if you   &#91;thus&#93; received it, why do you boast as if it were not a   gift?"         3. Finally, Paul shows us what sound judgment is by   telling us that our gifts differ by God's design and that we   relate as parts of a body, not contestants in a game.         Verse 6 again: "Since we have gifts that differ according to   the grace given to us." Varied grace means differing gifts. And   since the gifts differ according to grace we cannot boast in them,   but only receive them and be glad and use them to serve each   other.        He puts this in the context of a body in verses 4-5, "For just   as we have many members in one body and all the members do not   have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in   Christ, and individually members one of another."        The point here is that our differing gifts and differing grace   and differing faith are supposed to be understood not as   differences among contestants in a game where we try to beat each   other, but differences among parts of a body where we try to serve   each other. That's what comes from not thinking highly of   ourselves but thinking with sober judgment--that grace and faith   and gifts are never a ground for self-exaltation but only   God-exaltation.        * * *        So go back with me for one final moment to the question we   posed at the beginning: since God has the ability and right to   give all of us the same great faith, and the same grace and the   same gifts, why does he give such a variety of measures of faith   and such a variety of grace, with some receiving less faith and   some receiving more faith?        The answer, I believe, is that God intends to create and   perfect a people for himself not ready made as immediately   perfected individuals; rather he intends to create and perfect a   people for himself by having them use their gifts toward each   other so that they join God in the process of helping each other   grow in knowledge and faith and hope and love.        It's like the rugs my wife, Noel, is crocheting. She could   take strips of cloth and lay them out straight, each the same   perfect length beside each other. Then she could glue them or   stitch them together and make a rug of equal pieces side by side   but not interwoven. But that is not the way she does it. The piece   of cloth goes in and out an up and down. It looks like it is   making some headway and then she pulls it back to pick up an   obscure almost hidden loop. The free strand stoops and bows to   pass through the almost forgotten loop and instead of going on   ahead alone, draws the loop into the pattern.        The result is that things go a lot slower than laying out the   strips and sewing them together. But the final product is a   beautifully interwoven work of art that is a greater glory because   each part didn't move quickly and immediately in a straight line   toward the ideal length, but instead in the master's hand did its   differing service of interlocking with all the other parts to   serve them.        The bottom line is that God gives some more and some less not   so that we would all move alone straight ahead toward some   imagined individualistic ideal, but so that those with more would   serve those with less and those with less would grow till they   have more and then serve the less. This way God is weaving a   tapestry that will bring him more glory than any other way.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
