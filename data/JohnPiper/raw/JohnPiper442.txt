    June 11, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Summer is for Seeing and Showing Christ   (2 Corinthians 3:12-18)          Having therefore such a hope, we usegreat boldness in our speech,    and are not as Moses, who used to put a veil over his face thatthe sons of Israel might    not look intently at the end of what was fading away. But theirminds were hardened; for    until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the sameveil remains unlifted,    because it is removed in Christ. But to this day whenever Mosesis read, a veil lies over    their heart; but whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil istaken away. Now the Lord is    the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there isliberty. But we all, with    unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the sameimage from glory to glory,    just as from the Lord, the Spirit.              Introduction: Summer And The Theme Of Love     Since February we have been talking aboutlove. Now it is summer.  And the theme of our summer together in worship is Summer isfor Seeing and Showing  Christ. But we are still on the theme of love. Why? Whatdoes love have to do with  seeing and showing Christ?     You know the answer to that. If we love eachother, and if we love our  enemies, if we love those who are hard to love, and those who dothings and believe things  that we disagree with, then people will   see   thereality of Christ in us.  They will   see   Christ and we will   show  Christ. Jesus said in  John 13:35,          By this will all men know that you are mydisciples if you have love    for one another.        If we love, we show Christ. Paul put it thisway:           We always carry about in the body thedying of Jesus, that the life    of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. (2 Cor.4:10)        He lived out the loving self-denial that Jesuslived so that people  would see the sacrificial love of Jesus in his body. Jesus said,          Let your light so shine before men, thatthey may see your good    deeds (your love) and give glory to your Father in heaven.(Matt. 5:16)        That&#146;s what summer is for. Summer is forseeing and showing Christ  through love.    Our son, Ben, called us from Georgia lastThursday. He told us about  the impact that one church&#146;s showing the love of Christ hadon him. He rides his  motor cycle to work about forty miles one way three days a week.Last week it was in the  nineties in Georgia. As he pulled into the town hot and dehydratedfrom the ride he  stopped at a stop sign. There outside the church on the cornerwere people with bright  Christian T-shirts giving away ice-cold cans of coke. He took oneand the news of that act  of kindness spread to Minneapolis in a few hours in the name ofChrist. That&#146;s what  summer is for. Summer is for seeing and showing Christ.     In the winter in Minnesota we are all surviving-- running with our  heads covered from one heated igloo to the next. In the summer, wetry to get outside. The  days are longer. The temperatures are higher. The grass and treesbeckon us with their  rich green. It is another world from January. And it isChrist&#146;s world, Christ&#146;s  summer.           Thou hast established all the boundariesof the earth;  Thou hast    made summer....  (Psalm 74:17)        So we must ask, what is   God  saying in the summer? What is  Summer saying about God? Psalm 19:1-2 answers:           The heavens are telling of the glory ofGod; and the firmament is    declaring the work of His hands. 2 Day to day pours forthspeech, and night to night    reveals knowledge.        The summer is showing the   glory ofGod  : the new angle of  the rising sun; the new night-time order of summer constellations;the creation of leaves  out of hard brown limbs; the pushing up of tulips; the snow-buriedgrass turning into soft  carpets; the return of robins and the northbound honking geese;the unfrozen lakes  mirroring the clouds; even, I dare say, the survival of mosquitoesthrough seven months of  frozen swamps, and the mice that know to leave the house and theants that come into the  house. All these things and a thousand more, if we have eyes tosee, are telling the glory  of God, and declaring the work of his hands.     For God, summer is for showing his glory, whomwe know to be Jesus  Christ, by whom all things were made, and through whom all thingshold together, and for  whom all things exist (Col. 1:16-17). He has not left himselfwithout a witness. And the  witness is mercy to a fallen world -- morning by morning, mercy inthe rain and the sun  and the upholding of the world (Acts 14:17), and the restrainingof his wrath against sin  (Romans 2:4).    So our aim is to join God in seeing and showingChrist this summer. And  all that we have studied for the last three months tells us thatshowing Christ means  showing love.           By this will all men know that you are mydisciples if you have love    for one another.        Love is not the norm in our world. It sticksout. It comes from another  world. It shows Christ.    Barnabas and I went to Subway for lunchyesterday, and as we were  leaving there were two young guys at one end of the parking lotshouting at two older guys  at the other end of the lot. They were outdoing each other withobscenities and put-downs.  It&#146;s a familiar sound in the city. And I thought, What aradically different thing it  would be if one of these guys saw Christ, and was transformed intoa man of love and came  back into that situation and walked up to one of the others andsaid, I&#146;m sorry  for the put-downs. I&#146;ve got a new thing inside. It&#146;scalled love. And now  I&#146;m  for  you and not  against  you. I&#146;d liketo get along together.  I&#146;d like to build something good together in this city. AndI&#146;d like to show you  where I got this. His name is Jesus Christ. Love is not thenorm in our society. We  need to show it. We need to show HIM.    That&#146;s what we will focus on all summer.Seeing and showing  Christ.     To Show Him We Need To See Him     The point this morning is that   toshow him we need to see him  .  And seeing him is what changes us into the kind of people thatnaturally look like him and  show him. If you want to become the kind of loving person we weretalking about last week  -- with tender affection for others -- the key is to see Christfor who he really is.    You can see this in God&#146;s own word bylooking at 2 Corinthians  3:18,           We all, with unveiled face, beholding (=seeing) as in a mirror the    glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same imagefrom glory to glory, just as    from the Lord, the Spirit.         Get the main point here and then we will try tounpack the details for  a few minutes for the sake of our summer lives.    The main point is that Christian believers arebeing transformed --  progressively, degree by degree -- into the image of Christ theLord. Be sure you see  this: We are being transformed into the same image (theLord&#146;s image) from  glory to glory (not all at once, but by degrees). Now thatmeans we are becoming  like Christ. We are growing in our capacity to show Christ bybeing like Christ. That is  God&#146;s will for us. That we be progressively conformed to theimage of Christ. And we  know that to be the image of love. Christ -- for all his toughnessand no-nonsense  life-style was a man of unsurpassed love. No one loved like Jesusloved. This was his  glory. Now Paul says, We are being transformed into the sameimage from glory to  glory.     You Become What You Behold     But this main point has another part to itin 2 Corinthians 3:18.  Paul tells us how this is happening. How are we being transformed?Suppose you are jealous  for this to happen to you. Suppose that last week, God touched you-- as he did some in an  extraordinary way -- and you long to be transformed into the kindof person who loves  other believers with authentic, tender affection. How does ithappen?    Paul says in this verse,           We all, with unveiled face  beholdingas in a mirror the glory of    the Lord , are being transformed into the same image fromglory to glory, just as from    the Lord, the Spirit.        The key, Paul says, is that we behold(see) the glory of the  Lord. In other words we are transformed into his image bylooking at his glory. You  become like what you constantly behold.     In the five or ten year after I left Fullerseminary people would see  me teach who knew Dr. Daniel Fuller and they would laugh at howmany of his mannerisms I  had absorbed. The reason? He was my hero. I loved his wisdom andhis pedagogy and his  spirit of humble teachableness. I was with him a lot and I lookedand listened.  Unwittingly I started to sound like him and move my hands like himand think like him and  ask questions like him.    Now Paul says, when you behold as in amirror the glory of the  Lord, you will be transformed into his likeness, from one degreeof glory to  another.     So if we want to show Christ this summer sothat people can see him in  us, our strategy must be to see him. To see him for who he reallyis. To fix our gaze on  him and look to him and think about him, and put him before usagain and again. This is  the key to becoming like him. Seeing is the key to showing.     Showing Christ: Slave Labor vs. The FreedomOf Love     Without this seeing, the burden to show himbecomes slave labor.  Let me try to show you this from the other words in the verse andthe context. Let me see  if I can simplify these verses about Moses and the veil and so onin verses 12-17.     In verse 13 Paul points out that back in theOld Testament when God  communicated his will with Moses on Mount Sinai, Moses&#146; faceshown with a reflection  of the glory of God, and he would put a veil on his face so thatthe people wouldn&#146;t  see the glory fade away. Then he interprets this as a picture ofthe hardness of the minds  of the people: Their minds were hardened (v. 14). Andhe compares it to the  fact that there is still a veil between the people&#146;s mindsand the true meaning of  the law of God in Scripture. Verse 14b: Until this very dayat the reading of the  old covenant the same veil remains unlifted. In other wordsthe true meaning of the  law is veiled to the minds of the Jewish people (and Gentiles!)--until they turn to the  Messiah. Verse 14c: Because [the veil] is removed inChrist. Verse 16:  Whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil is takenaway. In other words, in  Christ the mind is freed to see the true meaning of the OldTestament law. The veil of  hardness is removed.    Now verse 17 gives an explanation of why thatis. Why is it that when  you turn to the Lord Jesus the veil of misunderstanding is takenaway? Verse 17: Because  the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there  is  liberty. I think what he means is this: what the people saw,by and large, as they  looked through this veil was a kind of law that enslaved themrather than freeing them.  They interpreted the law as commandments of God loaded on themfrom outside without any  spiritual, transforming power inside of them to give them thedesire to do the  commandments. And that&#146;s the meaning of slavery. Slavery iswhen you get commandments  from outside that you don&#146;t want to do on the inside. Theresult is either rebellion  or legalism. You can say, I reject the burden of yourcommandments. Or you can  say, I will try to measure up with externalcompliance, when inside there is  no real delight in the commandments -- no real &#145;wantto.&#146; That is slavery.    And the antidote to that kind of slavery is theinternal transforming  power of the Holy Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord isthere is freedom.  This is what the new covenant is all about -- the enabling powerof the Holy Spirit  transforming us from the inside out so that we love the law ofGod. So Paul says in verse  17 that the reason this enslaving veil is taken away when we turnto the Lord is that  the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord isthere is freedom.  The reason the Spirit gives freedom is that the Spirit givesinternal transformation that  gives us the desires to do what God wills for us to do. Freedom iswanting to do what you  are commanded by God to do. God says, Love! The fruitof the Spirit is love.  Therefore, where the Spirit is, there is freedom.    Now what does that have to do with what we sawin verse 18 -- seeing  and showing Christ? Well verse 18 ends with the words, Justas from the Lord, the  Spirit. In other words, the our being transformed from gloryto glory is from  the Lord -- he is the one working the change in us, as welook to him. How is he  doing it? He is the Spirit. The Lord and the Spirit are one. TheHoly Spirit is the Spirit  of Jesus and he is working this transformation in us.    But what&#146;s important for us to see is theWAY he is doing this. I  want to be free this summer, don&#146;t you? I don&#146;t want tobe enslaved. I  don&#146;t want to live under the burden of being told to dothings I don&#146;t have any  desire to do. But I don&#146;t want to turn away from God and makemy deceitful desires  the center of the universe. That would be the worst kind ofslavery, in the disguise of  freedom. What I want is for my desires to be so transformed by theSpirit of the Lord that  when God commands me to do something, my whole heart says,YES, Lord!    How shall that happen? It will happen, as verse18 says, by steadily  looking to Jesus, the Lord. The Holy Spirit -- the Spirit of theLord -- has one main  task, to glorify Jesus (John 16:14). To help us see him and showhim. Therefore when we  turn to the Lord and set our hearts on Jesus, the Spirit works tohelp us see him. He  opens the eyes of our hearts to apprehend and appreciate and savorand cherish and  treasure the glory of the Lord. And then by that means he changesour inner drives and  desires and longings so that we want what Jesus wants, and arefree.    When Jesus says, love your enemy, we are freebecause the Spirit is  working this very love in our hearts as you look to Jesus. When hesays love your neighbor  as you love yourself, we are free, because the Spirit is workingin us this very love as  we look to Jesus. The fruit of the Spirit is love. When he says,love one another with  tender, family affection, we are free because, even though thisdoes not lie in our power  to do, we can, degree by degree, grow into this freely, becausewhere the Spirit of the  Lord is there is freedom. He is in us awakening those veryaffections as we steadfastly  look to Jesus.    The Spirit is not working this transformationin us without reference  to Jesus. Not while we watch endless hours of empty, trifling TV;not while we dribble our  hours away aimlessly exploring the World Wide Web; not while weset our minds on things  that ignore Christ. No. The Spirit moves and works and frees in avery definite  atmosphere, namely, where we are beholding as in a mirrorthe glory of the Lord  Jesus (v. 18). The Spirit exalts Christ. The Spirit opensthe eyes to Christ. The  Spirit applies the image of Christ to or soul. If we choose not tofocus on Christ, if we  go our own way and preoccupy ourselves with other focuses in life,then let us not say,  Where is God? when we bear the painful fruit of ourbondage to sin; and  experience the law of God as a burden rather than a joy. He hastold us the path of  freedom. If we spend our days and evenings looking elsewhere wewill probably stay bound  up in all our enslavements.     Conclusion     The longing of our hearts is that the HolySpirit would come in  power among us this summer; liberating power. This is calledrevival. And this is why we  are meeting tonight and the alternate Sunday nights this summer at7:00 (not 6:00) for  worship and the word and witness and prayer. God is moving allover the world in  remarkable ways. We want his fullness. We want his freedom.Tonight I will share with you  some of the ways I see the need for revival. Our strategy issimple: set our focus and our  affections on Jesus; behold him. Summer is for seeing Christ. Thisis where the Spirit  moves. This is freedom. And the freedom of love will show Christwith power to the world.  I pray that God will give you a deep longing for this.    There are so many things we need deliverancefrom. I will mention some  of them tonight. In twelve weeks may it not be said in our midst,Harvest is past,  summer is ended, and we are not saved. But rather may it besaid, He has come  to us like the summer rain watering the earth and givinglife.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
