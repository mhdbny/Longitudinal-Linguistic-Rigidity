  January 12, l986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning  John Piper, Pastor Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   "MY PRAYER TO GOD  IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVED"    (Romans 10:1) "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they mightbe saved."    Even though the apostle Paul said in Philippians 3:12, "Not that I have already  obtained, nor am already perfect," nevertheless he said in Philippians 4:9,  "What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, do; and the  God of peace will be with you."     In other words, even though he was not sinlessly perfect, yet he pointed  people to his heart and life as a guide for obedience. When he sets his attitudes  and behaviors before us in his teachings the point is that we should copy  them. They are the word of God to us just as much as his doctrinal sentences.     Therefore, when he says in Romans 10:1, "Brethren, my heart's desire and  prayer to God for them is that they might be saved," he means, "Be like this.  Have a heart like mine."     So last week we focussed on the first half of the verse, "My heart's desire  is that they might be saved." And this week we will focus on the second half,  "My prayer to God for them is that they might be saved."     "They" refers to Israel, his kinsmen, the chosen people of God. Now what  do we learn from the fact that Paul is praying for Israel? I'll just mention  three things. We learn that his prayer is 1) a global prayer, 2) an individual  prayer, and 3) a prayer for God's effectual saving work.        1. A Global Prayer     To see this we need to look at the role of Israel in redemptive history described  in chapter 11. First, look at 11:25-26, "Lest you be wise in your own conceits,  I want you to understand this mystery, brethren: a hardening has come upon  part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles come in, and so all  Israel will be saved."     What we see here is this: when God looked down on the disobedient nations  in Genesis 11, his choice was to call out for himself one man, Abraham, and  build a people for himself through that one man. He gave them promises and  covenants and revelations of his glory and revelations of his will and a  way of forgiveness in the sacrifices; and eventually gave them the Messiah,  Jesus Christ.     But by and large the people were rebellious, and only a remnant trusted the  promises of God and lived the obedience of faith. And so when the Messiah  was rejected the gospel spilled over the banks of Israel to bless the world  of the gentiles. Now, Paul says, a hardening has come upon the greater part  of Israel until the full number of the gentiles come in. That is, God has  abandoned Israel in her sin for a season. And his purpose is to gather his  people from every tongue and tribe and people and nation until the full number  of the elect are saved.     But then, when the Great Commission reaches its fulfillment, the Spirit of  God will remove the hardness from Israel and a great awakening will occur  and in Israel and the nation as a whole will turn to Christ and be saved.     You can see this plan of God in verses 30-31, "Just as you (Gentiles) were  once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their (Israel's)  disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy  shown to you they also may receive mercy."     This is the same strange pattern of salvation we saw in 11:25-26. First,  the Gentiles are disobedient. Then, through the disobedience of Israel, the  Gentiles receive mercy. That is, a hardening has come upon Israel until the  Gentiles are mercifully gathered in. That is verse 30. But now verse 31 completes  the plan of God. The ultimate reason Israel was disobedient was that mercy  might reach beyond them to the Gentiles and in this way Israel also might  receive mercy and be saved.     You can see this pattern of redemption again in 11:11-12, 15. But let this  suffice for us now to make the point that Paul's prayer was a global prayer.  In what sense was it a global prayer?     It was global in the sense that it must have included the full number of  the Gentiles which would come in through the fulfillment of the great commission.  How could he pray for the salvation of Israel when he teaches that a hardening  has come upon most of Israel until the full number of the Gentiles come in?  The answer must be that his prayer included the ingathering of the full number  of the Gentiles.     When my wife is away from town and I pray that she enjoy with us a special  supper in the evening, I am also praying that she have a safe trip home.  It is necessarily included in my prayer that she be with us for supper. So  when Paul prays for the conversion of Israel he is also praying for the  ingathering of the full number of the Gentiles. He is praying for the completion  of the great commission. It is a global prayer.        2. An Individual Prayer     Paul's prayer was not only for the corporate conversion of all Israel in  the future, it was also a prayer for individual Jews through his own ministry.  Look at Romans 11:13-14, "Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then  as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order to make  may fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.     Paul not only banked on the conversion of "all Israel" after the full number  of the Gentiles comes in (11:26); he also strove for the salvation of "some"  Israelites through his own ministry. The way he did it was to lavish Jewish  privileges on the Gentiles. That is, he told them that they could become  heirs of Abraham (Galatians 3:14,29) and "true Jews" (Romans 2:29) just by  believing in Jesus who was the seed of Abraham.     His aim in this was to make Israelites jealous. He wanted them to see Gentiles  enjoying hope and forgiveness and a life changing relationship with the God  of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And he hoped that this would help them see  that faith and not works really was the way to fulfill the law. Which would  then lead them to repent and believe and be saved.     And my inference from this strategic effort to win some Israelites, is that  Paul surely prayed for the conversion of these Jews. He no doubt said as  he entered a synagogue to preach, "Sovereign Lord, be pleased to overcome  the hardness of heart for some of these Israelites in this synagogue. Open  their hearts that they might give heed to the gospel and be saved." Which  leads to the third lesson from Paul's praying for Israel.        3. A Prayer for God's Effectual Saving Work.     Paul prays for God to actually save Israel. That is, Paul does not pray for  God just to make them able to save themselves. He prays for their salvation  not for their savability.     Here's what I mean. If you believe that God has the right and power to raise  the spiritually dead and to grant repentance to the disobedient and have  mercy on whom he will have mercy, then you pray that God will do that. You  ask God to actually save them -- pull them up from the bottom of the lake,  slide their limp bodies over the edge of the boat, and to do what ever he  has to do to make them alive spiritually.     But if you believe that God does not have this right but that man has the  right of final self-determination -- that man is deciding who and how many  will inhabit God's final kingdom -- then you will not be able to ask God  to actually save anybody.     You cannot pray, "God, take out their heart of stone and give them a new  heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 11:19).     You can't pray, "Lord, circumcise their heart so that they love you" (Deuteronomy  30:6).     You can't pray, "Father, put your Spirit within them and cause them to walk  in your statutes" (Ezekiel 36:27).     You can't pray, "Lord, grant them repentance and a knowledge of the truth"  (2 Timothy 2:25-26).     You can't pray, "Open their eyes so that they believe to the Gospel" (Acts  16:14).     The reason you can't is that all these prayers give God a right that you  have reserved for man -- namely the ultimate, decisive determination of his  destiny. If you ask God to do any of these things, He would be the one who  actually saves.     How then do you pray if you really believe that man and not God must make  the ultimate decisions about salvation in the universe. A good example is  Dick Eastman's book, THE HOUR THAT CHANGES THE WORLD. He believes that the  ultimate self-determining power of man must be preserved when we pray to  God. How? At the end of his book in a section called "How to Pray for the  Lost" (pp. 157-161), he says that what we should do is ask God to cause people  to ask six crucial questions. (Whom can I trust? What is my purpose? When  will I really be free? Why do people hate religion? How can I cope? Where  will I go when I die?)     For example, he says, "Ask God to cause a specific person...to begin questioning  whom they can really trust in life." But my question then is: Why is right  for God to cause a person to think a question and wrong for God to cause  that person to think an answer? Why is it legitimate for God to take control  of a man to the degree that He cause the man to ask a question he would not  have otherwise asked, but it is not legitimate for God to exert that same  influence to cause the man to give an answer that he would not otherwise  have given -- namely that Jesus should be trusted?     Even more telling is this suggestion Eastman suggests: "Pray that God will  plant in the hearts of these people...an inner unrest, together with a longing  to know the 'Truth.'" My question is, If it is legitimate for God to "plant  a longing" in a person's heart, how strong can the longing be that God chooses  to plant?     There are two kinds of longings God could plant in an unbeliever's heart.  One is so strong that it leads the person to pursue and embrace Christ. The  other is not strong enough to lead a person to embrace Christ. Which do you  pray for? If you pray for the strong longing, then you are praying that the  Lord work effectually and get that person saved. If you pray for the weak  longing, then you are praying for an ineffectual longing that leaves the  person in sin (but preserves his self-determination.)      Top      Do you see where this leads? People who really believe that man must have  the ultimate power of self-determination, can't consistently pray that God  would convert sinners. Why? Because if they pray for divine influence in  a sinner's life they are either praying for an successful influence (which  takes away the sinner's ultimate self-determination), or they are praying  for an unsuccessful influence, (which is not praying for conversion). So  either you give up praying for conversion or you give up ultimate human  self-determination.     Paul leaves no doubt where he stands on that issue in Romans 9:16, "It depends  not upon man's will or exertion, but upon God's mercy." So he prays that  God would convert Israel! He prays for her salvation! He does not pray for  ineffectual influences, but for effectual influences. And that is how we  should pray too.     We should take the new covenant promises of God and plead with God to bring  them to pass in Israel and in the the full number of the Gentiles and especially  in the individuals in our own circle of acquaintance.     "God, take out of their flesh the heart of stone and give them a new heart  flesh" (Ezekiel 11:19).     "Lord, circumcise their heart so that they love you" (Deuteronomy 30:6).     "Father, put your Spirit within them and cause them to walk in your statutes"  (Ezekiel 36:27).     "Lord, grant them repentance and a knowledge of the truth that they may escape  from the snare of the devil" (2 Timothy 2:25-26).     "Father, open their eyes so that they believe to the Gospel" (Acts 16:14).     "God, crucify the mind of the flesh that is unwilling to submit to your law  that the mind of the Spirit might rule unto life" (Romans 8:7-8).     In other words, we should say, "Father, my heart's desire and prayer to you  is that you would SAVE them."     Let me draw these points together and to a close by issuing a challenge to  you with the encouragement of what God is doing today in the Christian movement  world-wide and at Bethlehem.     It seems to me that the Spirit of God is moving in our generation in an unusual  way. David Bryant calls those who study awakenings and revivals spiritual  seismologists. They try to read the spiritual tremors of Christianity to  detect if an earthquake of awakening and missions is on the way.     And there are undeniable tremors that should encourage all of us that God  is on the move. Let me mention a few.     1. At Urbana 1984 83% of the students made some kind of commitment to missions.  That was twice the response of three years earlier. Why?     2. In 1960 there were 16,000 protestant career missionaries from North America.  Today (25 years later) the figure is over 30,000. The four largest evangelical  mission agencies have grown from 2,800 to 14,000 in the same period. Why?     3. Many of the non-western receiving nations have now become sending countries.  By the year 2000 half the missionary force will be from these countries.  Why?     4. Some brand new mission agencies are growing at phenomenal rates. Two years  ago Frontiers sent out its first 20 people. Today there are 103 on the field  and 600 wait in line to be appointed or accepted. Why.     5. Enrollment at evangelical missions institutions has jumped dramatically  in the last ten years. In five well known schools the enrollment jumped from  less than 400 in 1975 to over 1,200 today. Why?     6. In 1963 only 600 people participated in a short term missions project.  For the past two years the average has been about 30,000 a year in short  term missions work. Why?     7. In South Korea almost a third of the population is evangelical. Seoul  is the home of over 6,000 churches, and the biggest Methodist, Presbyterian  and Pentecostal churches in the world are there. Why?     8. Under the oppression of Communism the Christian community in China grew  from one million in 1949 to over 30 million today. Why?     9. The insight that there are 17,000 unreached people groups has gripped  most mission agencies in the past ten years and fired the imagination of  the new generation with the slogan, "A church for every people by the year  2000" (Not the old SVM slogan: "The evangelization of the world in our  generation"). Why?     10. The movement has received continual impulses by the establishment of  the U.S. Center for World Mission with its satellites and clones. Why?     The global list could go on and on. I think the evidence suffices to show  that there are tremors of something wonderful in the wings. In any case,  the Spirit is moving in remarkable ways around the world. Why?     Before I suggest an answer lets look at Bethlehem's little tremors too. We  have not had an earthquake of awakening or any remarkable harvest. But steadily  the tremors increase. Just to mention a few from 1985:     1. The ministry of prayer has persevered and grown. There is an ongoing team,  a prayer room, prayer during services, prayer every day at 7AM; and last  Friday we were up another 50% over last years all night prayer meeting (150-175).  Prayer pervades the ministries of the church. And it seems to be increasing  steadily from year to year.     2. The International Students ministry flourished with outstanding retreats  and the renting of the International House.     3. Instead of sending out the 15 we anticipated under the auspices of 90  by '90 we sent out 21.     4. The monthly Frontier Fellowship was established on the last Wednesday  of each month.     5. Noel and I were given the privilege to leave the church for six weeks  to minister in Liberia and Cameroon.     6. Steve and Susan felt the call to take a leave of absence and teach for  a year in Cameroon beginning this August.     7. The Perspectives class was offered again on Monday evenings with over  80 enrolled from around the Cities.     8. I was elected to the Foreign Mission Board of the Baptist General Conference,  which I mention because of the impact it will have on our church and because  it is a sign that our church is viewed as a hopeful sign in missions.     9. Our worship attendance last fall was about 20% greater than the preceeding  fall.     10. God put it in your hearts to meet the 1985 budget even though it was  a 35% increase over the previous year.     And this list could go on and on too. But what's the point of all this. The  point is that God is magnifying himself in answering the prayers of his people.  A. T. Pierson said, "There has never been a spiritual awakening in any country  or locality that did not begin in united prayer." And J. Edwin Orr said,  "History is full of exciting results as God has worked through concerted,  united, sustained prayer."     We could show this from the early church in Acts. We could show it in the  Protestant Reformation, and the Moravian missions advance, the Great evangelical  awakenings of the 18th and 19th centuries.     And so my challenge to you today is to be a part of something very great  that God is doing by prayer. Pray globally for the ingathering of the full  number of the Gentiles and for the conversion of all Israel, and the consummation  of the age. Your prayers will not be wasted. They will be stored up in the  bottles of heaven and poured out in due time upon the church and the nations  and Israel.     And pray for Bethlehem, that the tremors might become a full scale earthquake  of revival with an unprecedented impact for Christ on this city as the harvest  comes.     And pray for the salvation of individuals without ceasing and without growing  weary. Make a list and be faithful for years. I close with a testimony from  George Muller of Bristol.     I am now, in 1864, waiting upon God for certain blessings, for which I have  daily besought Him for 19 years and 6 months, without one day's intermission.  Still the full answer is not yet given concerning the conversion of certain  individuals. In the meantime, I have received many thousands of answers to  prayer. I have also prayed daily, without intermission, for the conversion  of other individuals about ten years, for other six or seven years, for others  four, three, and two years, for others about eighteen months; and still the  answer is not yet granted, concerning these persons [whom I have prayed for  for nineteen years and six months]... Yet I am daily continuing in prayer  and expecting the answer...Be encouraged, dear Christian reader, with fresh  earnestness to give yourself to prayer, if you can only be sure that you  ask for things which are for the glory of God.
