   December 22,1996 Bethlehem Baptist Church John Piper, Pastor      Jesus:Mediator of a Better Covenant  
 (pt.2)   Hebrews 8:6-13      But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as Heis also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted onbetter promises. 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless,there would have been no occasion sought for a second. 8 For findingfault with them, He says, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,when I will effect a new covenant with the house of Israel and withthe house of Judah; 9 not like the covenant which I made with theirfathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out ofthe land of Egypt; for they did not continue in my covenant, and Idid not care for them, says the Lord. 10 For this is the covenantthat I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says theLord: I will put my laws into their minds, and I will write them upontheir hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.11 And they shall not teach everyone his fellow citizen, and everyonehis brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all shall know me, from theleast to the greatest of them. 12 For I will be merciful to theiriniquities, and I will remember their sins no more." 13 When He said,"A new covenant," He has made the first obsolete. But whatever isbecoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.     A Threatening Prediction    For those who had ears to hearthere was a threatening prediction behind Hebrews 8:13. It would nothave seemed threatening to everyone, but to many it would have and itdid. The writer interprets the word “new,” in the phrase “newcovenant” from Jeremiah 31, like this: “When He said, ‘A   new          covenant,’ He has made the firstobsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is readyto disappear.” What does he have in mind? This old covenant is “readyto disappear”? For those whose whole way of life was defined by this“first” covenant, this predicted disappearance would have beenthreatening.    Let me give you a backgroundthat will help you hear this the way I think he meant it to beheard.    It is almost impossible toexaggerate the importance of what happened in A. D. 70 in Jerusalem.It was an event that, for Jews and Christians, was critical indefining their faith for the next 2,000 years. God had been at workfor 2,000 years since Abraham, calling, preserving, judging,forgiving and blessing his people Israel. He had commanded anelaborate system of sacrifices and priestly ministries and feasts andrituals to define Israel among the nations and to make himself knownto them and to point them to the future fulfillment.     Christianity Threatened theJewish Way of Life    Now Christians claimed that theMessiah had come, Jesus of Nazareth. The great mass of Israelrejected this claim. The rejection resulted in the crucifixion ofJesus and the persecution of the early Christians. The claims of theChristians raised a huge question for the Jewish people as a whole.What would become of their way of life? The new faith seemedincredibly radical. For example, in Acts 6 Stephen is proving to bean irresistible witness for the truth of the Christian faith. To stophim, false witnesses are brought in. And what is their charge? Acts6:13-14:    They put forward falsewitnesses who said, "This man incessantly speaks against this holyplace, and the Law; for we have heard him say that this Nazarene,Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moseshanded down to us."    There you have the meaning ofChristianity for the Jewish leaders. It meant the destruction of theold ways. The “vanishing” of the first covenant. They could sense it.He speaks against this place (Jerusalem) and the Law; and they reallybelieved that Christianity threatened the existence of the Templeitself. And if the Temple falls, then what will become of all the“customs” of the Old Testament and the whole religious life ofJudaism? The issue was so sharp they killed Stephen over it.    And they did indeed have reasonto be afraid. Not only had Jesus actually said that the Temple wouldbe destroyed, he had predicted the entire destruction of Jerusalem.For example, in Luke 19:43-44 he said,    The days shall come upon youwhen your enemies will throw up a bank before you, and surround you,and hem you in on every side, and will level you to the ground andyour children within you, and they will not leave in you one stoneupon another, because you did not recognize the time of yourvisitation.    In other words, the Jewishpeople had reason to fear these early Christians. Even though theywere a meek and peaceful band that would rather die than live by thesword, nevertheless at the very heart of their faith was the implicitend of the Jewish way of life as they knew it. So much so that theend of that way of life (not by Christian violence, but by God’shand) would be a partial vindication of the Christian’s claim totruth.     The Roman Destruction ofJerusalem    For decades before and afterthe birth of Jesus the atmosphere in the land of Israel was tensewith the spirit of rebellion against Rome. The Jewish people chafedunder this godless power, and dreamed of deliverance. In September A.D. 66, Florus, the Roman governor of Judea, provoked the Jews byraiding the Temple treasury and taking what he thought the Jews werewithholding in taxes.    This provoked a riot, and heruthlessly crucified some of the citizens and allowed his troops toplunder part of the city. This enraged the people. Eleazar, theJewish Captain of the Temple, persuaded the priests no longer tooffer daily sacrifices for the welfare of the Roman emperor. This wasan ominous sign of open revolt against Rome by a tiny vassalnation.    In a surge of courage andfolly, the Jewish forces stormed the fortress of Antonius in the cityand took it and wiped out the Roman soldiers. So the die was cast,and there was no turning back. Vespasian, the Roman general, came toput down the revolt in 67 and took all of Israel except Jerusalem. Hereturned to Rome to become emperor and left the finishing of the workto his son, the general Titus. After a five-month siege, he brokethrough and burned the Temple to the ground in August of 70. A fewJewish groups held out for a while, but all eventually collapsed,including the force at Masada, who committed mass suicide in 73rather than be handed over as captives.     The End of Judaism as itWas    That was the end of Judaism asit had been known for hundreds of years. The priesthood was at anend. The animal sacrifices were at an end. The worship life thatcentered on Jerusalem and the Temple was at an end. And it has neverbeen restored to our own day. Judaism as we know it today inMinneapolis and New York and Tel Aviv is not the same way of lifepracticed before AD 70.    What is the meaning of thiscataclysmic event for Judaism?    It was a witness to the truthof Christianity. Jesus predicted it. And it came to pass. Christiansdid not fight against Israel in this revolt. In fact, Christianssuffered in Jerusalem    with    Israel because of the revolt. As far asRome was concerned Judaism was the tree and Christianity was thebranch. If they could destroy the tree of Judaism, they could wipeout Christianity as well. Jews and Christians suffered together in AD70.    So the destruction of AD 70 wasnot an act of anti-Semitism. Rather it was an act of divine judgment.That is what Jesus says in Luke 19:43-44: these things happened“because you did not recognize the time of your visitation,” -- thatis, you did not recognize the coming of the Messiah. It was God’stestimony that the coming of Jesus was in fact what the book ofHebrews says it was -- the replacement of shadows with Reality --Christ himself.    One of the early churchfathers, Athenasius (born A. D. 373), put it like this,    It is a sign, and an importantproof, of the coming of the Word of God, that Jerusalem no longerstands. . . . For . . . when the truth was there, what need any moreof the shadow? And this was why Jerusalem stood till then -- namely,that [the Jews] might be exercised in the types as a preparation forthe reality.*    In other words, one might say,the destruction of the Temple and of Jerusalem was God’s way ofsaying: “   Wake up to themeaning of the book of Hebrews in the New Testament   .”    Now we come back to Hebrews8:13 with a new sense of what was at stake in these words: “When Hesaid [in Jeremiah 31:31], ‘A new covenant,’ He has made the firstobsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is readyto disappear.”     Christmas Means TwoThings    What we saw in the last twoSundays looking at Hebrews 8 is that Christmas means twothings.    1) It means the replacement ofOld Testament shadows with reality. The temple and tabernacle andsacrifices and priesthood and feasts and dietary laws were allshadows and copies of the Reality in heaven, namely, Jesus Christ andhis work as our High Priest and our Sacrifice and our focus ofworship. Jesus fulfills and replaces the shadows of the OldTestament.    2) And the second meaning ofChristmas that we saw in this chapter is that God makes the Realityof Christ real to us personally by the work of the new covenant whenhe writes the will of God on our hearts (v. 10).    So Christmas means shadows arereplaced with Reality: Old Testament copies give way to the Original,Jesus Christ. And it means that God goes beyond that, and movespowerfully into our hearts and minds to overcome our resistance tothis Reality. He writes the will of God -- the truth of the Realityof Jesus (2 Corinthians 4:4, 6) -- on our hearts, so that we arewilling and eager to trust him and follow him -- from the inside outfreely, not under constraint from rules outside.     A Third Meaning -- God isMerciful    Before we connect these twomeanings of Christmas with Hebrews 8:13 and the destruction ofJerusalem, let’s add one more from verse 12: “For I will be mercifulto their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.” This isthe end of the quote from Jeremiah 31. It begins with “for” or“because.” So it is the ground or basis for the other promises of thenew covenant (in verses 10-11).    God said, I will write the mywill on your hearts, and be your God, and cause you to know mepersonally . . .   For    I will be merciful to your iniquitiesand remember your sins no more.” In other words, the death of Jesusfor our sins is the foundation of the new covenant (Hebrews 7:27;9:28; 10:12). It’s the basis of the other promises. If Christ had notdied for our sins, God could not be our God or write the law on ourhearts or cause us to know him personally. All that mercy wasobtained by the blood of Jesus. This is why Jesus called the cup ofthe Lord’s supper, “the new covenant    in my blood   ” (Luke 22:20).    Here’s what the writer wants usto understand. God is just and holy and separated from sinners likeus. No fingerpointing here -- like    us   ! This is our main problem at Christmasand every other season. How shall we get right with a just and holyGod? Nevertheless God is merciful and has promised in Jeremiah 31(five hundred years before Christ) that someday he would do somethingnew. He would replace shadows with the Reality of the Messiah. And hewould powerfully move into our lives and write his will on our heartsso that we are not constrained from outside but are willing frominside to love him and trust him and follow him.     A Christmas Gift Worth SingingAbout!    That would be the greatestsalvation imaginable -- if God should offer us the greatest Realityin the universe to enjoy and then move in us to see to it that wecould enjoy it with the greatest freedom and joy possible. That wouldbe a Christmas gift worth singing about.    That is, in fact, what hepromised. But there was a huge obstacle. Our sin. Our separation fromGod because of our unrighteousness. How shall a holy and just Godtreat us sinners with so much kindness as to give us the greatestReality in the universe (his Son) to enjoy with the greatest joypossible? The answer is that God put our sins on his Son, and judgedthem there, so that he could put them out of his mind, and deal withus mercifully and remain just and holy at the same time. Hebrews 9:28says, “Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many.”    This is what verse 12 means:Christ bore our sins in his own body when he died. He took ourjudgment. He canceled our guilt. And that means the sins are gone.They do not remain in God’s mind as a basis for condemnation. In thatsense he “forgets” them. They are consumed in the death ofChrist.    Which means that God is nowfree, in his justice, to lavish us with the new covenant. He gives usChrist, the greatest Reality in the universe, for our enjoyment. Andhe writes his own will -- his own heart -- on our hearts so that wecan love Christ and trust Christ and follow Christ from the insideout, with freedom and joy.     Jesus Christ is the Goal, theReality    When Jerusalem fell to theRomans in A. D. 70, and the Temple was burned, and the sacrificesstopped being offered in Judaism, and the Levitical priesthood cameto and end, God was saying with his power and providence: Christ wasthe goal of it all. Christ was the Reality; the rest was shadows.Christianity is a faith woven into history. It is not a mere set ofideas. It is about a person, Jesus, who came into history and diedand rose again. And it is about a God who intervenes in history tobear witness to the reality of his Son, Jesus Christ.    And look around today. Is itnot astonishing that God has preserved the Jewish people to this day.And there is yet a future for them in Christ according to Scripture.But what do we see? Are they meeting at the Temple? Are they offeringanimal sacrifices? Do they look to the Levitical priesthood for theirmediation with God? No. Why? Because Jesus said, “they did notrecognize the time of their visitation” (Luke 19:44). The existenceof the Jewish people today and the transformed version of Judaismthat they follow is a constant witness to the world that the firstcovenant is vanishing away. That the Messiah, Jesus Christ, has come.That he has inaugurated the new covenant. That the shadows have beenreplaced by Reality. And that the Spirit has written the will of Godon our hearts.    So let us look to the greatfinal reality of Christ, and put our hope in him, and love him andworship this Christmas.    COPYRIGHT 1996 John Piper
