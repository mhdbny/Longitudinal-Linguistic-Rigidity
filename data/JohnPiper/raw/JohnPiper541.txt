 November 29, 1998    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        THE FINAL DIVIDE: ETERNAL LIFE OR ETERNAL WRATH    (Romans 2:6-10)        Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes   judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn   yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. 2 And we   know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who   practice such things. 3 But do you suppose this, O man, when you   pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same   yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God? 4 Or do you   think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and   patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to   repentance? 5 But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant   heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath   and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 6 who will render   to each person according to his deeds: 7 to those who by   perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and   immortality, eternal life; 8 but to those who are selfishly   ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,   wrath and indignation. 9 There will be tribulation and distress   for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of   the Greek, 10 but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does   good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.        Either Heaven or Hell Awaits        Whatever else this text teaches - and it teaches many things -   one thing is abundantly clear and immeasurably important for us   and for our mission in this modern, secular world: namely, when   your life is over on this earth, and this present age is over on   this planet, God will give you either eternal life or wrath and   indignation. You will receive either glory and honor and peace or   you will receive tribulation and distress. Heaven or hell awaits   you when you die. And both will last forever.        Let's make sure we see this fundamental reality in this text.   Verse 6: "God will render to each person according to his deeds:   &#91;7&#93; to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for   glory and honor and immortality, &#91;he will render&#93; eternal   life; &#91;8&#93; but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do   not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, &#91;he will   render&#93; wrath and indignation. &#91;Now he reverses the order   and gives the same alternatives again, lest we miss the   point.&#93; &#91;9&#93; There will be tribulation and distress   &#91;corresponding to verse 8: "wrath and indignation"&#93; for   every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the   Greek, &#91;10&#93; but glory and honor and peace   &#91;corresponding to verse 7: "eternal life"&#93; to everyone who   does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."        So, whatever else you see here, please don't miss this. What   could be more important or more relevant or more urgent or more   immense or more captivating than your happiness or misery for all   eternity?        For all Stages of Life        Children, this is very important for you. Someday you are going   to die. I hope it will be when you are very old and full of years.   But you might be six or sixteen when you die. And when you die,   you will either enter eternal life with God or go away under his   eternal anger and misery forever. You don't have to be afraid   about this. God has given his Son, Jesus, to die for sinners so   that everyone who trusts in him will not go to hell, but have   eternal life (John 3:16). But you do need to care about this. So   listen carefully today and ask your daddy or mommy to help you be   sure that you will go to heaven and not to hell.        And teenagers, be wise and set your minds to think about what   really matters in this world. Don't be foolish and give your best   energies to things that last a moment and then are gone. Don't   think that you will live a long time and deal with heaven and hell   when you are old. Every day the news carries stories about   teenagers dying suddenly. And if you put it off, what you may find   is that your heart is so infused with the mindset of this world   that you are no longer able to feel a serious spiritual affection.   O how many times I heard my father say the ominous words of   Ecclesiastes 12:1, "Remember also your Creator in the days of your   youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when   you will say, 'I have no pleasure in them.'" Few things are more   to be feared than a godless, miserable old age unable to delight   in heaven or fear hell. Do not presume that you will get serious   about eternity when you are old. Do it now.        And all you married couples and single people in the prime of   your life, beware of being swept into the all-consuming demands of   your careers only to find yourselves gasping for some fun and   entertainment on the weekend, finding your relief from worldly   work in worldly fun. And waking - perhaps - someday to realize you   have no taste for things of God. You have become a connoisseur of   restaurants, and videos, and movies, and sports, and stocks, and   computers, and a hundred transient things. And all the while, your   sense of heaven and of hell has died. Wake up before it is too   late. And tremble at these things today. And set your minds to   think about the biggest issues in the universe: eternal life or   wrath.        And all you older saints (or maybe some who are not saved),   don't hide from this fast-approaching, all-important question of   where, in just a few short years or months, your soul will be. O   may God give you grace to think of it and know that you are ready,   with the righteousness of Christ, to enter into life and not to   fall into the hands of omnipotent wrath.        Fun        I feel such a burden for us as a church to swim against the   tide of almost every current in our culture. More and more and   more, America is a nation given over to play. The industries of   play are huge! Houses are built today with entertainment centers.   Computers and videos and television and stereo all coordinate to   give us ever more stimulating and captivating distractions from   the realities of the world. When we need to be dreaming, for the   glory of Christ, about how to spend our lives alleviating   ignorance and sickness and misery and lostness, we are becoming   more and more addicted to amusement.        Make a little test of evangelical vocabulary, and calculate,   for example, the increasing frequency with which we use the world   "fun" to describe almost everything we like. But when do we   describe our good experiences as "meaningful" or "significant" or   "enriching" or "ennobling" or "worthwhile" or "edifying" or   "helpful" or "strengthening" or "encouraging" or "deepening" or   "transforming" or "valuable" or "eye-opening" or   "God-exalting"?        Examine yourself with this text: Whatever else it teaches, this   is clear, it teaches that after death there is eternal life and   glory and honor and peace, and there is eternal wrath and   indignation and tribulation and distress. And in the twinkling of   an eye, even before this service is over, you could be   irreversibly in the one or the other. I am a watchman on the wall.   And I have warned you as clearly as I know how. Get ready and stay   ready.        Live in the light of eternity. And I do mean light, not shadow.   When you have come to know your God, and love his Son so much that   you can say, "For me, to live is Christ and to die is gain," then   living in the light of eternity will replace your "fun" with   deeper, higher, wider, longer, more unshakable, more varied, more   satisfying, more durable, more solid pleasures than all the fun   that entertainment could ever give. O come, and let us be a   different breed of people for the few short years we have to live   upon this earth! Dream some dream of making your life count for   Christ and his Kingdom. "Only one life, 'twill soon be past. Only   what's done for Christ will last."        Land Mines and Oil Gushers        Now, what I've been saying from the depths of this text relates   to its surface points the way landmines and oil gushers beneath   the ground relate to walking around on the ground. They can either   blow you up or make you rich. But knowing they are there gives a   certain seriousness to life as you walk around on the ground where   they are buried. So let's walk around for a few final minutes on   the ground of this text to see the surface points and get   ourselves ready for what we will do with this text next week.        In Romans 1:18-32, Paul has shown that Gentiles are under the   power of sin and are without excuse before the judgment of God.   Therefore, they need the gospel that he announced in Romans   1:16-17. Now in Romans 2, Paul is making the same point about the   Jewish people who have the moral law in Scripture. They too are   under the power of sin and without excuse before the judgment of   God. To show that is the main aim of this chapter.        So Paul starts in verse 1: "Therefore you have no excuse,   everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge   another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same   things." He repeats the same indictment in verse 3: "You pass   judgment on those who practice such things and do the same   yourself." And again in verse 5: "Because of your stubbornness and   unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day   of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." So the   main point of verses 1-5 is that Jewish people who have the moral   law but don't keep it, will perish on the day of wrath. And God   will be just.        Then in verse 6, Paul gives a general statement in defense of   this indictment. He says, "&#91;God&#93; will render to each   person according to his deeds." In other words, judgment will not   accord with your Jewishness or Gentile status, or your intellect,   or family or race or nationality or any such thing. Because, as   verse 11 says, "There is no partiality with God." In the end, the   public evidence at the Judge's bench will be good deeds or bad -   and the same for Jew and Gentile.        Path to Life or Judgment        And so in verses 7-10, Paul now spells out, in two pairs of   verses, this judgment according to works. Verses 7 and 10 are   about how to have life. And verses 8 and 9 are about how to have   wrath. Take the positive pair first, and notice the path to life.   Verse 7: "To those who by perseverance in doing good seek for   glory and honor and immortality, &#91;God will render&#93; eternal   life." Then verse 10: "&#91;God will give&#93; glory and honor and   peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the   Greek." So the path to life is "persevering in doing good" in   verse 7 and "doing good" in verse 10.        Then consider the negative pair, and notice the path that leads   to wrath. First, verse 8: "But to those who are selfishly   ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,   &#91;God will render&#93; wrath and indignation." And then verse   9: "There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man   who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek." So the   path that leads to wrath is selfish ambition and disobedience to   the truth and obedience to unrighteousness and doing evil.        In other words, Jews and Gentiles are equally liable to   judgment. They are both under the power of sin. In fact, when Paul   says in verses 9 and 10 - in relation to both eternal life and   eternal wrath - "to the Jew first and also to the Greek," I think   he wants to say, Yes, the Jews go first. It may be first to heaven   or to hell. But the criterion, whether to the one or to the other,   is the same as for everybody else.        So the point of all these verses is that Jews as well as   Gentiles are liable to judgment, because that judgment will be   according to the life we have lived, not according to whether we   are Jews or Gentiles.        "According to Works"        Now that raises a question that we will deal with fully next   week. Are these verses only giving a hypothetical way to heaven -   "according to works"? Or is this the real way to heaven? In other   words, does verse 7 really mean, "To those who by perseverance in   doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, God WOULD   GIVE eternal life IF THEY COULD DO IT, WHICH THEY CAN'T AND   THEREFORE HAVE TO HAVE THE GOSPEL OF GRACE"? And does verse 10   mean, "&#91;God will give&#93; glory and honor and peace to   everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek IF   INDEED THEY CAN DO GOOD, WHICH THEY CAN'T, AND SO NEED THE GOSPEL   OF GRACE."?        In other words, is the point of these verses to describe a   hypothetical way to heaven along the path of obedience, just to   show that no one can walk it, and that therefore everyone needs   the gospel? Or should these verses be taken at face value, so that   they mean that the path to heaven is really the path of obedience,   and judgment really will accord with works?        Would it be a contradiction with the gospel of free and   sovereign grace if that Gospel were powerful enough that all who   truly believed it were radically changed by it and came to heaven   on the path of persevering obedience? If that were true - and I   think it is true - then the works that count would be the works of   faith, and at the judgment they would be the evidence of saving   faith in Christ. And our salvation would accord with them, but not   be based on them.        That's what I will try to show next Sunday. And I urge you to   ponder this immensely important issue for your own life. Because   beneath the surface of the ground where we are walking, there are   landmines and oil gushers. And everything is at stake in how we   walk.
