       "CALL ON ME IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE AND I WILL DELIVER YOU"    (Psalm 50:1-15)        
        The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from   the rising of the sun to its setting. Out of Zion, the perfection   of beauty, God shines forth. Our God comes, He does not keep   silence, before Him is a devouring fire, round about Him a mighty   tempest. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that He   may judge His people: "Gather to Me my faithful ones, who made a   covenant with Me by sacrifice!" The heavens declare His   righteousness, for God himself is judge! "Hear, O my people, and I   will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your   God. I do not reprove you for your sacrifices; your burnt   offerings are continually before me. I will accept no bull from   your house, nor he-goat from your folds. For every beast of the   forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the   birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I   were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world and all that is   in it is mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of   goats? Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows   to the Most High; and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will   deliver you, and you shall glorify me."        This Psalm is a word from the Lord about a wrong view of God   leading to a wrong way of sacrificing to God. It has something   very crucial to say about how our view of God relates to our money   and our giving to God's cause. I chose this text because I wanted   to address the root issue of our financial condition, namely the   issue of God.        Our financial condition is this: Our budget commitment to   missions and to ministry here this year is 1 million sixty-four   thousand dollars. Taking the adult worshipers who come to   Bethlehem regularly that commitment would cost about $19.23 a week   per person or $2.75 a day ($1.84 to the local ministries and $.91   to missions).        But as of last Sunday we were $160,000 short in this budget   giving. So to meet our budget this year we need an average of   $35,000 each Sunday for the rest of the year. That means that if   all our regularly attending worshipers gave an equal share there   would be $362.50 each left to be given in this year. Or $33.00 a   week for the remaining 11 Sundays. If you add to that the goal of   $10,000 a Sunday for the new sanctuary, what we really need is $43   a week for the rest of this year from each regularly attending   adult. That amounts to a tithe of an annual salary of $22,360 per   person. With a lot of homemaking spouses, and with many young   people and students, and with numerous retired people, I don't   know if we average $22,000 annual salaries or not.        Probably not. Which means at least three things.        1) One is that compared to other churches you are giving very   well (64% increase over two years ago at this time!).        2) A second thing that this means is that reaching our goals   will simply require far more than tithing for many of us.        3) Third, God is the root issue in this matter. Our shortfall   has to do with our view of God. And if we reach our goals this   year it will have to do more with God than anything else. So let's   turn our attention now to the God who owns us and everything we   have.        In Psalm 50 what we have is a courtroom scene. The roof of the   courtroom is heaven above, and the floor is the earth beneath. God   himself is the judge. Verse 4b: he is there to judge his people;   and verse 6b: "God himself if judge." God is the clerk of court.   Verse 5: he calls the defendants to the bench: "Gather to me my   faithful ones." And God is the chief witness. Verse 7: "Hear O my   people and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you." So   from that verse you can also see that the defendants in the trial   are God's own people.        Once the scene is established (in verses 1-7) there comes the   indictment, the sentence, the rationale or explanation for the   indictment and sentence, the prescribed correction and a statement   of the ultimate goal that the judge is trying to accomplish in   this trial. Let's move through these and then focus on the   practical implications for us as a church.        First the indictment: Verse 8. It is not stated directly. It is   implied indirectly: "I do not reprove you for your sacrifices;   your burnt offerings are continually before me." So the indictment   is not that they have neglected to give sacrifices to God. The   indictment is that they are giving sacrifices with a wrong   mindset. This is seen in the next verses. The mindset is that God   somehow needs these sacrifices&yuml;.&yuml;.&yuml;.&yuml;that he   is dependent on his people for his food or for his satisfaction or   strength. That's the indictment &#151; their sacrifices insult God   as a needy God or a dependent God.        The sentence for this insult is given in verse 9: God says, "I   will accept no bull from your house, nor he-goat from your folds."   The sentence is to nullify the sacrifice &#151; to declare that it   is not pleasing to him. This is a devastating sentence. It   basically says that the center of their religious practice is   empty and void as long as this mindset prevails.        Then (in verses 10-13) comes the rationale or the explanation   for the indictment and the sentence. This is the heart of the   text. This is most important, because it reveals who God really   is. The rationale for the indictment has two parts. One part says   (in verse 12), "If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the   world and all that is in it is mine." And the other part says (in   verse 13), As a matter of fact I do not get hungry: "Do I eat the   flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?"        So you can see more clearly here what the insulting mindset was   that the people were on trial for. They had a view of God that   made him dependent on them. They slipped into the religious notion   that their gifts were somehow meeting God's needs and that he   would be at a loss without them.        And his response is to say that he does not need their   sacrifices for two reasons. One is that he is never hungry and   never eats. He is always totally satisfied with what he is in   himself and what he does for his glory. His food is to do his will   (John 4:34). God is an infinite ocean of supply, not a little   water trough that needs filling with the buckets of our supply.   Acts 17:25 says, "God is not served by human hands as though he   needed anything, for he himself gives to all men life and breath   and everything."        The other reason he does not need our sacrifices is that if he   were ever to get hungry he would not have to depend on us for his   meals because he owns everything. Verse 12 said it in general:   "The world and all that is in it is mine." But verses 10-11 spell   it out in amazing detail so that we don't miss the point: "Every   beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I   know all the birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is   mine."        The point of the psalm is that there are no exceptions: God   owns everything. Strictly speaking, human beings own nothing. What   we call ownership is really trusteeship. From the birds of the air   to the bugs of the field, from the beasts of the forest to the   cattle of the hills &#151; it is all God's .He can do with it as   he pleases. It is impossible for God to steal, because there isn't   anything he doesn't own.        This is what the people had forgotten. And so they were   insulting God in their worship by coming with the mindset that   they would now give to GOD some of THEIR possessions. They had not   learned to sing,        We give thee but thine own       What e're the gift may be,       All that we have is thine alone,       A trust O Lord from thee.              They had forgotten the truth,       All things are Thine: no gift have we       Lord of all gifts to offer Thee;       And hence with grateful hearts today       Thine own before Thy feet we lay.       
        Next then in the text comes the correction in verses 14-15a.   What should we do if we have fallen into this evil mindset that   treats our possessions as though they were ours and not God's   &#151; that treats God as though he is somehow poor and deficient   without us?        Verses 14-15a say to do three things:        "Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,       and pay your vows to the Most High;       and call upon me in the day of trouble."        This is a description of the corrected mindset. First, every   sacrifice must be a sacrifice of thanksgiving because the real   giver in every act of my giving is God? If I have something to   give it is because it belongs to God and he put it in my hands. If   I have a WILL to give it is because God put it there (1 Chronicles   29:14,18; Philippians 2:13; Hebrews 13:21; 2 Corinthians 8:1). Our   giving is really God's giving to us. Therefore ALL giving must be   a sacrifice of gratitude. If we don't see this, how can we but   insult God?        Second the corrected mindset pays its vows to the Most High. If   you want to see what a vow is look at Psalm 66:13-14.        I will come into thy house with burnt offerings;       I will pay thee my vows,       that which my lips uttered       and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.        A vow is a promise you make to God when you are in trouble. I   made a vow one time when I was a junior in college. I said, "Lord   if you will help me get though this public prayer in chapel   without my voice closing up because of nervousness, I will never   again turn down a speaking opportunity out of fear."        Paying a vow is not paying a salary or paying a bribe. It is   simply keeping your word. It is not lying. It is a matter of   faith. Do you trust God to be as good and helpful for you in the   fulfillment of your vow as he was in delivering you from trouble?   So paying a vow honors God as the owner of all things by looking   back at the time he helped you and by expressing trust that he   will keep on doing that in your fulfillment of the vow.        The third thing the corrected mindset does is call upon God in   the day of trouble (verse 15a). In other words God is not the one   in trouble. He is always in a position to save from trouble. God   is not hungry or poor. He is infinitely resourceful. So the way   not to insult him is to need him and to call to him for help.        So that is the corrected mindset: be thankful, pay your vows,   call for help.        Now finally we ask what is the ultimate goal of the judge in   this courtroom? What is God trying to accomplish in the life of   his people? The last line of verse 15 gives the answer: "I will   deliver you, and you will glorify me." He wants to answer their   cry for help so that they will glorify him. His goal is our good   and his glory. We get the salvation; he gets the exaltation. We   get delivered; he gets admired.        That is the goal of the psalm. It's the goal of our church. And   it is the goal of God in all that he does &#151; to satisfy his   hungry people and glorify himself, who never gets hungry. "I will   deliver you, and you will glorify me."        Now here are the lessons that I want to apply to us in our   financial situation at home and at the church.        1. Keep God great in your eyes. Beware of a mindset that   belittles and insults God. God is an absolutely unstoppable,   unfailing, constant, volcano of power and fire and joy and help.   He never wearies in the slightest and is omnipotently enthusiastic   about his gracious purposes in your life. Never let a weak or   miserly or tightfisted or weary or boring God enter your mind. He   owns all and loves to glorify his power and grace by delivering   people who call on him. Keep God great in your eyes for the rest   of this year.        2. Believe his promise in verse 15: "Call on me in the day of   trouble and I will deliver you." In the day of financial trouble   trust him! Remember he is talking to people in this psalm who are   on trial in his court for insulting him. There is hope even for   these &#151; and for you. Believe God.        3. Call on the Lord. Always pray and do not lose heart. Wait   patiently for the Lord. He will come just when it is best for you.   Call him to help you make the money you need, to have the job you   need, to find the courage you need to give what you should.        4. If he leads you make a vow. (It's not required. Deuteronomy   23:21-23.) For example, suppose the car mechanic calls you   Thursday morning and says, "Your car needs new rear axles and axle   bearings. It will cost $750." You cringe. "Is there no other way?"   "No, they are shot." "Well, O.K. Go ahead." Might not the Holy   Spirit lead you to pray at lunch with your wife, "Father, please   get it done cheaper than the mechanic said" and to make a vow,   "Lord if you do this I will give to the ministry of the church   whatever you save on this bill." That happened to Noel and me this   week and there is a $222 check in the offering this morning to   praise God for his answer to prayer. Somehow we were going to live   without that money in order to have a working car. We can live   without it for the sake of the ministry here too.        5. Finally when God delivers you and this church from the day   of trouble, glorify him with all your heart.        I close with a call to prayer over the next 11 weeks. I have   felt led for some weeks to make a special commitment of prayer for   the financial strength of the church. So I would like to tell you   my vow and invite you to join me as the Lord leads. Lord willing,   I will be in the prayer room each Friday from 6:30 to 7:00 AM from   now to the end of the year seeking the Lord for three things: 1)   that we will not fail in any of our mission and ministry   commitments; 2) that the Lord's choice for our Minister for   Children's Discipleship would be known and called by Thanksgiving;   and 3) that people would be saved weekly though the anointed   witness of our church.
