        THANKS BE TO GOD FOR HIS INEXPRESSIBLE GIFT    (2 Corinthians 9:15)        Do you think that the major communication media of our society   provide you with serious insight and counsel on the most important   issues in life? I mean the utterly crucial questions like        1) How can I as a sinful person have peace with a      righteous God? How can I have my sins forgiven and his judgment      taken away?             2) How can I know that beyond the grave there will be life      and joy and not a fearful prospect of judgment?              3) How can I have the deepest longings of my heart      satisfied, not just the superficial desires for comfort and      prosperity, but the deep, deep heart-cries of the night?              4) How can I know God personally? Can I have a relationship      with him now, and walk with him as with a friend?              5) Is there a power to love? Is there a power that can      really change people, so they don't do drugs or steal or cheat      or hate or kill?         These are the great issues of life. But where will we turn for   insight and wisdom and counsel and truth? The great media powers   of our land &#151; the newspapers, the magazines, the television,   the radio &#151; are silent on the greatest issues in the world.   And the effect this silence has is to spread an assumption   throughout the mindset of our society that these questions are no   more important than your private preference for pizza over   potatoes.        Blaise Pascal, the French mathematician and philosopher who   died in 1662 said, "Man's sensitivity to small things, and his   insensitivity to the most important things, are surely evidences   of a strange disorder." Pascal thought that if there is a   possibility that there is a God in heaven, and if there is a   possibility that there is eternity and judgment beyond the grave   &#151; just the possibility! &#151; then reasonable people will be   earnestly engaged in settling these things for themselves and   getting right with God and preparing for the endless ages of   existence beyond this world.        But what do we see? We see a modern culture that has no   significant place for these questions at all. And we see people   like the man I sat beside on the plane flying in from Madison   Thursday night. I struck up a conversation with him and he found   out I was a pastor. He asked, "Are you happy in that line of   work?" I said, "Yes, I think it is exactly where God wants me, and   I think I could be happy anywhere if I knew it was God's will for   me to be there."        He responded, "Well, I'm not a very religious person." I said,   "If there's a God, nothing's more important than being right with   him." He quickly responded, "Oh, I believe there's a God."        That's a portrait of millions of Americans: "I believe there's   a God . . . but I'm not a very religious person." It's like   saying, "I believe there's a great doctor who could heal my   terminal disease . . . but I don't try to find him." "I believe   there's a rescue boat that could reach me adrift at sea . . . but   I don't cry out." "I believe there's a treasure hidden in nearby   field . . . but I won't sell anything to buy it." We live in a   very dark and strange age. What I've been praying as I have   prepared for this service is that none of you would be asleep like   that, but that God would wake us up to what really matters in   life.        What I want to do this morning is take the five questions we   started with, which seem to me to be the most important questions   in the world, and show from God's word that Jesus is the answer   &#151; that Jesus is God's gift to the world and that he is so   valuable the Bible calls him an "inexpressible gift."        1) How can I as a sinful person have peace with a righteous   God? How can I have my sins forgiven and God's judgment taken   away?        Every one of us knows that the Bible is right when it says,   "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God" (Romans   3:23). We also know intuitively that God is just and must be   reckoned with. As the Bible says, "It is appointed to man once to   die and after that comes judgment." We will give an account to God   for our lives.        So our hearts tell us loud and clear, we must find a way to get   right with God!        Jesus is God's inexpressible gift to meet this need.        The Bible tells of the time a man came seeking healing from   Jesus. Jesus looked on him and his friends and saw their faith and   said, "My son, your sins are forgiven" (Mark 2:5). But some of the   religious leaders sitting there said to themselves, "This is   blasphemy!"        Now why did they think Jesus committed blasphemy when he said,   "Your sins are forgiven" ?        You can see the answer if you put yourself in this position.   Suppose I sock Tom Steller in the nose for no good reason. And   before Tom has a chance to say anything or retaliate, you step in   and say to me, "Now let me settle this before it gets out of hand.   John, I forgive you for hitting Tom. There, now, all is well."        Tom would have a right to say, "What in the world do you think   you are doing? He hit ME not you. You can't just step in here and   forgive him. I have to forgive him!"        That, in essence is what the religious leaders were saying to   Jesus. "Who do you think you are? This man sinned against GOD! GOD   has to forgive him not you! You are committing blasphemy because   you act as though you were God."        To this Jesus calmly responded, "The Son of Man has authority   on earth to forgive sins." And then he healed the man to validate   his authority. Jesus did what only God has the right to do:   forgive sins.        The choice we must make is this: either Jesus was a Jimmy   Bakker, or Jesus was the Son of God who takes away the sins of all   who believe in him. Jesus is God's answer to our first great   question. He came and suffered and died and rose again from the   dead to pay the price for our sins. He is no charlatan. When we   trust him as Lord and Savior of our lives we have peace with God,   our sins are forgiven, and there is no more condemnation (Romans   5:1; 8:1; Ephesians 2:13-16).        And we sing, "Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!"        2) How can I know that beyond the grave there will be life and   joy and not a fearful prospect of judgment?        It is an amazing thing how little concern people have for   eternity. About three weeks ago I asked a man if he were ready to   meet God when he died, and he just laughed it off, and said, "Oh,   I'm sure God will just send me the other way when I show up at the   door." I tried to help him see how serious this matter was, and he   just pulled back and wouldn't talk about it.        Believe me, the Bible is clear on this: there is a heaven and   there is a hell. Both last forever. And where we spend eternity is   chosen in this life. And Jesus is the way to heaven, the only way.   "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son   that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have   everlasting life" (John 3:16).        You can know what is coming and sing, "Thanks be to God for his   inexpressible gift!"        3) How can I have the deepest longings of my heart satisfied,   not just the superficial desires for comfort and prosperity, but   the deep, deep heart-cries of the night?        Gary Gaetti, the third baseman for the Twins, said that in 1987   he thought winning the World Series was the greatest thrill in the   world. This was the peak of fame and fortune. But he writes,        Then in 1988 I came to know Jesus Christ as my personal Savior   and Lord of my life. Believe me, friend, the World Series was   great but nothing compares to the thrill of having a personal   relationship with God through Jesus and knowing you have your name   written in the record books of eternal, everlasting life.        There is no denying that the world has some thrills to offer.   But the older and the wiser you get the more you realize they do   not satisfy. They aren't deep enough to touch the longings of the   heart and they don't last.        The reason is that the appetites of our hearts were made for   God and they will not be satisfied until we feast on fellowship   with God. Jesus said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to me   shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst."   Everybody is thirsty. Everybody is searching for a fountain of   everlasting joy. When you find Jesus the search is over.        The heart sings, "Thanks be to God for his inexpressible   gift!"        4) How can I know God personally? Can I have a relationship   with him now, and walk with him as with a friend?        Yesterday's paper reported that two Harvard astronomers had   discovered a "great wall" of galaxies spread through the universe   500 million light years across. A light year is six trillion   miles. So that makes the wall of galaxies three billion trillion   miles across.        Now if you believe, with the Bible, that God created everything   that is not God, then God is unspeakably great. And the bigger the   universe gets the greater God gets. But for some, this means he is   farther and farther away and harder and harder to know and to   love.        But Jesus is the answer. "In the beginning was the Word, and   the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the   beginning with God; all thing were made through him, and without   him was not anything made that was made. . . And the Word became   flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld   his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father" (John   1:1-4,14). God in the person of His Son has become flesh - human.   And Jesus said to Philip, "If you have seen me you have seen the   Father" (John 14:9).        Jesus is God reaching out to us. God wants to be known. He   wants to be loved. He wants to be a Father and a Friend. And   though he is great beyond all imagination, he came near in Jesus   so that we could know him. "If you had known me, you would have   known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him"   (John 14:7).        We can know God &#151; just as personally as you know anyone in   this world.        Your heart can sing, "Thanks be to God for his inexpressible   gift."        5) Is there a power to love? Is there a power that can really   change people, so they don't do drugs or steal or cheat or hate or   kill?        The answer to this question can be found in the Bible and can   be found in the lives of those who know Jesus best. In the Bible   Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I   who live but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in   the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave   himself for me." And the life Paul lived by faith in the Son of   God was an incredible life of love and sacrifice and joy for the   good of people and the glory of God.        Paul had no doubt at all that there is a power that really   changes people. Namely, the power of Jesus Christ when we trust in   him.        Let me close with a story that I just heard this week of God's   power in a man's life. When I heard it I knew God was giving it to   me so that I could give it to you.        I had lunch last Wednesday with a black pastor named James   Ford. He's the pastor at South Shore Baptist Church in Chicago. I   asked him if he grew up in a home where there was a mom and a dad.   And he told me his amazing story of God's grace in his life.        He was the oldest of ten children and grew up on welfare in   Pittsburgh. His dad was never at home. His mom told him early on   that his dad was dead. Then when he was older she said he was   alive and in prison in Tennessee. But before his dad could get out   he was murdered for selling bad drugs. Jim swore that if he ever   had a son he would not leave him like his dad left him.        He began using drugs. In the service he was put in jail for it   at least once. When he got out he got married and had a son named   Jay. But all this time he and his wife were using drugs. He would   blow smoke into his four-year-old son's face to make him high and   watch him do funny things.        His wife began to play around on him. He said he resolved to   kill her and the other guy, and then die in the shoot out if   necessary since he swore after the service he'd never do time in   jail again.        But two things happened to stop him. One day at work a man   &#151; a southern white &#151; named Ray Reno, who called himself   a "ridge-running hippie from Tennessee," saved Jim's life by   pulling him back from a falling crane. That made Jim willing to   listen to Ray when he said, "Jim, whatever your problem is, Jesus   is the answer." That's all he said.        Then Jim's brother talked him out of killing his wife and said   he should just move out and leave her. So he decided to spend one   more night with her and then leave. That night they were both on   the couch high as a kite on what he called Columbia Gold laced   with embalming fluid. Then something amazing happened.        Jim's wife said, "What about Jay?" And Jim said to me, "I could   feel the high go out of me. It began at the top of my head and   went down through my face and drained out of my whole body until I   was stone cold sober. And the very first thing I did, right there   in front of my wife was hit the floor and start calling on God,   'God, don't hurt me! God, don't hurt me!'"        No one had to convince Jim he was a sinner. All he had to be   convinced of was that God was real and now he knew that beyond any   doubt. And that meant trouble.        But God didn't hurt him. He healed him. The next day at work,   he went around telling everybody, "God is real. God is real." His   boss thought he had flipped out and sent him home. But on his way   out, he looked up on a scaffold and saw Ray Reno, and called out,   "Ray, God is real." Ray came down and gave him a big bear hug and   took out his New Testament and showed Jim what really   happened.        From then on for the next several months Ray would drive every   Thursday afternoon from his suburb to the inner city of Pittsburgh   to have a Bible study with Jim. Jim told him once, "My old drug   dealing buddies think you're a NARC and said they were going to   kill you and me. Maybe you shouldn't come in any more."        To this Ray said, "Jim, if Jesus can shed his blood for me I   can shed my blood for you."        Today fourteen years later James Ford has three sons. His wife   is a faithful partner and he has been a pastor for over eight   years.        Is there a power to love? Is there a power that can really   change people?        Is there a way to have eternal life?        Is there a way for sins to be forgiven?        Is there a way for your deepest longings to be satisfied?        Is there a way to know God personally and be his friend?        The answer is a resounding yes. And that yes is Jesus Christ,   God's inexpressible gift to you this Thanksgiving season. If you   have never personally received Jesus as the Lord and Savior of   your life, I commend him to you. And I urge you to trust him and   call upon him for all the help you need. "Whoever calls upon the   name of the Lord will be saved" (Romans 10:13) Thanks be to God   for his inexpressible gift!        Copyright 1989, 1998 John Piper      Piper's   Notes
