  June 5, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       HOW TO SUFFER FOR DOING WHAT IS RIGHT    (1 Peter 2:18-23)        Servants, be submissive to your masterswith all      respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to      those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the      sake of conscience toward God a man bears up under sorrows when      suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you sin      and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if      when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently      endure it, this finds favor with God. For you have been called      for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving      you an example for you to follow in His steps, who committed no      sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth; and while being      reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering He      uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who      judges righteously; and He Himself bore our sins in His body on      the cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness;      for by His wounds you were healed. For you were continually      straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd      and Guardian of your souls.         As I ponder paragraph after paragraph in 1 Peter one of the   overwhelming impressions I get is that it makes a difference to be   Christian. I recall talking about this with some InterVarsity   student workers at Stanford University a few years ago. Tom and I   were out there together looking at the impact of Christian   Hedonism on that chapter and the whole Bay Area.       I remember one of the students saying how incredible it was to   him that Christianity could be viewed by many students as a   belief-system that could be added onto their present lives with   little change. Studies remained pretty much the same. Leisure   remained pretty much the same. Use of money remained pretty much   the same. Goals after graduation remained pretty much the same.   Students simply said, "I can believe that," and added it on to   what they were already committed to. It didn't seem to make a   difference.       One of the reasons I use the word "radical" as often as I do to   describe the kind of Christianity that I am pursuing is that I   need some kind of language to differentiate the real thing from   this "add on" kind of Christianity that is not real and confuses   thousands about what the real thing is. Radical Christianity, real   Christianity, makes a difference.       Peter is writing his letter about that, and we get another   picture of it in today's text.       Remember the context: Verse 9: you are an elect nation, and a   people for God's own possession. Your reason for existence is to   "proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness   into his marvelous light."       Verse 11: Therefore you are strangers and aliens in this world   and your goal is to live such a life that people would glorify   God. So verse 9 and verse 11 give the same goal for Christians:   live in a way that shows God. But a Christianity that makes no   visible difference simply cannot show God. It is not true   Christianity.       Then Peter starts to give some examples of what true   Christianity looks like in the hostile world of his day. Last week   we saw how he showed Christians to relate to the state (vv.   13-17). Today he takes up another tough situation: what if you are   a servant with an unbelieving master or even a crooked and abusive   master? What does radical Christianity look like in that   situation?       Peter tells us what it looks like.       Verse 18: Christian servants are submissive with all respect to   their masters.       Verse 19: Christian servants bear up under sorrows when they   suffer unjustly.       Verse 20: Christian servants do good and when they suffer for   it they bear the suffering patiently.       Verse 23: Christian servants do not return evil for evil; when   reviled they do not revile back or threaten.       In other words Christians are not defiant or rebellious or   insolent. They have a spirit of meekness and submission and   compliance -- even when their masters are unreasonable and   abusive.       Now we should ask: What does this have to do with showing God?   How does this "declare the excellencies of him who called us out   of darkness into his marvelous light"? How is this a kind of life   that will cause people "to glorify God on the day of visitation"?       The first part of the answer is that this heart and this   demeanor are utterly contrary to fallen human nature. In fact I   would venture that in dozens of hearts in this room right now   strong feelings of resistance are rising against this call for   meekness and submission and compliance -- even to unreasonable and   abusive masters.       By nature we hate to give the impression of weakness. We hate   to look like someone got the advantage of us. We hate to let false   accusations against us stand. We hate it when unreasonable and   abusive people seem to have the last say. Tremendous powers within   us recoil and push us toward retaliation.       So what Peter calls for here is utterly contrary to our fallen   human nature. That's the first thing to say when we ask: What does   this demeanor have to do with showing God. If we triumph over our   own fallen nature and live at this amazing level, it is strong   evidence that something more than nature -- outside nature, above   nature -- is at work in our lives.       That is in fact what Peter says is the case. He tells us five   times that this amazing kind of life, so contrary to human nature,   is owing to our connection with God. God is being shown, because   God is the key to this utterly counter-natural way of life. In   other words for these people Christianity DID make a difference. A   radical difference. The root of their fallen nature is severed by   the axe of God. They now are living from radically different   premises, different values, different priorities, a different   focus altogether.       Notice the five times that Peter connects to God this radical   freedom from our old, natural spirit of retaliation. 1        1. Conscience toward God       Verse 19: "For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience   toward God a man bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly."   We do not endure sorrow and unjust suffering out of the fear of   man or even out of our own weakness. Those are irrelevant. We bear   it "for the sake of conscience toward God." That is, we take God   into account. We look to God and not to our circumstances. God is   the unseen factor for the world. They will never understand our   behavior when we live to God. Why don't you fight back? The   Christian servant answers, "My conscience is bound to God." We   will see more clearly in a minute what difference that makes..       2. Favor with God       Verse 20: "For what credit is there if, when you sin and are   harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do   what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this   finds favor with God.       I think what Peter means here is that God delights in behavior   that reflects utter reliance on his grace when the supports of the   world are knocked out. When a Christian, out of "conscience toward   God," looks to God for strength and courage and hope and peace in   a time of suffering; and as a result bears the suffering   patiently, God sees it as a tribute to his grace. God is shown in   it. And when God is shown God is pleased.       3. Called by God to suffer       Verse 21a: "For you have been called for this purpose." Here   the point is that this kind of non-retaliating, gracious,   submissive behavior is owing to a call from God. "You have been   called for this." Suffering unjustly in this world is not a   coincidence for Christians; it's a calling. "To this you were   called."       He says it again in 3:9, ". . .not returning evil for evil, or   insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were   called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing."       Suffering with patience shows God because it is an answer to   his calling; it is obedience to our vocation.       4. Christ as our example       Verse 21b: "Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an   example for you to follow in His steps."       Enduring unjust suffering patiently shows God because it makes   the suffering of Christ real to people. People can see that this   is the way Jesus was. And if you have seen Jesus you have seen the   Father (John 14:9). So this kind of demeanor shows God by showing   Christ his Son.       5. Entrust yourself to God who judges righteously       Verse 23: "While being reviled, He &#91;Jesus&#93; did not   revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept   entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously."       Here is one of the most important keys to how patient endurance   of unjust suffering shows God. When you endure unjust suffering   "for the sake of conscience toward God," you are not saying   justice doesn't matter; you are saying is that God is the final   judge and will settle accounts justly. My abuser will not have the   last say. God will have the last say. This is why I don't need to.   I defer to God. As Peter says, "I entrust myself, and not just   myself, but my cause and my accusers, and the whole situation and   the justice that needs to be done -- I hand it all over to God."       So my compliance is not an indifference to justice. It is a way   of saying that the safest place for retaliatory justice is in   God's hands, not mine. The powerful cry of my heart that I get my   rights is handed over to God. If I am to be vindicated, it will be   God who vindicates me "when he has tried and purged me duly"   through suffering.       Let me close with three brief comments of application.       1. Does God will the unjust suffering of his people?       I think this text assumes that God sometimes wills for his   people to suffer unjustly. I see that in verse 21: "you were   called to this." But lest you doubt that Peter says the same thing   more explicitly several other places. For example in 4:19, "Let   those also who suffer according to the will of God entrust their   souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right." And again in   3:17, "It is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for   doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong."       God wills this because he knows the best way for us to bring   glory to him -- sometimes by miraculously escaping suffering, and   sometimes (more often) by graciously bearing suffering, that we do   not deserve from men, because we trust in God.       God often wills that we suffer unjustly and that we bear it by   his grace and for his glory.       2. Where is justice for the wrongdoing of abusive masters?       There are two answers. One is: justice is in God at the last   day. God will settle all accounts justly. No one will get away   with anything. Those who hold Christ and his people in derision   and do not repent will one day cry out for the rocks and mountains   to fall upon them rather than face the wrath of the Lamb   (Revelation 6:16).       The other answer is that God has given a measure of his   authority for retaliation in this age to the state as his minister   for keeping order and peace in society. 1 Peter 2:14 says that God   ordains kings and governors to "punish evildoers and praise those   who do right." So God wills that governments punish those who   cause Christians (or anyone else) to suffer unjustly. We may   legitimately labor for such a government. But the God-given rights   of the state to retaliate and punish does not nullify the   God-given calling of the individual Christian to endure unjust   suffering patiently. God's glory shines partly through his   dispensing of justice through the state. But it shines much more   through the patient, God-centered suffering of his people.       3. Finally, what is it about God that is shown through our   patient, non-retaliating endurance of unjust suffering?       1 Peter 2:9 says that our lives are to "proclaim the   excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his   marvellous light." So what are the excellencies of God that shine   through this kind of meekness and endurance and patience?       It is a very long list. We can only give a start down the list.       A. When we suffer unjustly and patiently with our trust in God   we are surrendering some very precious things (health, comfort,   ease) and so we are show the excellency of God's superior   preciousness (1 Peter 2:7).       B. When we suffer with patient faith in God we surrender much   of our claim to be protected and cared for on earth and so we show   the excellency of God's superior shepherd care for us (1 Peter   2:25; 5:7).       C. When we suffer with patient faith in God we go without the   glory of fighting back and winning; and so we show the excellency   of God's superior glory that he will share with us some day, and   the justice of his throne that will one day settle all accounts (1   Peter 2:23; 4:13; 5:1,4).       D. When we suffer with patient faith in God we seem to take a   tremendous risk with our life -- the only life most people believe   we have to enjoy -- and so we show the excellency of God's   faithfulness and trustworthiness (1 Peter 4:19).       E. We seem to throw way our one chance for happiness by not   fighting for more comforts here; and so we show the excellency of   God's power to raise us from the dead as a faithful creator and   one who has all dominion in the universe (1 Peter 4:19; 5:11).       F. Finally, when we endure unjust suffering meekly by trusting   in God, we acknowledge that we are still sinners and are not   earning anything by this patience. And so we show the excellency   of God's great grace (1 Peter 5:10).       So when your time comes keep these great words in mind from 1   Peter 5:10,       And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all   grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself   perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. To him be the   dominion for ever and ever.         1 . It may be that there are six instances if "with all   respect" in verse 18 is a reference to respect for God. Pointing   in this direction is the fact that the preceding verse says we are   to "fear God" and a related word is used in verse 18, "in all   fear". So verse 18 may well mean, Submit to your earthly master   out of the fear of God. This would parallel verse 13: Submit to   every human institution on account of the Lord.
