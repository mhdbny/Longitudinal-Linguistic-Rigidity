      November 5, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of   Bethlehem Baptist Church   Volume 7    A Vision for Harvest   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document:   A Reaffirmed Vision; Missions Fest, 1995       Missions: Seeing Reality the Way Jesus Sees It     One of the reasons missions is at the heartof Christianity is that  Jesus teaches us to see the world utterly differently than weordinarily see it. If you  simply view the world the way it is seen in television and secularmedia and public  education and theater, missions will make no sense and be no partof your life. In fact I  would say that if you want to see how much the secular cultureshapes and controls you,  simply ask how great is your burden for missions. The only way tohave a burden for  missions is to be more influenced by Jesus than by the Americanculture. To see the world  the way Jesus sees it.    Let me illustrate from John&#146;s gospel howJesus was always trying  to help us see the world differently from the way we ordinarilysee it. In John 2:15 Jesus  made a whip and drove all the money-changers out of the temple inJerusalem. When the  indignant money-makers asked him for a sign of his authority, hetotally blew their minds  with a view of the world that staggered them. He said in verse 19,            Destroy this temple, and in three daysI will raise it up.              What did he mean? He meant, Change the way youlook at your world. This  temple where you sell goats and pigeons, is coming to and end. Itwill be replaced by  another temple, namely, me. I will be the place where you meetGod. But they didn&#146;t  get it. All they could think to say was, It took 46 years tobuild this temple and  you think you can build it in three days?. They did not seethe world the way Jesus  did. And that is why a lot of people today don&#146;t getmissions. They just don&#146;t  get it. The reality they live it is too narrow, too small.    Here&#146;s another example. In John 3Nicodemus comes to Jesus at  night to try and figure out who he is. Jesus blows his mind inverse 3 by saying,  Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom ofGod. Nicodemus  doesn&#146;t get at all. He can only say, How can a man beborn when he is old? He  cannot enter a second time into his mother&#146;s womb and beborn, can he? (v. 4).  Jesus is trying to get him to see the world in a radicallydifferent way. There are  spiritual realities that Nicodemus is not seeing at all. Until hedoes, entering the  kingdom of heaven will make no sense. That&#146;s why missionsmakes no sense to so many  people today. There are spiritual realities that Jesus lives andbreathes -- the main  realities of the universe -- that people don&#146;t get. The justshake their head and  say, What is the big deal?    Here&#146;s another example. In chapter fourJesus meets the Samaritan  woman at the well and drops a bombshell on her worldview. He saysin verse 10 If you  knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &#145;Give Mea drink,&#146; you  would have asked Him, and He would have given you livingwater. She doesn&#146;t get  it, and says, Sir, You have nothing to draw with and thewell is deep; where then do  You get that living water? He is trying to get her to seeanother world, and she is  stuck in this one. He is moving her to see the world of water andthirst and desire and  satisfaction in a totally new way. At first she doesn&#146;t getit. But she will. So some  people today at first don&#146;t get missions, because theydon&#146;t see the world the  way Jesus does. They can see a temple made of bricks and a birthwith blood and pain and  water from a well. But they don&#146;t get a man who is a temple,and a birth by the  Spirit, and water that satisfies for ever. Missions assumes awhole new way of looking at  the world.    One more example before we look at our text. Inchapter six Jesus  miraculously feeds over 5,000 people from five barley loaves andtwo fish. The point was  to help these people see the world in a radically different way --that there is power  from heaven that can nourish you way beyond what bread can. So inverse 27 Jesus says,  Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the foodwhich endures to eternal  life, which the Son of Man shall give to you. But theydidn&#146;t get it. Jesus  said to them, You seek Me, not because you saw signs, butbecause you ate of the  loaves, and were filled (v. 26). They were stuck in theirlimited worldview.    The point of these four illustrations is this:Jesus wants us to see  the world differently than the way we ordinarily see it. You willnever have a heart for  missions if you don&#146;t see the world the way Jesus sees it.Missions depends on seeing  reality the way Jesus sees it. A different vision.    So let&#146;s go to our text, John 4:31-38, andlet Jesus shape our  vision for the harvest.     Local Evangelism and Missions     But before we do let me make clear thatwhat I have said applies to  both concern for local evangelism and concern for culturallydistant missions. Missions is  when you cross a culture to win people to Christ and plant hischurch. Local evangelism is  when you reach out to people in your own culture where the churchhas already been  planted.     William Wilberforce     I read recently a great story about WilliamWilberforce, the  British Christian politician who labored about 200 years ago tooverthrow the slave trade  in Britain. It illustrates what happens in your relationships withpeople when you see the  world the way Jesus sees it. Wilberforce was surrounded by peoplewho were hardened to  personal faith in Christ by the formalities of their churches andtheir nominally  Christian boarding schools. But his way of looking at the worldwas that they were in  great need of personal faith in Christ as their Savior, andpersonal walk of allegiance to  Jesus as Lord.     So he would keep a list of people that he wastalking to about vital  religion and personal faith, with ideas on how to approach them.He would often spend an  hour following dinner -- this is what really struck me in thisstory -- thinking out how  he might develop what he called launchers -- openingsin conversation with  friends so as to launch into a talk of religion.Isn&#146;t that remarkable?  Have you ever done that? You are not alone. It&#146;s been donefor centuries by people  who care for perishing sinners. One entry in his journal read:          [Mr.] S . . . and Mrs. What books [are they]reading? To give them good    ones -- Walker&#146;s Sermons. Call on Mrs. S. and talk alittle. Lend her Venn&#146;s    last Sermon. Education of their children, to inquire about.Prayer, etc. Their coming some    Sunday to Battersea Rise to hear Venn. Call often , and bekind.       It seemed that he often communicated more thanhe thought. One story  goes like this:         Once, after talking for some time to an illfriend, Lord N . .    ., Wilberforce was aware that he had not broached theissue of religion. Another    friend came in and asked the invalid how he was. Lord N. . .replied : As well as I    can be, with Wilberforce sitting here and telling me I am goingto hell.       So here is a world class statesman of theBritish Parliament, who  labored for decades in the frustrating, secular business ofpolitics to overcome the slave  trade in Great Britain, taking time with a friend to warn himabout a reality that he  would never have seen except that he learned from Jesus to see theworld in a totally  different way.     Missions: Nourishing Your Soul on God     Now look at John 4:31ff. Jesus has finishedtalking to the  Samaritan woman at the well and she has gone back to town with atotally different view of  the world. The disciples have come back from the town and areencouraging Jesus to eat  lunch. In his typical way, Jesus changes their whole way of seeingthings.          31 In the meanwhile the disciples wererequesting Him, saying,    Rabbi, eat. 32 But He said to them, I havefood to eat that you do not    know about. 33 The disciples therefore were saying to oneanother, No one    brought Him anything to eat, did he? 34 Jesus said tothem, My food is to do    the will of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.         They say, Jesus, it&#146;s past lunchtime. Eat, something.  And Jesus says, I&#146;ve been eating. My food is to do thewill of my Father and to  accomplish his work. So I just spent the last half hour talking toa Samaritan woman about  her need for salvation. And I&#146;ll tell you, brothers, I amfull.     So Jesus shakes up our world again here. We areconcerned about the  nourishment that comes from eating. He is concerned about thenourishment that comes from  loving. Jesus gets strength and satisfaction from witnessing tothe all-satisfying water  of life. There is a reason for this. When we give ourselves to thework of personal  evangelism and world missions, God pours more life into our souls.In giving life away to  others, God pours life into us. The more you share God the moreyou savor God.    Jesus said it was his food to do this work. Howcan energy-expending  work be energy-giving food? I believe it&#146;s because, when youjoin your hand to  God&#146;s favorite enterprise, there is a special provision fromthe Lord. The very doing  of the work of evangelism puts you into such intimate communionwith the heart of God that  giving becomes getting. Feeding becomes eating. Missions is a wayof nourishing your soul  on God. That&#146;s the change in our way of seeing the world thatGod wants to make this  morning.    Another way to say it is that reaffirming thevision of   2000 by  2000   is a way of corporate feeding on God. How shall we asa church say, Our  food is to do the will of him who sent us and to accomplish hiswork? In 1990 we  believe God called us to set a prayer goal of leading 2000 peopleto faith and sending  2000 of our people out from us. When the Master Planning Teamsought the Lord about our  vision at mid-decade we had no sense at all that God was backingoff on this call, nor  that we should back off on this goal, but rather a strong sensethat we should reaffirm  the prayer goals of 2000 by 2000. Therefore page 7 of the Missionbooklet says, To  spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for thejoy of all peoples, we  gladly embrace with fresh zeal the sending and harvesting goals of2000 by 2000.    The detailed explanation and background of thisvision are given on  page 10 of the Mission booklet and in the blue folder in yourbulletin.     Sowing and Harvesting in the Kingdom     This is missions week and the focus formost of this week is on  sending and the crossing of cultures to win people to Christ andto plant churches. What  Jesus says next in this text is a call to see the world of sendingand harvesting, sowing  and reaping a very different way than we usually do. Look at John4:35-38.          Do you not say, There are yet fourmonths, and then comes the    harvest? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and lookon the fields, that they    are white for harvest. 36 Already he who reaps is receivingwages, and is gathering fruit    for life eternal; that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoicetogether. 37 For in this    case the saying is true, One sows, and anotherreaps. 38 I sent you to reap    that for which you have not labored; others have labored, andyou have entered into their    labor.        In ordinary harvesting there is sowing time andthere is reaping time  and the interval between the two is fixed. There is no point inlifting up your eyes on  July 4 in Minnesota to see if the corn is ready to be picked. Knee-high by the fourth of  July, and that&#146;s that. But not so in the spiritual realm.Jesus says, in verse 35,  You say, there are four months till harvest. You thinkof fixed and  unchangeable times between sowing and reaping. But that is not theway I want you to look  at the world of missions. Don&#146;t be mechanistic. Don&#146;tthink that there is some  fixed pattern or timing that always holds. Don&#146;t sow and thengo back to your  ordinary tasks with no expectancy. Instead, I say, lift up youreyes. Be on the lookout.  There are fields white and ready to harvest.    He had just been sowing the seed of the wordduring the last half hour.  The Samaritan woman, full of wonderment had gone to sow some morein the town. And the  problem was now: would the disciples lift up their eyes to whatGod was doing, or would  they just go about their business worrying about lunch? Jesus wassaying, contrary to all  your expectations, this town, where you just went to buy lunch,and saw nothing, is in  fact a field white unto harvest.    The point is this: in the realm of missions andevangelism, don&#146;t  be locked into fixed natural laws. Don&#146;t say, Fourmonths, then . . .  because that&#146;s the way its always been. Instead lift up youreyes. Lift up your eyes.  Look. See what God is doing. Get on the Missions Internet networksand look. Look on the  world with the eyes of Jesus. There are people and peoplesreaching harvest time all  around us and all around the world. Don&#146;t be fatalistic ormechanistic. Lift up your  eyes and see that God is readying harvest all the time. Not justafter four months.      But here is another difference between the wayJesus looks at harvest  and the way we usually do. Ordinarily in farming the same farmerwho sows the seed also  gathers the harvest. But in the work of the kingdom that is often,I would say usually,  not the case. Look at verse 37:             For in this  case  thesaying is true, One    sows, and another reaps. 38 I sent you to reap that forwhich you have not labored;    others have labored, and you have entered into theirlabor.          Others labored and didn&#146;t harvest. Youdidn&#146;t labor in sowing  but harvested.    I think what Jesus has in mind here is that hehas just sowed the seed  of the word, and the woman is now sowing it in Samaria, and Johnthe Baptist has sowed  seed here, and the prophets and Moses have sowed seed throughtheir writings. But now  Jesus is sending his disciples to enter into that harvest forwhich they have not sowed at  all.     That is the way it is in the history ofmissions, and in the work of  our missionaries today. Some fields are fields mainly of sowingand not reaping; other  fields are ripe for harvest. In the first category I would put,for example, Japan and  Guinea and Thailand. Here the sowing goes on and the fruit ispicked one at a time without  a great season of harvest -- yet. In the other category I wouldput Kazakhstan and Siberia  and China. The seed was sown for a hundred years in China and whenthe missionaries were  removed in the late 1940&#146;s there may have been a millionChristians. Today, I just  read a revised estimate last week, there may be 134 millionChristians in China today. The  sowers were not the reapers of the great harvest.    In a distant land today, where Brian and DeannaPratt are and where we will  commission the Aaslands to tonight, there is an amazing season ofharvest. The September  letter said that there was another harvest event with80 new believers coming  into the kingdom. There are almost 500 believers attending thecelebration on Sundays,  most of whom have come to Christ in the last two years.      But the point for us is this: just as we mustnot be mechanistic in  assuming that there have to be four months between sowing andharvesting, even so we must  not assume that every sower will be a reaper. Verses 37 and 38 area warning against that  and an encouragement to our missionaries to press on: one sows andanother reaps, and the  reapers come and usually enter into the labor of another.    One last observation. God means for missions tobe a joyful work. It is   spreading a passion for the supremacy of God in all things forthe  joy  of all  peoples.  Verse 36: Already he who reaps is receivingwages (or: reward), and is  gathering fruit for life eternal; that he who sows and he whoreaps   may rejoice  together  . God means for our missionaries to be gladin their work, whether  they are sowing or whether they are reaping.     But what if the sowing is not followedimmediately by reaping? Then how  will the one who sows rejoice with the one who reaps? The answeris faith. Tremendous  faith in future grace -- . . . abounding in the work of theLord,  knowing that  your toil is not in vain in the Lord.  (1 Cor. 15:58).Faith must lift up its  eyes into the future and see the harvest and rejoice. We call it,A vision for  harvest.    God means this work to be a  joyful  work.But it is not an  easy   work. Or a  safe  work. With long seasons of sowing thereis an immense battle  with discouragement -- to keep on believing that the investment ofa life in sowing is  worth the sacrifices. And with high seasons of harvesting there isan immense battle with  opposition -- family strife, sickness, demonic manifestations,political resistance,  persecution, team disagreements -- all of that to both sowers andreapers. Whether our  missionaries are sowing or reaping, the battles are immense.    And I want to close this morning by calling usto pray over those of  you are on your way to missionary service or are in missionaryservice or sense that God  might be calling you to cross-cultural kingdom service. Would youcome and let me pray  over you, and for those who have gone out from us.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
