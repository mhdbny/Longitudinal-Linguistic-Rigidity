       THE NEW COVENANT AND THE NEW COVENANT PEOPLE    (1 Corinthians 11:17-34)        But in giving this instruction, I do not praise      you, because you come together not for the better but for the      worse. For, in the first place, when you come together as a      church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part, I      believe it. For these must also be factions among you, in order      that those who are approved may have become evident among you.      Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's      Supper, for in your eating each one takes his own supper first;      and one is hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have      houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church      of God, and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to      you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you. For I      received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that      the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took      bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said,      "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of      Me." In the same way He took the cup also, after supper,      saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as      often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me." For as often as      you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's      death until He comes. Therefore whoever eats this bread or      drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be      guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man      examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of      the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment      to himself, if he does not judge the body rightly. For this      reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.      But if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.      But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord in order      that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my      brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.      If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you may not      come together for judgment. And the remaining matters I shall      arrange when I come.         Instead of a detailed exposition of this passage I want us to   see only two main things. One is that the Lord's Supper is a   celebration of how Jesus established the new covenant. And the   other is that this new covenant creates and controls the existence   of local churches.       The first point is made explicit in  verse 25: "In the same   way He took the cup also, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the   new covenant in my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in   remembrance of me.'"  So each time we drink the cup of the   Lord's Supper we are to remember that the shedding of the blood of   Jesus is how the new covenant was established. "This cup is the   new covenant in (or by) my blood".       The new covenant was prophesied in Jeremiah 31:        "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when      I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the      house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their      fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the      land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, though I was their      husband, says the LORD. But this is the covenant which I will      make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD:      I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their      hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. .      . &#91;and&#93; I will forgive their iniquity, and I will      remember their sin no more."          So the new covenant is God's pledge to forgive the sins of his   people and to put his laws within us and to write them on our   hearts, and to be our God and to make us his people.       The new covenant is not a mere possibility; it is a new   creation. It is something not merely that God proposes, but   something that he accomplishes. It is the creation of a people for   God who will not forsake him. They will be his people and he will   be their God for ever. The certainty of it lies not in them, but   in God's covenant commitment: he says that he will forgive their   sins and remember their iniquity no more. And he says that he will   write his laws this time not just on tablets of stone, but on   tablets of the heart.       So the two problems that separate people from God are solved in   the new covenant. 1) The first is the problem of guilt because of   sin (which Jesus solves by shedding his blood to lift our guilt by   taking it on himself--"I will forgive their iniquity"--"this cup   is the new covenant in my blood"). 2) The other problem is   rebellion--our tendency to run away from God and follow the   destructive suggestions of the world (which God solves by writing   his law on our hearts so that it is not just his will imposed from   outside, but it is his will experienced from the inside as our own   will).       Another way of promising the new covenant was made by Moses in   Deuteronomy 30:6, "And the Lord your God will circumcise your   heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the   Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you   may live." In the new covenant "thou shalt love the Lord your God"   is not just a command, it is also a gift.       Ezekiel 36:27 puts the new covenant commitment of God like   this: "I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my   statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances." In the new   covenant the allegiance of the human partner in the covenant is   not left in question. God secures it--with the infinite worth of   his Son's blood and with the infinite power of his own Spirit.       The connection between the new covenant, and the death of   Jesus, and the working of God in the hearts of his people to cause   them to walk in his ways is made explicit in Hebrews 13:20-21.        Now may the God of peace who brought again from      the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep by the      blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good      that you may do his will, working in you that which is pleasing      in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever      and ever. Amen.          There it is: the blood of Christ, the eternal covenant, and God   fulfilling the new covenant promise to work in us what is pleasing   in his sight.       So the first point from today's text is simply to say that the   Lord's Supper is a celebration of how Jesus established the new   covenant--by shedding his blood for his people and thus securing   for them the forgiveness of their sins and the sanctification of   their souls.       That's why the hymn writer sings, "His oath, his covenant, his   blood support me in the whelming flood." It may be that in my   covenant relationship with God I will take an oath of allegiance,   and make covenant vows, and shed my blood. But none of that--none   of my deeds--is my hope and stay. My hope is that behind and   underneath all of that is a massive divine initiative that chose   me, and predestined me and bought me, and called me, and raised me   from the dead, and justified me, and put his Spirit within me, and   wrote his law on my heart, and is working in me that which is   pleasing in his sight, and will glorify me just as surely as his   Son's blood is of infinite value. That's what supports me in the   whelming flood. When all around my soul gives way, he then--he and   his oath and his covenant commitment, and his blood, and his   sovereign, irresistible, covenant initiative--is all my hope and   stay.       That's the first point: the Lord's Supper celebrates that new   covenant and its establishment in the death of Jesus.       The second point is that this new covenant creates and controls   the existence of local churches. I stress "local churches" here   not to deny the importance of the universal church--the people of   God in all ages and all places. That's true. The new covenant   establishes a people of God much larger than any one local church   or denomination. When God says in Jeremiah 31:33, "I will be their   God and they will be my people," he means that the new covenant   will establish one great people of God.       But I stress the fact that the new covenant creates and   controls "local churches" because that is the application that   Paul makes here in the letter to the local church in Corinth.       Notice verse 18: "In the first place, when you come together as   a church, I hear that divisions exist among you." When you come   together "as a church." Here "church" is not the universal body of   Christ. This is not the people of God in all places and all times.   This is the people of God gathered in one place for worship and   ministry. This is what we call a "local church."       This means that God wills for the new covenant to create local   churches. The covenant promise, "You will be my people and I will   be your God," does not just create a universal body, but local   expressions of that body in specific local gatherings called   churches.       Paul is wrestling here with the misbehavior of a local church.   The rich were bringing their food to the love feast before the   Lord's Supper and were eating and getting drunk with no care for   the poor who didn't have any food to bring (v.21). He rebukes them   in verse 22 and says at the end of the verse: "Shall I praise you?   In this I will not praise you." And then he brings in the words of   the Lord's Supper as an argument for why they should not be acting   this way as God's people: "For I received from the Lord that which   I also delivered to you. . ."       The "for" shows that he is giving the reason or basis for why   they should not act in this unloving way. And the basis he gives   is a reminder of what the Lord's Supper is: "This cup is the new   covenant in my blood."       In other words the local church is not only created by the new   covenant, (I will be their God...I will write my law on their   hearts) it is also controlled by the new covenant. The nature of   the new covenant shapes the nature of the community it creates.   People who are bought with the blood of Jesus, people who have the   law of God written on their hearts don't pig out on their own   riches and get drunk while others in the church have nothing and   go hungry.       The new covenant, secured and sealed by the blood of Jesus,   creates the people of God and controls the people of God. And   since it is God's purpose that there be local churches as   expressions of that universal body of Christ, we may say just as   surely that the new covenant creates those churches and controls   them.       In other words when a local number of believers comes together   to form a church they are to think something like this; we are   bound to God by the new covenant; and not only that, since we are   bound to God by that covenant, we are bound to each other by that   covenant too. The covenant that makes us belong to God, makes us   belong to each other. Therefore our commitment to each other in a   local church is a covenant commitment. Our covenant relationship   to God implies a covenant relationship to each other. God's   covenant with us creates and shapes our covenant with each other.       This is the Biblical and theological basis of the church   covenant that you see printed in the worship folder this morning.   This covenant was written almost exactly as we have it here by J.   Newton Brown about 1853, and became one of the most widely used   covenants among baptists. The historical record of church   covenants goes all the way back to the beginning of congregational   and baptist life on the European continent in the early 1500's.       The Bible does not say explicitly, "Thou shalt have a written   church covenant," any more than it says, "Thou shalt have marriage   licenses," or "Thou shalt have wedding rings." But for those   believers who are persuaded that churches are to be governed   congregationally rather than through district presbyteries or   diocesan bishops, the Biblical reality of the new covenant leads   necessarily to a church covenant as the basis of our local   commitment to each other and to God in the form of a church.       A bishop's rule does not make Bethlehem a church; a   presbytery's vote does not make us a church. What makes us a   church is our covenant. We are a church because we come together   and, with common commitments, we pledge to be the church for each   other and for the world and for the glory of God. Charles Deweese,   who has written the most recent historical study of church   covenants defines the church covenant like this:       A church covenant &#91;is&#93; a series of written      pledges based on the Bible which church members voluntarily      make to God and to one another regarding their basic moral and      spiritual commitments and the practice of their      faith. 1         One way to look at it is that a church without a covenant is   like a marriage without vows. Marriage vows are not spelled out in   the Bible just like church covenants aren't. Both follow   necessarily from the nature of the relationships.       This doesn't mean that you shouldn't ever leave a local church.   The bride of Christ is greater than Bethlehem. It means rather   that while we are members of this church we are members of it by   covenant--the new covenant creating a new people gathering in a   local church with a covenant commitment to God and to each other.       Nor does the church covenant mean that you have to make the   covenant pledge in order to worship here and be ministered to   here. There are sometimes good reasons why a person does not yet   make that covenant commitment.       But even though people must often come and go, and even though   some are among us loved and cared about but not able to make the   covenant with us, nevertheless Bethlehem exists as a definable,   durable, accountable church by virtue of a covenant that the body   makes with each other and with God.       It begins like this,       Having been led, as we believe, by the Spirit of God,      to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior, and, on the      profession of our faith, having been baptized in the name of      the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we do now, in      the presence of God, angels and this assembly, most solemnly      and joyfully enter into covenant with one another as one body      in Christ. 2         In response to God's sovereign initiative ("Having been led by   the Spirit of God")--in response to God's new covenant   initiative--that act of covenanting is the essence of our church.   We will spend the next four Sunday mornings and two Sunday   evenings unpacking its contents.       May the Lord give us a deep and joyful grasp of its meaning for   our life together, and prepare us to reaffirm it together on March   7.
