    the ancient saints were given with Job, to ordering their cause before God. As a petitioner coming into court does not come there without thought to state his case on the spur of the moment, but enters into the audience chamber with his suit well prepared, having also learned how he ought to behave himself in the presence of the great one to whom he is appealing, so it is well to approach the seat of the King of Kings as much as possible with premeditation and preparation, knowing what we are about, where we are standing, and what it is which we desire to obtain ("Effective Prayer, " Gospel Mission, p. 4).        Then he gave a personal word which also rang true with my experience. He said,       The best prayers I have ever heard in our prayer meetings have been those which have been fullest of argument. Sometimes my soul has been fairly melted down where I have listened to the brethren who have come before God feeling the mercy to be really needed, and that they must have it, for they first pleaded with God to give it for this reason, and then for a second, and then for a third and then for a fourth and a fifth until they have awakened the fervency of the entire assembly ("Effective Prayer,"  p. 10).       Ever since reading this sermon by Spurgeon I have become more and more conscious of how the saints of Scripture prayed this way. Especially some of the Psalms show David filling his mouth with arguments toward God. I think we will get a lot of help for our prayer life if we look at one of these prayers, namely Psalm 143.     I would like us to try to answer three questions from this Psalm. 1) What did David want? 2) How did he propose to get it? 3) How did he argue with God?     First, what did David want? The best way to answer this is to assemble all his requests and see if they fall into similar categories. There are about fifteen requests:        vs 1:     hear my prayer, O Lord       give ear to my supplication       answer me      vs 2:     enter not into judgment with Thy servant      vs 7:     answer me       hide not Your face from me      vs 8:     let me hear in the morning of Your steadfast love       teach me the way I should go      vs 9:      deliver me from my enemies       vs 10:     teach me to do Thy will       let Thy good spirit lead me on a level path      vs 11:     preserve my life       bring me out of trouble      vs 12:     cut off my enemies        destroy all my adversaries           When we try to group these, they fall into three categories. The first is the general desire to be heard and answered as in verse one and verse seven: "Hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications, answer me." David wants God first of all simply to be open to hearing his more specific requests. If God's face is turned away, ignoring David, then all his supplications and arguments are in vain.     All the other requests fall into two groups, David's desire for safety and his desire for godliness. His desire for godliness is seen in verse 8: "Cause me to know the way I should go," and verse 10: "Teach me to do Your will ... lead me on a level path." There is a great lesson here for us, namely, whenever we plead with God for some material or physical blessing, we should always include an earnest prayer for our own moral and spiritual transformation. David's life was endangered and he was crying out for protection and preservation. But sheer existence, the hunger to stay alive, did not so dominate David's mind that he forgot the point of living. Why go on living? For the believer earthly life is not an end in itself. There are reasons to live which justify the desire to stay alive and one of those reasons is to do God's will, to walk in the way God has appointed (vv. 8,10). So David does not merely plead for escape and safety. He pleads for God to teach him and lead him in a "land of uprightness" (which is how verse 10b can be translated). He doesn't just want to live, he wants to live for God.     You can measure your spiritual temperature by whether your prayers are richly seasoned with expressions of longing for your own growth in godliness. Do you plead with God to make you more joyful, more loving, more patient, more kind, more gentle, more earnest, more disciplined, etc.? Or do you only pray that He get you out of this and that financial pinch or sickness or predicament at work. If so, call to mind that God did not create us and redeem us merely to live and live well off; He created and redeemed us to be holy as He is holy, to walk in His good will and so bring glory to Him. So let's be like David and every time we hunger for life and safety, let's express just as much longing to God that we desire spiritual vitality and godliness just as much as life itself.     The other group of requests in this Psalm all come under the category of pleas for safety. First, safety from human enemies: verse 9: "Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies"; verses 11-12: "O Lord, preserve my life ... bring me out of trouble … cut off all my enemies and destroy all my adversaries." David was a great warrior and no doubt often from the early days when Saul was after him to the end of his fighting career he was beset by enemies who wanted to eliminate him from the scene. And even in times of apparent peace there was the danger of intrigue within his own courts. Remember his own son Absalom tried to steal the hearts of the people away from David.     How can we go on functioning when we know that there are hostile forces surrounding us who may from time to time break in and do us harm? Won't this rob us of all peace and put us always on edge and make us tense? Yes, it will, until we have sought God like David and prayed earnestly and argued our way before Him into His peace.     You may think such a prayer for deliverance from enemies has little to do with your tranquil life in safe, suburban America. And it is true that few of us run the risks with human enemies which David did. But there are hostilities that arise at work and in the neighborhood which could result in abuse. Mary Stauffer probably never dreamed that hostilities against her could linger for fifteen years and then break in against her like they did.     But lest we nevertheless content ourselves that hostile enmity is really not part of our experience, let's remember what Jesus taught His disciples to pray: "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." We all have an enemy whose hostility against us never ceases and who is bent on our real destruction, that is, the destruction of our faith. So when we read these Psalms it would not be contrary to their spirit if we remember our arch-enemy, the evil one, and then pray that God would deliver us from his power and destroy all his forces. Then we can sing with Martin Luther:      And though this world with devils filled  Should threaten to undo us, We will not fear for God has willed  His truth to triumph through us.      The prince of darkness grim, We tremble not for him. His rage we can endure For, lo, his doom is sure, One little word shall fell him.        But there is another person from whose enmity David seeks to escape; he seeks to escape the judgment of God. Verse 2: "Enter not into judgment with thy servant." David not only needs a place of protection from his human adversary, he also needs protection from his divine adversary. But where can you flee from the judgment of God?     That brings us to the second question we want to answer, namely, How does David propose to get the godliness and the safety that he wants? The obvious answer is by prayer. This simple fact is especially encouraging to me because David was a great man; we know he was handsome and strong and wise and sensitive and often had lots of human power at his disposal. Yet David unhesitatingly takes on the role of a beggar before God. That is encouraging for me because if David did not have to do that then I might get the idea that God requires us all to have the strength and beauty of David in order to overcome our problems. But in fact king David can only pray. But prayer is something all of us can do no matter how homely or weak or slow-witted we are. So it is a great encouragement when we see David submitting to prayer to get what he needs.     In answer to the question, Where can you flee from the judgment of God?, there is only one answer which holds out any hope: flee to God. When a little child has disobeyed his father and stirred up his anger, he has got two possibilities. He can run out the back door, which is hopeless not just because his father is faster but because in the father's house are the food and clothing the child needs to live. The other possibility is to run into his father's arms and squeeze his neck and plead for mercy. The only escape from the judgment of God is in the mercy of God. And this is where David flees. In God there is escape from all adversaries including God. Never try to run from Him; He is always faster. But even more, with Him alone is fullness of joy and pleasures forever.     But there is a surprising use of language in Psalm 143 which makes me think I better qualify my statement that the only escape from the judgment of God is the mercy of God. This surprising use of language jumps out right away as soon as we ask our third and final question: How does David argue his case before God? Or to put it another way, On what basis does he presume to ask God for godliness and for safety?     The surprising thing in verses 1 and 2 is that David does not first flee to God's mercy to escape his judgment. He flees to God's righteousness. "In thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness! Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for no man living is righteous before Thee." Now that sounds backwards. If no one is righteous before God, including me, then isn't it suicidal to ask God to answer us in righteousness? It would be, if divine righteousness meant only His strict adherence to a law of distributive justice according to which every person gets strictly what he deserves. But this can't be the meaning of righteousness in verse 1. David the sinner would never plead for God to act in His righteousness if righteousness meant giving a person only what he deserves.     What does it mean then? Well, it is used back to back with God's faithfulness: "In thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness." Perhaps then, God's righteousness is His doing right by His promises to which He is always faithful. Surely it is right of God to keep His covenant with David and with the Israelites in general. But my problem with this solution is that in all the arguments David gives for why God should help him, he never explicitly appeals to the covenant or to a promise.      To see this, let's list all the arguments David assembles, or all the bases on which he appeals for help.        vs. 1:     in your faithfulness        in your righteousness       vs. 2:      for no one living is righteous before you       vs. 3:     for the enemy has pursued me       he has crushed my life to the ground       he has made me sit in darkness      vs. 4:     my spirit faints within me       my heart is appalled      vs. 7:     my spirit is failing        lest I be like those who go down to the pit       vs. 8:     for in thee I put my trust        for to thee I lift up my soul       vs. 9:     I have fled to thee for refuge (covered myself in you)      vs 10:     for thou art my God      vs 11:     for thy name's sake        in thy righteousness       vs 12:     in thy steadfast love (mercy)        for I am thy servant.
