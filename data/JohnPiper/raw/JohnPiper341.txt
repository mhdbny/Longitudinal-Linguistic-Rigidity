 January 26, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       EXPOSING THE DARK WORK OF ABORTION    (Ephesians 5:11)         "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness,    but instead expose them."         I begin this morning by making sure that we understand the   difference between a Christian call to pro-life action and a   non-Christian call to pro-life action. I am glad that   non-Christians are calling for an end to abortion. I am glad that   there are "atheists for life." One of the things that makes   America work is that what Christians see as right behavior because   of Christ non-Christians see as right for other reasons.        This is not surprising. Some of the truth that is rooted in   Jesus as the Son of God is also revealed partially in creation.   The law written on the heart of all men and women (Romans 2:14),   no matter how marred by sin, is still God's law. So there is   always hope that in the gracious providence of God believers and   non-believers in a pluralistic society might come to agree that   certain behaviors are right and certain behaviors are wrong.        But I am a Christian pastor, not a politician. My main job is   not to unite believers and unbelievers behind worthwhile causes.   Somebody should do this. But that is not my job. Some of you ought   to be doing that with a deep sense of Christian calling. My job is   to glorify Jesus Christ by calling his people to be distinctively   Christian in the way they live their lives.        Therefore I begin by showing you from Scripture (not from   natural law, as crucial as that is for social survival) what is   distinctively Christian in my call to pro-life action.        A Christian call to pro-life action is a call to the children   of light to be what you are in Christ. This is utterly crucial to   grasp if you want to act as a Christian. Let me give you four   instances of what I mean from this text.        Let's start in the verse just before our text--the last verse   of Ephesians 4 (v.32), "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,   forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you." A Christian   call to forgive does not say: forgive in order to earn the   forgiveness of God. It says forgive because you have been forgiven   by God. Look at the last half of verse 32: "Forgive one another as   God in Christ forgave you." Christian living moves from what God   has freely done for us in Christ to what we should freely do for   others. It is not the other way around.        A second example is in verse 1 of chapter 5: "Be imitators of   God as beloved children." It does not say, "Be imitators of God in   order to get adopted." It begins with your standing in Christ as   "loved children." To as many as received Christ to them God gave   authority to be children of God" (John 1:12). So the Christian   call to imitate God in the world is not a call to earn a standing   with him, but a call to be what you are--chips off the old block,   loved children of God. Loved children love to be like their   father.        A third example is verse 2: "Walk in love, as Christ loved us   and gave himself up for us." It does not say, "Walk in love so   that Christ will start loving us and give himself up for us." It   says Christ loved us and gave himself for us, therefore walk in   love. Be what he has died to make you, and secured for you.        A fourth example is in verse 8: "Once you were darkness, but   now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of the light." It   does not say, "Be the light of the world so that you can become   children of the light." It says, "You ARE light in the Lord. You   ARE no longer darkness. You are children of the light. Walk as   what you are."        This is the difference between a Christian call to pro-life   action and a non-Christian call. The call to forgive, the call to   imitate God, the call to walk in love, the call to walk as   children of the light--these are calls rooted in something that   God in Christ has done for us. They are rooted in what God has   already made us in Christ. They are calls to be what we are   because of God's forgiveness, God's adoption, Christ's sacrificial   love and God's putting his light within us.        All of that happens to you when you become a Christian by   putting your trust in Jesus as Savior and Lord of your life. The   rest of the story is: become what you are! Forgive--out of your   forgivenness. Love--out of your being loved. Shine--with the light   that Christ is in you. So the call to Christian pro-life action is   first a call to conversion--to new birth--to repentance and faith   in Jesus. Then it is a call to let your light shine in the   darkness--to walk as children of the light.        This is why in verse 9 Paul says, "For the fruit of light is   found in all that is good and right and true." Paul calls goodness   and justice and truth the FRUIT of light because it grows   naturally out of light. Fruit comes out of a tree because of what   the tree is. That is the Christian life: becoming what you   are--bearing fruit.        The opposite of the "fruit of light" is "the works of   darkness." Look at verse 11: "Take no part in the fruitless works   of darkness." The opposite of "light" is "darkness" and the   opposite of "fruit" is "works". This is just like Galatians 5   where Paul contrasts the "fruit of the Spirit" and the "works of   the flesh." And the point is the same: true Christian living is   essentially fruit-bearing, not essentially working. It is   essentially letting the fruit show what the tree is like. It is   not working to become a tree.        We become a tree and stay a sound tree by trusting in the free   mercy of God and all that he is for us in Jesus. The Christian   life--with all its pro-life action and everything else that is   good--is being what we are, God-forgiven, God-adopted,   Christ-loved, fruit-bearing trees.        Now on that basis consider the distinctively Christian call to   pro-life action. Verse 8b says, "Walk as children of the light."   Verse 11 gives a negative and a positive way to do that.   Negatively: "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but   rather (this is the positive part:) expose them." Walking in the   light means not doing works of darkness and it means exposing the   works of darkness that others do.        Therefore we learn from this text that Christians who walk in   the light should be involved in exposing the dark and fruitless   work of abortion. It is a dark and barren work, and we are called   to expose it.        The word "expose" is used again in verse 13 where you get a   clear idea of what's involved: "When anything is exposed by the   light it becomes visible." The idea is that when we "walk as   children of the light" we will shine into places of darkness and   cause the darkness to become visible, or to become light. Or to   use the words of Jesus, when we let our light shine before men the   dark works of men become shown for what they really are: fruitless   and shameful. That's part of our calling.        In John 3:20 we see this word again. Jesus says, "Every one who   does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest   his deeds should be exposed." So the point behind this word is   that Christians are called to shine the light of truth and justice   and love into the darkness and bring evil to light for what it   really is.        Another way to say this is that God calls his people to be the   conscience of the culture. Our individual conscience probes into   our behavior and either approves or disapproves what we do. So the   children of light are to probe into the life of their culture and   approve or disapprove what it does.        I hope you hear the force of this. It is radically different   from the passivity and moral withdrawal of many Christians. Many   believers have a passive avoidance ethic and that is all. In other   words they think: if I avoid the works of darkness, and don't do   them myself, then I am doing my Christian duty. I'm clean. I'm in   the light. But that is not what verse 11 says. It says you are   only doing half your duty. "Take no part in the fruitless works of   darkness"--that's an avoidance ethic. That's half your duty. But   it goes on, and in fact puts stress on the next phrase because it   is easily overlooked and because it can be very costly: "Rather   even expose them!" Don't just avoid the works of darkness, EXPOSE   them. This is not avoidance. This is action.        Do you hear a call to action in this verse? Do you hear a call   to do something in 1992 to expose the darkness and the   fruitlessness (the barrenness!) of abortion? God is calling us in   this verse--he is calling all Christians--to expose the dark and   fruitless work of abortion . . .        1 -- to expose the fact that there are 1.5 million abortions a   year in America every year--27 million since the Supreme Court   overturned the public conscience of 48 states 19 years ago.        2 -- to expose the fact that 30% of all babies conceived in   America are killed by abortion.        3 -- to expose the fact that medically women are told not to   have abortions before the 7th week of pregnancy (see the Yes/Neon   booklet), and yet by the 8th week the heart of the baby has been   beating for a month, there are measurable brain waves, there is   response to touch, there's thumb-sucking, grasping with the hands,   swimming with the arms in the amniotic fluid, distinct arms and   legs and sexual organs. This much must--not may, must--be present   before most abortion centers will cut the baby to pieces with a   suction machine 4,000 times a day.        4 -- to expose the fact that 9,000 babies were killed after the   21st week of pregnancy in 1987, fully formed and on the brink of   being able to breathe for themselves--killed, legally!        5 -- to expose the fact that in Minnesota we have a fetal   homicide law that makes it "murder to kill an embryo or fetus   intentionally, except in cases of abortion"--in other words, it's   unlawful to kill the unborn child unless the mother chooses to   have it killed. And that is a strange and dark criterion for   lawful killing.        6 -- to expose the fact that "There is inescapable   schizophrenia in aborting a perfectly normal 22 week fetus while   at the same hospital, performing intra-uterine surgery on its   cousin" (Steve Calvin).        7 -- to expose the fact that viability outside the womb is not   a criterion of personhood and right to life, because we ourselves   don't want to give up our personhood and our right to life if we   must be sustained on a respirator or dialysis machine the way a   baby has to be sustained by a placenta.        8 -- to expose the fact that the size and reasoning power of a   tiny person is irrelevant to human personhood because if it were   we might allow tiny and unthinking newborns to be killed.        9 -- to expose the fact that genetically human embryos and   fetuses are utterly different from all other animal life; if they   are just left alone, with nothing added but nourishment they will   grow up.        10 -- to expose the fact that if it is unlawful to crush the   egg of a bald eagle, it is not excessively restrictive to make it   unlawful to crush the egg of a human.        11 -- to expose the fact that when two legitimate rights   conflict--the right not to be pregnant and the right not to be   killed--justice demands that we give place to the greater right,   the right that does the least harm--the one that does not   willfully kill.        12 -- to expose the fact that there are thousands of crisis   pregnancy centers in this country ready to help, and almost all of   them are free--unlike the abortion mills that charge plenty of   money--and the older the baby, the more they charge.        13 -- to expose the fact that there are no unwanted babies in   Minnesota. Mary Ann Kuharsky (President of ProLife Minnesota) said   in the Tribune she would take any baby whose life depended on it,   and there are hundreds like her.        14 -- to expose the fact that it is hypocritical to speak as   though choice were the untouchable absolute in this matter and   then turn around and oppose choice in matters of gun-control and   welfare support and affirmative action and minimum wage and dozens   of other issues where so-called pro-choice people join the demand   that people's choices be limited to protect others. It's a sham   argument. All choices are limited by life.        15 -- to expose the fact that trespassing to save life is not a   crime and that it does not undermine our legal system but on the   contrary endorses the one foundation stone without which that   legal system in this land will fall, namely the inalienable right   to life. There will be no law but the law of individual choice   (=anarchy) if the foundations stone of life's value is destroyed.   And abortion is destroying it.        God is calling passive, inactive Christians today to engage our   minds and hearts and hands in exposing the barren works of   darkness. To be the conscience of our culture. To be the light of   the world. To live in the great reality of being loved by God and   adopted by God and forgiven by Christ (yes--for all the abortions   that dozens of you have had), and to made children of the light. I   call you this morning to walk as children of light.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
