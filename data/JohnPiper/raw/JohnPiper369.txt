       ASK WHATEVER YOU WISH    (John 15:7)        If you abide in me and my words abide in you,       ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.         Our focus this morning is verse 7, "If you abide in me and my   words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done   for you." The verse has two halves, a condition and a result. The   condition--the if clause--is "If you abide in me and my words   abide in you . . ." The result--the then clause--"then ask   whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."       Last week we talked about the condition--especially the meaning   of Jesus' words abiding in us. If we are to have consistent   answers to prayer, the words of Jesus must abide in us. That is,   as we saw from verses 4 and 5, Jesus himself must abide in us   speaking. We do not just stock ourselves with dead ideas which he   spoke once, but we receive and believe and remember and meditate   on the truths that he spoke once and is speaking now as he abides   in us.       Today I want to focus on the result clause of verse 7--"ask   whatever you wish, and it will be done for you." If the words of   Jesus abide in us, then the result will be that you pray with   power and effectiveness.       There are four truths about prayer that come from meditating on   this verse in its wider context in the writings of John.       1. Prayer is for fruit-bearing.       God designed prayer to give his disciples the joy of bearing   fruit while God himself gets the glory. We can see this in the   connection between verses 7 and 8 and then in verse 16.        If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask      whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you. (v. 8) By this      is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove      to be my disciples.         In John's way of writing the phrase "by this" at the beginning   of verse 8 probably refers backward to verse 7 and forward to the   rest of verse 8. "By this is my Father glorified"--that is, by   your asking him for things and his giving them to you. He gets   glory as the one who is rich and good enough to answer prayer. But   also . . . "By this is my Father glorified"--that is, that you   bear much fruit. The implication is that God gets glory when we   bear much fruit because we have prayed and God has answered.   Therefore the primary point of prayer is fruit-bearing. Prayer is   for fruit-bearing.       This is confirmed explicitly in verse 16. Jesus says to his   disciples, "You did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed   you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should   remain, that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he may   give to you."       The logical connection between the two parts of this verse are   tremendously important. Jesus says that he chose and appointed his   disciples that they should go and bear fruit that remains . . .   "that (in order that) whatever you ask of the Father in my name,   he may give it to you." Shortened down it says, "I have given you   a fruit-bearing mission in order that your prayers might be   answered! This only makes sense if prayer is for fruit-bearing.       You would expect the verse to be just the reverse: God will   give you what you ask in order that you might have a fruit-bearing   mission. But Jesus says it the other way around: I give you a   fruit bearing mission in order that the Father might answer your   prayers. The point: prayer malfunctions when it is not used in   fruit-bearing. Prayer is for fruit-bearing. Therefore, since I   want you to pray and to get answers to your prayers, I chose you   and I appointed you to go and bear fruit. Because prayer is for   fruit-bearing. If you are not devoted to fruit-bearing you have no   warrant for expecting answers to prayer. Prayer is designed for   fruit-bearing.       2. Prayer is not for gratifying natural desires.       Now I know that Jesus taught us to pray, "Give us this day, our   daily bread." And what could be more natural than the desire to   eat? And I know that there are dozens of instances in the Bible of   people praying for desires as natural as the desire for protection   from enemies and escape from danger and success in vocation and   fertility in marriage, recovery from sickness, etc.       My point is not that those desires are wrong. My point is that   they should always be subordinate to spiritual desires, kingdom   desires, fruit-bearing desires, gospel-spreading, God-centered   desires, Christ-exalting, God-glorifying desires. And when our   natural desires are felt as a means to these greater desires then   they become the proper subject of prayer.       Just before Jesus said to pray, "Give us this day our daily   bread," he said, make it your heart's desire that God would hallow   his name and that the kingdom would come and that the will of God   would be done on earth. When your heart is caught up with those   great desires, then having something to eat is not merely a   natural desire, but a means to some great God-centered end. And   then it is the proper subject of prayer.       Prayer is for God's name and God's kingdom and God's will--it   is for fruit-bearing in all those great things. If our protection,   and our escape from danger, and our eating and having clothes and   houses and lands and education and vocational success leads to   those great God-centered ends (the name of God and kingdom of God   and will of God) then we pray about them with confidence.       This is what David meant when he said in Psalm 37:4, "Delight   yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your   heart." The desires of the heart cease to be merely natural   desires when the heart delights above all else in the Lord.   Delighting in the Lord--in the hallowing of his name and the   seeking of his kingdom and the doing of his will--transforms all   natural desires into God-related desires. They are transposed up   into a different key.       Prayer is not for gratifying natural desires. It is for   fruit-bearing, for the glory of God. Another way of saying it is   this: if you want God to respond to your interests, you must be   devoted to his interests. God is God. He does not run the world by   hiring the consulting firm called Mankind. He lets mankind share   in the running of the world through prayer to the degree that we   consult with him and get our goals and desires in tune with his   purposes.       The evidence for this in the writing of John is 1 John 5:14,   "This is the confidence which we have before him, that, if we ask   anything according to His will, he hears us." Prayer is not for   gratifying our natural desires. It is for gratifying our desires   when those desires have been so purified and so saturated with God   that they coincide with his plans. "If we ask anything according   to his will."       John puts it another way in 1 John 3:22, "Whatever we ask we   receive from him because we keep his commandments and do the   things that are pleasing in his sight." In other words prayer is   not for gratifying natural desires. Prayer is for satisfying the   desires of people who are devoted to God's desires.       James put it yet another way in James 4:3, "You ask and do not   receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend   it on your pleasures." Prayer is not for gratifying natural   desires. Prayer is for fruit-bearing.       If we want to have power and effect in praying, we must devote   ourselves to getting our desires into alignment with the fruit   that God means to produce through us--and that fruit always has to   do with the hallowing of his name and the coming of his kingdom   and the doing of his will the way the angels do it in heaven.       3. The words of Jesus abiding in us prepare us for   fruit-bearing prayer.       If prayer is not for gratifying natural desires but for bearing   fruit for God, the major challenge of prayer is to become the kind   of person who is not dominated by natural desires (to become what   Paul calls a "spiritual person" as opposed to a merely "natural   person" or "carnal person"). The key to praying with power is to   become the kind of persons who do not use God for our ends but are   utterly devoted to being used for his ends.       This is why Jesus says, "If you abide in me and my words abide   in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you." The   words of Jesus abiding in us make us the kind of persons who are   not dominated by natural desires, but are devoted to fruit-bearing   for God's glory.       Let me give you a few examples that show this from John's   writings.       3.1 In 1 John 1:10 he says, "If we say we have not sinned, we   make him a liar, and his word is not in us." If the words of Jesus   were abiding in us we would have known ourselves better--that we   have sinned. The words of Jesus abiding in us is the key to a true   and humble assessment of ourselves that keeps us in line with   God's purposes.       3.2 In John 17:8 Jesus prays, "They have received &#91;my   words&#93; and truly understood that I came forth from thee." In   other words receiving the words of Jesus is the key to a true and   exalted assessment of who Jesus is--the Son of God sent from the   Father. And no one can pray in accord with God's purposes without   a true grasp of who Jesus is in the world and what his purposes   are in coming from the Father.       3.3 In 1 John 2:14b John says, "I have written to you, young   men, because . . . the word of God abides in you, and you have   overcome the evil one." So the words of Jesus abiding in us   triumph over Satan and free us from the deceptions that would put   us at odds with God and make natural desires dominate our lives.       3.4 In John 14:24 Jesus says, "He who does not love me does not   keep my words." So if we keep the words of Jesus--if they abide in   us--they will define for us the path of love. And that is   precisely the path where prayer was designed to bear fruit.       3.5 In John 8:47 Jesus says, "He who is of God hears the words   of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not   of God." In other words if the words of God abide in you, you know   that you are chosen of God (cf. John 8:31). The abiding of Jesus'   words in you is evidence of your election and a ground of your   assurance. And that assurance is indispensable in praying with   faith and hope.       3.6 In John 15:3 Jesus says, "You are already clean because of   the word which I have spoken to you," and in John 17:17 he prays,   "Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth." When the word of   God abides in us we are made clean and holy. And that means: in   line with the fruit-bearing purposes of God.       Other examples could be given, but these are enough to show   that the words of Jesus abiding in us prepare us for fruit-bearing   prayer. It's the word that gives us              a humble view of ourselves, and              an exalted view of Jesus, and              triumph over the devil, and              a knowledge of the path of love, and              the assurance of our election, and              the power of holiness.            In other words it's the abiding word of Jesus that puts us in   tune with the fruit-bearing purposes of God to glorify himself. So   the fourth and final truth about prayer is this:       4. The more we are saturated by the words of Jesus the more our   prayers will be answered.       Or to put it in a rhyme:       More saturated by the word       More surely will our prayers be heard       
        Conclusion        The challenge of prayer in 1993 is the challenge to become the   kind of people who do not live at the level of mere natural   desire, but who live to bear fruit for God--to hallow his name and   seek his kingdom and do his will. And the key to becoming that   kind of person is letting the words of Jesus--the word of God   (John 3:34; 14:10; 17:8)--abide in us. Being filled and saturated   by the words of Scripture brings us so close to the mind of God   that we pray in tune with his purposes and receive whatever we   ask.       I think this is a progressive experience, not a once for all   one. That's why the final point is: the more we are saturated by   the words of Jesus the more our prayers will be answered.        If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask      whatever you will and it shall be done for you.         More saturated by the word       More surely will our prayers be heard       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
