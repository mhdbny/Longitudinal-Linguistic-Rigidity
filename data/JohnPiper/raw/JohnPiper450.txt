    September 17, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     HOW CHRIST ENABLES THE CHURCH    TO UPBUILD ITSELF IN LOVE   (Ephesians 4:4-16)              There  is one bodyand one Spirit, just as    also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, onefaith, one baptism, one    God and Father of all who is over all and through all and inall. But to each one of us    grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.Therefore it says, WHEN    HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HEGAVE GIFTS TO MEN.    (Now this  expression , He ascended,what does it mean except    that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? Hewho descended is Himself    also He who ascended far above all the heavens, that He mightfill all things.) And He    gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some asevangelists, and some as pastors    and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work ofservice, to the building up    of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of thefaith, and of the knowledge    of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of thestature which belongs to the    fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to bechildren, tossed here and there by    waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by thetrickery of men, by craftiness    in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are togrow up in all  aspects     into Him, who is the head,  even  Christ, fromwhom the whole body, being    fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies,according to the proper    working of each individual part, causes the growth of the bodyfor the building up of    itself in love.              Typical American Christians&#146; Church Experience:Organically Flawed?     My aim this morning is to persuade you andplead with you to get  into a small group relationship with other Christians toexperience the fullness of  supernatural church life as the New Testament pictures it.     Sometimes I wonder if the frequency andseriousness of many problems  that Christians face is not owing to the fact that most Christiansin America do not  experience relational, interpersonal, supernatural church life theway the New Testaments  describes it. Psychological problems, marriage problems, parentingproblems, self-identity  problems, financial problems, career problems, loneliness,addictions, phobias, weaknesses  -- I wonder if the epidemic of emotional and psychological woes isnot the symptom of an  organic flaw in the way most Christians experience corporatechurch life.     For most Christians corporate church life is aSunday morning worship  service and that&#146;s all. A smaller percentage add to that aclass of some kind,  perhaps Sunday morning or Wednesday evening in which there is verylittle interpersonal  ministry. Now don&#146;t misunderstand me, I believe in thetremendous value of corporate  worship and I believe that solid teaching times are usuallycrucial for depth and  strength. But you simply can&#146;t read the New Testament insearch of what church life  is supposed to be like and come away thinking that Worshipservices and classes are the  sum total of what church was supposed to be.     The inevitable effect of treating church asworship services and  classes is to make the people of God passive and too dependent onordained experts. And  could it not be that this pervasive relational passivity anddependence of millions of  Christians -- I mean passivity in interpersonal, spiritualministry -- rob us of some of  Christ&#146;s precious remedies for a hundred problems? If Goddesigned the church to  function like a body with every member ministering in the power ofthe Holy Spirit to  other members, in regular interpersonal relationship, then wouldit be surprising to find  that the neglect of this regular interpersonal, spiritual ministrycripples the body in  some of its functions and causes parts of the body to be weak andsick? Isn&#146;t that  what you would expect?    I wonder if the incredible felt need forprofessional psychologists --  with the common assumption: Where else could you possibly turn? --whether this feeling is  owing in large measure to an organic flaw in the way we experiencecorporate church life.  Think about this for a moment. How do psychological counselorshelp people? (And many of  them do!) It seems to boil down to three things: 1) personal oneon one conversations,  called counseling or psychotherapy; 2) personal group meetingswith others facing similar  struggles; and 3) medications, usually some form ofantidepressant. Now I think we can be  thankful for these things in many cases.    But isn&#146;t it amazing that when Christiansare in distress and seek  help from professional psychologists, short of medication, thehelp we get comes through  one on one or group sharing. When confronted with the pain ofpeople&#146;s personal  problems where do professionals turn? They turn first to one-on-one conversation. And when  more is needed they turn to small groups. Isn&#146;t thatremarkable! That the  multi-billion dollar ministry of psychotherapy that we havecreated to help hurting people  is built almost entirely on the ministry of conversation. Theytalk. That is the ministry  -- the power of conversation. In the best settings, wise,insightful, prayerful, loving  conversation.    Someone might conclude from this: So the churchhas failed to provide  for this and should now be providing support groups -- for allkinds of distresses and  abuses. Yes, perhaps so. But the question that is troubling memore these days is more  fundamental than that. I am asking whether generations of flawedorganic church life is a  significant part of the origin of some of our dysfunctions anddistresses. It&#146;s the  difference between asking whether the job of the church is to haveprograms to distribute  vitamin C tablets to remedy a scurvy epidemic, or whether weshould have all the while  been eating oranges.    If I am anywhere close to the truth here, thenwe might ask whether  those who experience church in small groups get victory over theirproblems more often  than those who don&#146;t. Yes, perhaps that would tell ussomething. But the problem is  deeper. Are most of the small groups that exist experiencing whatthe New Testament  pictures as interpersonal, supernatural ministry in the power ofthe Spirit through the  gifts of the Holy Spirit? Let me give you an illustration of whatmay be the case in many  small groups, and plead with you to move toward New Testament lifetogether.         A visiting pastor in Auckland, New Zealandwas asked by the pastor of a    church to come to a small group to help it understand itsfunction. He came early for    dinner and the husband was not there. The wife was embarrassedand explained that the    husband owned a construction company and worked late.       The group arrived after dinner and thevisiting pastor taught for a    while on how to use spiritual gifts to build each other up. Thenhe asked them to get    alone for a few minutes to seek God for how each one mightchannel God&#146;s grace to the    others for their upbuilding.      When they came back together he assumed theyknew each other&#146;s    needs because they had been together for several years. Thehusband came home, showered    and joined them in a few minutes. When the opportunity was givento speak or to pray for    each other there was an awkward silence. They had never doneanything like this before --    seeking the Lord for how he might want them to minister to eachother in that moment to    build each other up.      The visiting pastor felt a fiasco was on hishands and turned the    meeting back to the pastor to close. The pastor asked if anyonehad a special problem they    would like prayer for. The hostess said yes and showed the groupthe rash all over her    arms. She said that the doctors had prescribed medicine but ithadn&#146;t helped. They    invited her to put her chair in the middle for prayer. And asthey prayed, Christ, the    head of the church, did his ministry. The pastor said, Isense in my heart the Lord    is telling me your problem is the result of great anger.      She was silent for a moment then began to crysoftly. Then she    confessed, I am so angry at my husband. He promises to behome for dinner , but    night after night we eat without him. . . . He&#146;s broken hispromises to me over and    over, and I feel I am a widow as I raise our children.      There was an awareness that something hadjust been revealed that two    years of small group meetings had not revealed. And the husbandwas blushing with    embarrassment.      To make the story shorter, several of the menbegan to speak about how    they had wrestled with the same problem in their homes and hadalmost ruined their    marriages. One in particular spoke of a deep meeting with God insuch a crisis and how God    had made everything new.      By the grace of God the husband knelt down infront of his wife and    wept into her lap, as the group prayed for them more earnestlythan they had ever prayed.    The visiting pastor commented later, The Lord had invadedHis Body, and the gateway    into the supernatural world had been crossed by us all.      The following Sunday the visiting pastor wasto preach and saw the    small group gathered on the parking lot outside the church. Whenthey found him inside the    woman pulled up her sleeves and said, Look, no rashanywhere! The husband    approached and said, I&#146;ve cut back my workday toeight hours. I took the kids    to the zoo yesterday. We have a new home. (Ralph Neighbor, Where Do We Go From    Here?  p. 161-64)       In other words, it is possible to turn a smallgroup into just another  impersonal time where we learn some more about the Bible, but donot minister to each  other in an interpersonal way in the power of the Holy Spirit. Onthe other hand, it is  possible to lay hold on the supernatural supply of the Holy Spiritby faith and minister  to each other in ways that, over generations, might rebuild ahealthy church body with  less weakness and sickness and immaturity and fruitlessness thanwe see today.    So what I am pleading for this morning is aserious reconsideration of  whether you are experiencing corporate church life the way Christreveals it in the New  Testament.      Paul&#146;s Description of Church Life: TheBuilding Up Of The Body     Let me take just a few minutes to sketchwhat that looks like from  Ephesians 4. Start with verses 16,          . . . from whom the whole body, beingfitted and held together by    that which every joint supplies, according to the proper workingof each individual part,    causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself inlove.         Now this is a description of how the church,the body of Christ  causes growth and is built up in love.    Notice two things. First, the verse begins withthe words,  . . .  from whom. The growth and building up of the body isfrom somebody. Whom  does whom refer to? The answer is the last word inverse 15: . . . who  is the head,  even   Christ  . . .  fromwhom  . . . So  the first and most important thing to say about how interpersonalchurch life happens as  the church is built up is that it happens from Christ.That is, it is  supernatural. Christ lived once, died for our sins, rose again,ascended into heaven. He  reigns there today and, as he promised, he is building his church.He is not passive and  distant. He is a living, dynamic, active head of the body. He issupplier and guide by his  Spirit. But will we receive his supply? Will we expect it andchannel it to each other?  That&#146;s the first thing to see: Christ is the living source ofchurch life and growth.    The second thing to see in verse 16 is that,even though the growth and  building up of the body happens from Christ, it is thebody itself that is the  immediate active cause of that growth. Verse 16: . . . fromwhom the whole body. .  . That&#146;s the subject of the sentence; now where is theverb? What does the  whole body do? The verb is way down in the last line: thewhole body . . . causes  the growth of the body. Everything else in that verse isexplains how. But the basic  sentence is the whole body . . . causes the growth of thebody.    So even though growth and upbuilding are fromChrist, the head, it is  the whole body that builds the body. And the wordwhole is important. The  whole body builds the body. That point is emphasized in the words,according to the  working of each individual part. The whole body -- that is,each individual part in  the body properly functioning -- causes the growth of the body.    Now I ask you, where and how does that happenin your corporate church  life? Can we ever create enough programs that every person wouldbe involved using some  particular gift? That&#146;s probably not even the right questionto ask. Isn&#146;t it  more likely that Paul envisions a kind of regular gathering of thebody in groups small  enough so that every member of the body can minister to otherswith his own unique  spiritual gifts?    Look at verse 7:           To each one of us grace was givenaccording to the measure of    Christ's gift. 8 Therefore it says, When He ascended on high, heled captive a hose of    captives, and he gave gifts to men.        Notice: To EACH one of us grace wasgiven. And then in  verse 8 that grace is expressed in terms of gifts: Therefore,  it says . . .  he gave gifts to men.    So what verse 16 means when it says thatthe whole body causes  the growth of the body when each individual part isworking properly, it  means that all the members have gifts, and all of those gifts areto be used in building  up the body in love. And this is how Christ, the all-supplying, supernatural Head of  the body, builds and cares for his church.     Conclusion: Is Significant Change Needed?     So I close by asking again, Is there notimplied here an immense  resource for healing and joy and power and strength and missionthat most Christians miss  because they only experience church as worship services andclasses? Is there an organic  flaw in this pattern that may account for untold weaknesses anddiscouragements in the  Body of Christ?    I invite you to put this matter to a test. Areyou living normal New  Testament church life in personal spiritual ministry with others?Or are you part of a  flawed and disfigured pattern of life that may account for moreweakness and woe in the  church than we can imagine?
