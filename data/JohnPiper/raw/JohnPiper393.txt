       A SOJOURN ON EARTH IN CONFIDENT FEAR    (1 Peter 1:17-19)        And if you address as Father the One who      impartially judges according to each man's work, conduct      yourselves in fear during the time of your stay upon earth;      knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like      silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your      forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished      and spotless, the blood of Christ.         
       We come now this morning to the third command of the Christian   life in 1 Peter. Verses 1-12 were celebration of what God has done   to make us his own for ever and ever. Then in verse 13 came the   first command: "Fix your hope completely on the grace to be   brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." So the first   command is HOPE fully in the grace of God.       The second command came last week in verse 15: "Be holy in all   your behavior." God says, "Be holy for I am holy" (v. 16). So the   first command is be hopeful in the grace of God, and the second   command is be holy in the holiness of God.       Today we reach the third command: "Conduct yourselves in fear."   Verse 17: "And if you address as Father the One who impartially   judges according to each man's work, conduct yourselves in fear   during the time of your stay upon earth."        Three commandments:         Live in hope!       Live in holiness!       Live in fear!       With each of these commands we move farther and farther away   from the temperament of the modern world. And with each succeeding   week I know I can count on less and less natural sympathy for what   I say.       For the first commandment, "live in hope," I doubt that anyone   had their defenses up thinking, "No way is he going to convince me   that hope is a Biblical way to live."       For the second commandment, "live in holiness" the receptivity   was still pretty high because we believe that God is holy, but   we're not so sure we know what it means or what is really expected   of us. So there's a little wariness about hearing a sermon on the   necessity to be holy.       For the third commandment, "live in fear," I assume almost   universal suspicion for what I am about to say. Not that you don't   trust me. Fear of God just isn't in the acceptable air we breath   today. It's not part of the culturally correct -- which means   mainly psychologically correct -- view of the healthy, satisfying   religious life.       And not only that, but fear simply seems to be incompatible   with hope. And incompatible with faith and peace and joy. After   all, doesn't 1 John 4:18 say, "Perfect love casts out fear." Yes,   but the verse goes on, "Fear involves punishment, and the one who   fears is not perfected in love." So until we are perfected in love   we may not use that verse to say there is no place for fearing   punishment.       So for cultural and Biblical reasons I understand that there is   resistance to preaching about the fear of God.       So what I want to plead for first this morning is that you   recognize that growing deeper and stronger as a Christian comes   not by choosing to embrace only those Biblical teachings you are   already comfortable with and already easily understand -- you   don't grow that way. But rather you grow deep and strong by also   embracing the teachings you are not comfortable with and that are   hard to understand with the confidence that God has not taught us   anything false or harmful in the Scriptures.       The second thing I want to plead for is that you take verses   17-19 seriously and strive to be counter-cultural enough and   deeply Biblical enough to make them part of how you live.       We have a few minutes. Let me focus your attention on how Peter   sees fearing God in relation to judgment and redemption. The   command to fear is the second half of verse 17: "conduct   yourselves in fear during the time of your stay upon earth."   There's no special word for "reverence" or "reverent fear" in   Greek. Adding that word is an editor's interpretation of what   flavor he thinks the word should have. It may be right, or may be   too limiting.       On either side of that command to conduct ourselves in fear is   a reason for this fear. On the front side in the first half of   verse 17 is this reason: "If you address as Father the One who   impartially judges according to each man's work . . ."        Fear living as though our faith were not in   God        So the first reason for conducting ourselves in fear is that   the One we call heavenly Father judges everybody on the same kind   of evidence -- namely, what do our lives (our deeds) say about our   heart? There won't be different rules for different people. There   is one thing that saves: faith. And there is one standard of   judgment: life (deeds).       If this is true, Peter says, there is a very appropriate fear   as we live our lives, namely, a fear of living as though our faith   (our hope!) were not in God. Here's the link between verse 17 and   verse 13, between living in hope and living in fear. What we are   to fear, Peter means, is not hoping in God (cf. Rom. 11:20).       When we are tempted to conduct ourselves in a way that would   show that our hope is in money rather than God, we should fear.   When we are tempted to act in a way that would show that our hope   is in the pleasure of pornography instead of God, we should fear.   When Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6:18, "Flee fornication," he   meant, "fear what it would mean about where your hope is if you   commit fornication." It was the same spirit that Jesus had when he   said, "If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better   to enter life with one eye than with to be cast into hell" (cf.   Matt. 5:29). Fear living in ways that betray your lack of   satisfaction in God.       This is one crucial missing note in modern Christianity, and   one of the main reasons why the church is such a carbon copy of   the world. We think that grace means there's nothing to fear in   our behavior. And so the sanction of judgment has no place in our   lives. And 1 Peter 1:17 is simply blanked out in our superficial   adaptation to culture. But God is gracious and calls us back today   to fear the behavior that leads to destruction.        Fear living as though Jesus' blood is not   precious        But now notice that on the other side of verse 17 Peter gives   another reason for conducting ourselves in fear. He says,        Conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your      stay upon earth; 18 knowing that you were not redeemed (or      ransomed) with perishable things like silver or gold from your      futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, 19 but with      precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the      blood of Christ.         If I said, "Let's not be anxious about our finances, knowing   that God will meet all our needs," what I would mean is, "Don't be   anxious, because we know God will meet all our needs."       That's the same reasoning we have in these verses: "Conduct   yourselves in fear, knowing . . . -- because you know your were   ransomed not with small temporary values like gold and silver, but   with an infinite, eternal value, the blood of Jesus." Boiled down:   "Fear, because you've been ransomed at infinite cost."       Make sense? It didn't to me at first. But here's where you can   grow. You can send your roots deeper and your branches higher.   Don't just blank it out. For one thing, it sounds just like Psalm   130:4, "There is forgiveness with you (O God), that you may be   feared." Forgiveness leads to fear! In the same way Peter says,   "There's an infinite ransom paid, the blood of Jesus, to rescue   you from your old ways of life; so conduct yourselves in fear."       In fact what Peter specifically stresses in verses 18 and 19 is   the surpassing value and eternal durability of the ransom paid for   God's people. He says that gold and silver are "perishable" --   they are not durable, they don't last. And he says that the blood   of Jesus is "precious" -- it's infinitely valuable. So he stresses   that the ransom paid for us is permanent and precious.       And the point in connection with verse 17 is: in proportion to   the preciousness and the permanence of the ransom we should all   the more conduct ourselves with fear. You'd think it would be just   the other way around: The more precious and permanent the ransom   paid on our behalf, the less we need to fear.       Yes! Yes! And that is gloriously true in once sense: "Who shall   bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies! Who   is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus who died (who paid the   infinitely precious and permanent ransom!)" (Rom. 8:33-34).       But what if Peter means, "Fear conducting yourself as though   the ransom were not precious"? I think that's exactly what he   means. Because he says in verse 18 that the design of the ransom   -- the redemption -- is to rescue you from your futile way of   life. Do you see that? Verse 18: "You were not redeemed with   perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of   life. . . but by the precious blood of Christ."       The aim and purpose and design of the ransom in this verse is   not forgiveness but transformation. The aim in this verse is   victory over the power of sin in your everyday life, not   forgiveness from the guilt of sin (as true as that is). The reason   Jesus shed his infinitely precious was to change our conduct (cf.   Tit. 2:14).       So when Peter says, "Conduct yourselves in fear, knowing that   you were ransomed from bad conduct by the blood of Jesus," he   means, fear conducting yourself in way that shows that the blood   is not precious to you.       If your heart soars with assurance as you meditate on the   eternal permanence and infinite preciousness of the ransom Jesus   paid with his blood, great! God wants you to soar with assurance.   But don't ever twist that assurance into a justification for   conduct that proves you don't think the blood is infinitely   precious.       Let me put it finally in a systematic way: God's purpose in the   blood of Jesus is our justification and our sanctification. Our   pardon and our purity. They cannot be separated (Peter stresses   the purity in verse 18).       Therefore, if in our conduct we are tempted to act as though   the preciousness and the permanence of the blood of Jesus were   impotent to hold us back from sin, then we should fear. Because if   our lives bear constant witness to the powerlessness of the blood   of Jesus, then Jesus is not really our hope and joy. And we do not   belong to him. And that is a fearful prospect.       The sum of the matter is this; hope in the grace of God! And   fear not hoping in the grace of God! Fear the behavior that would   show you don't trust in the all-satisfying preciousness of the   love of Jesus.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
