  July 6, 1986Bethlehem Baptist ChurchMorningJohn Piper, PastorCopyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper    THE FRUIT OF HOPE: JOY  Romans 12:11-12 Never flag in zeal, be aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice inhope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Today we begin to answer the last question in our series of messages on Christianhope. Until now we have asked four questions:  1) What is the definition of Christian hope? Answer: a confident expectation of good things to come (Hebrews 6:11).  2) What is the ground of Christian hope? Answer: a) the sovereign grace of God (2 Thessalonians 2:16) and b) the good news that Christ died for sinners (Colossians 1:23).  3) What is the cause of Christian hope in the human heart? What brings itabout and sustains it? Answer: a) the work of God in regeneration (1 Peter 1:3) and b) the promises of God in his word (Romans 15:4).  4) What is the content of Christian hope? What are we hoping for? Answer: a) the appearing of Jesus Christ (Titus 2:13), b) the redemption of our bodies (Romans 8:23), c) the consummation of our righteousness (Galatians 5:5), d) sharing the glory of God (Romans 5:2) and e) inheriting eternal life (Titus 1:2; 3:7).  Now we will pose one more question and, Lord willing, spend the four Sundaysof July answering it. The question is: What is the fruit of our Christianhope? What comes from hope? Does hope produce anything in daily life? Let's use a picture to try to see what we have been doing over these weeks.Picture hope as a tree. The ground from which hope can grow is the grace of God and the gospel ofChrist. The sprouting of the tree, the beginning of hope, happens in regeneration,or new birth. The nutriment that sustains this new hope and makes it grow strong is theword of God, especially the promises. The strong fibers of the wooden trunk are the confident expectation thatsomeday we will meet Christ face to face, we will have new bodies that neverget sick again, we will be totally free from the struggle with sin, we willshare in the glory of God, and we will never be threatened with loss becausethe new life will last for ever and ever. This simply leaves us now with the question: Does this tree bear fruit? Theanswer of the New Testament is a resounding Yes! And we are going to lookat four of these fruits of hope. Hope bears the fruit of joy. Hope bearsthe fruit of love. Hope bears the fruit of boldness. And hope bears the fruitof endurance. Or to say it another way, without Christian hope my life and your life cannotyield Christian joy or love or boldness or endurance. There are kinds ofjoy and love and courage and endurance that people have who don't hope inGod, but these are not the Christian graces that glorify God and give evidenceof his saving work in the soul. Joy and love and boldness and endurance thatdo not grow on the tree of hope in the ground of grace and truth are of nospiritual or eternal value. Today we focus on the first fruit of hope. Our text is the first phrase inRomans 12:12 -- "Rejoice in hope!" We could paraphrase it like this: "Letyour joy be the joy that comes from hope!" Or: "Bear the fruit of joy inthe branch of hope!" Or: "Be glad because you have hope!" The text establishesa firm relationship between joy and hope! To unpack this text let's ask three questions: 1. What is Christian joy? (We have already answered, What is hope?) 2. Can this joy be commanded? 3. How can we obey the command? How do joy and hope relate to each otherin practical experience?  1. What is Christian joy? It is very difficult to put emotional experiences into words. But let metry to at least point in the right direction with three contrasts -- threethings that joy is not and three things that joy is. First, Christian joy is not an act of will-power, but a spontaneous, emotionalresponse of the heart. Christian joy has this in common with all joy, whetherChristian or not. When Peter speaks in 1 Peter 1:9 of rejoicing with "unutterable and exaltedjoy," in anticipation of our final salvation, he is not describing a decision;he is describing an explosion. You can decide to brush your teeth, or getan allergy shot; but you cannot, in the same way, decide to rejoice. Youcan decide to do things that may bring you joy -- drive to the country, visita friend, read a Psalm -- but whether joy actually happens is not in yourown power, the way many other acts are. It may or it may not be there. That is what I mean when I call it spontaneous. You can prepare for it --like lifting your sail on a still ocean. But you cannot not make the windblow. The Spirit blows where it wills, and joy is a fruit of the Spirit(Galatians 5:22). That is the first contrast: Christian joy is not an act of will-power. Itis a spontaneous, emotional response of the heart. Second, Christian joy is not superficial and flimsy, but deep and firm. This is why people like to distinguish it from happiness and pleasure. Happinessand pleasure seem too superficial and flimsy. Of course we must be very carefulhere. There is a superficial happiness and a superficial pleasure. But theBible also speaks of "pleasures for evermore in God's right hand" (Psalm16:11); and it says, "Happy the people whose God is the Lord!" (Psalm 144:15).So the words happiness and pleasure don't have to be superficial. They canmean the very same thing joy does. But it is true to say that Christian joy is deep and firm rather than superficialand flimsy. The reason we know this is that the Bible describes Christianjoy as flourishing right in the midst of pain and suffering. Romans 5:3,"We rejoice in our sufferings." 1 Thessalonians 1:6, "You received the wordin much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit." 2 Corinthians 8:2,"In a sever test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extremepoverty have over flowed in a wealth of liberality." This is clearly a very peculiar emotion that not only endures but seems toeven flourish in affliction. It is even more startling to read that Paul'sjoy could exist not merely alongside suffering but even in the midst of sorrow,which seems to be its opposite. In 2 Corinthians 6:10 he describes himself"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as havingnothing, and yet possessing everything." This is what I am trying to get at when I say that Christian joy is notsuperficial and flimsy but deep and firm. I think I tasted a little bit ofPaul's meaning in my own experience, for example, when my mother was killedin 1974. I wept more than I ever had, but it was not as those who have nohope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Deep beneath the turbulence on the surface ofmy life there was a strong current of confidence and joy that all was wellin the hands of a sovereign God. That is the second contrast to help us understand Christian joy. First, itis not an act of will-power, but a spontaneous, emotional response of theheart. Second, it is not superficial and flimsy, but deep and firm. Third, Christian joy is not natural but spiritual. This distinguishes Christian joy from all other joys. When something is calledspiritual in scripture it means that it comes from the Holy Spirit and hasthe character of the Holy Spirit. Don't ever make the mistake of thinkingthat something is "spiritual" simply because it has to do with the spirit,and that something is natural simply because it has to do with the body orwith material things. Pride is natural, but resides in the spirit of man. Envy is natural, butresides in the spirit of man. And so it is with jealousy and anger and strifeand self-pity and resentment and bitterness and covetousness and hatred andselfishness. These all come from the inner spirit of a person, but they arenot called spiritual in the Bible. They are called natural, because no special,supernatural influences of the Holy Spirit are needed to produce them. Weproduce these things by our own nature. So they are called natural. What makes something spiritual is that it is produced under the specialinfluences of the Spirit of God, and has the character of the Spirit of God.So when we say Christian joy is spiritual, not natural, we mean that it isproduced by the Spirit of God and is the kind of joy that God has. Galatians 5:22 says, "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace..." 1Thessalonians 1:6 says that the Christians "received the word in much afflictionand with the joy of the Holy Spirit." Romans 14:17 says that "the Kingdomof God . . . is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." AndJesus on several occasions said that he wanted to have his joy fulfilledin his disciples (John 15:11; 17:13). So there is plenty of Biblical evidence that Christian joy is not the mereproduct of the human spirit in response to pleasant circumstances. It isthe product, or fruit, of God's Spirit. And it is not just a human joy; itis the very joy of Christ fulfilled in us. One of the practical reasons that this is important to know is that it warnsus against a false joy. There is a natural joy even in spiritual things whichmany mistake for a spiritual joy. For example, from the parable of the foursoils Jesus gave this interpretation of the seed sown on rocky ground: As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is he who hears the word andimmediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself, but enduresfor a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of theword, immediately he falls away. (Matthew 13:20) Here is a joy in the word of God that is not a spiritual joy and is no evidencethat a true conversion has taken place. It is not the work of the indwellingSpirit of God. It does not have the character of Christ's joy. It vanisheslike the dew when the hot sun of affliction rises in the sky. Why does this joy vanish so easily? Why is it superficial and flimsy? Evidentlybecause it was not a joy in God but merely in some of the comforts that Godmight give. When the afflictions and the persecutions and the hard timescome, and the comforts disappear, so does the joy. Because it was not thefruit of the Spirit; it was not the joy of Christ, that delights in God nomatter what the external circumstances are. In response to our first question then, What is Christian joy? -- First, it is not an act of will-power, but a spontaneous, emotional responseof the heart. Second, it is not superficial and flimsy, but deep and firm.Third, it is not natural, but spiritual. Now in view of all this we turnto our second question:  2. Can this joy be commanded? Can God command us to rejoice if joy is not an act of will-power but aspontaneous emotional response of the heart and is not a product of naturalresources but a fruit of the Holy Spirit? The answer that lies on the faceof scripture at many places is: Yes, he can, and he does. Matthew 5:12, "Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven."1 Thessalonians 5:16, "Rejoice always!" Philippians 4:4, "Rejoice in theLord always; again I say rejoice!" 1 Peter 4:13, "Rejoice in so far as youshare Christ's sufferings." And even though the word for rejoice here inRomans 12:12 is literally a participle ("rejoicing in hope" NASB, KJV) themeaning is clearly imperative: "rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation,devoted to prayer" -- these are clearly things we are obliged to do. Thisis even more clear in verse 15, where all the versions translate it as acommand: "Rejoice with those who rejoice!" So the answer is, Yes, God can and does command his people to rejoice. Eventhough joy is not controlled by our will-power, and even though it is a fruitof God's Spirit and beyond our natural resources, nevertheless we are commandedto have this experience! Why? Because we ought to have it -- God is infinitely worthy of our delight.And because the only thing standing between the command of God to rejoiceand our experience of that joy is a sinful heart -- a heart that delightsmore in the things of the world than in God. And if we try to excuse ourdisobedience by saying, "I can't rejoice in God; I have a sinful heart,"our words will not excuse us; they will condemn us. In short, it is right for God to command his creatures to have a spontaneous,deep, spiritual delight in him the same way it is right for God to demandthat we be born again (John 3:3) and that we get a new heart (Ezekiel 18:31).Righteousness does not cease to be a duty just because we are wicked. And so we come to our last question:  3. How can we obey this command? And since the text says, "Rejoice in hope," we ask, How does hope figureinto our obedience to this command? And since we have seen that Christianjoy is a fruit of the Spirit, we must also ask, How do the Holy Spirit andhope relate to each other in producing joy? There are two places in Romans where joy and hope and the Holy Spirit areall brought together so we can see how they relate to each other (5:2-5 and15:13). We will only have time to look at one of them. So let's consider Romans 5:2-5. Through him (Christ) we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand,and we rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God. 3) More than that,we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,4) and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 5) andhope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into ourhearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us. In verse 2 Paul says that he does the very thing that he commands in Romans12:12: he rejoices in hope, specifically, hope in the glory of God. Then in verse 3 he says that he rejoices in his sufferings as well. But why?The answer is that it's just another way of rejoicing in hope. Follow histrain of thought: the reason we rejoice in suffering is that suffering producesendurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope! Sowhat he is really rejoicing in when he rejoices in suffering is more hope.Hope is the great source of joy in Paul's life. Matthew Henry put it like this: The joy and peace of believers arise chiefly from their hopes. What is laidout upon them is but little, compared with what is laid up for them; thereforethe more hope they have the more joy and peace they have. . . . Christiansshould desire and labor after an abundance of hope. (Commentary on Romans15:13) But how does this hope and joy in Romans 5:2-4 relate to the work of theHoly Spirit? This is what Paul tells us in verse 5: "And hope does not disappointus, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spiritwhich has been given to us." Verse 5 says that underneath our hope, giving it an unshakable foundation,is the love of God. And the work of the Holy Spirit is to pour this loveinto our hearts, to make us see it and grasp it and cherish it. Now we can put the pieces together: first, there is the love of God whichchooses us and calls us and justifies us and guarantees for us a share inthe glory of God. Then there is the work of the Holy Spirit that pours thelove of God into our hearts so that we recognize it and cherish it. Thenout of this deep experience of the love of God grows an unshakable hope evenin the midst of suffering. And finally in this hope we rejoice. How then do we obey the commandment to rejoice? How do we fight for joy inthe ups and downs of everyday life? First, let us acknowledge that by nature we are sinners and helpless to becomethe kind of people who rejoice in the glory of God rather than our own glory. Second, let us cry out to the God of hope that he would send his Holy Spiritand pour the love of God into our hearts. Third, let us set our minds on the Biblical expressions and evidences ofGod's love for repentant sinners. For example: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress,or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written,         "For thy sake we are being killed       all the day long;       we are regarded as sheep       to be slaughtered."   No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who lovedus. For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth,nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the loveof God in Christ Jesus our Lord. And so, finally, when the love of God has filled us with hope in the gloryof God, we rejoice in that hope, and again I say to you REJOICE!   Copyright 1996,1999 John Piper    Piper's Notes
