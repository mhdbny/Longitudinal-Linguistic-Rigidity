       "You Joyfully Accepted the Plundering Of Your Property"    (Hebrews 10:32-36)        But remember the former days, when, after being      enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,      partly, by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and      tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who      were so treated. For you showed sympathy to the prisoners, and      accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that      you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.      Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great      reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have      done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.         
       The Christian Church in America suffers from about 350 years of   dominance and prosperity. What I mean by dominance is that in most   of American history being Christian has been viewed as normal and   good and patriotic and culturally acceptable and even beneficial.   What I mean by prosperity is that being Christian has generally   resulted in things going well for us American Christians. Since   the Christian ethos has been dominant it has also been a pathway   to success. And what I mean by suffering--that we are suffering   from 350 years of dominance and prosperity--is that this has   deeply ingrained in us a massively unbiblical mindset, namely, a   mindset of at-homeness in this world and in this age.       We have been dominant and we have been prosperous, and   therefore we have come to feel at home in this world, and have   developed a deeply ingrained assumption that things should go well   for us, and that this is our world and our age, that being a good   Christian and being well thought of must go together, and that   poverty and sickness and suffering and death is the worst thing   that can happen in a land of Christian wealth and health and ease   and upbeat success-oriented vitality.       And so we have developed a form of Christianity to support this   ingrained expectation of acceptance and comfort and prosperity.   This Christianity begins by focussing on our felt needs (not our   eternal ones that we may not even be aware of), and it makes its   appeal on the basis that Christianity will make life a lot better   for us in this world. It is not a call to suffer as an alien, but   a call to prosper as a respected citizen--and to be very indignant   and angry if we don't.       There is enough truth in this to make it plausible. If you act   like a Christian you won't have illicit sex and so you probably   won't get AIDS--that's better. If you act like a Christian you   won't drink to excess and so you will be spared the devastation of   alcoholism--that's better. If you act like a Christian you will   work hard and be thrifty and will probably do better in   business--that's better. If you act like a Christian you will be   kind and generous and so at least a few people will think well of   you--and that's better.       But we have gotten these things out of proportion--we have   elevated the relatively minor this-worldly spin-offs of faith so   highly and made them so dominant in our thinking and expectations   that the New Testament pattern of Christianity seems almost   incredible to us and we can hardly grasp what it was like to be   Christian in the beginning, and what God may be calling us to   today.       This text fills me with a longing to be free from domesticated,   comfort-seeking, entertainment-addicted Christianity. I hope it   does the same for you.       The writer tells the church to "remember the former days, when,   after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of   sufferings." The word "enlightened" is used at least two ways in   the New Testament: it can mean that the one enlightened sees more   clearly or shines more clearly. For example, it can mean that   light "goes on" in the heart and truth is seen clearly that once   was dark (as when Paul prayed that the Ephesians would have the   eyes of their hearts enlightened to know God--1:18). Or it can   mean that what is enlightened (doesn't see more clearly but)   shines more clearly (as when Paul says that Christ lightened life   and immortality, that is, Christ brought them to light; he made   them shine more clearly--1 Tim. 1:10).       What does it mean here in Hebrews 10:32? It's pretty clearly a   reference to their conversion. And both meanings seem to be very   relevant from what we know about that conversion. On the one hand   to become a Christian means (from 2 Cor. 4:6) that God says, "Let   there be light" in our hearts and "the light of the knowledge of   the glory of God in the face of Christ" fills us with confidence   of his reality and worth. So we are "enlightened" in the first   sense--we see the glory of God and the reality of Christ more   clearly. Lights go on in us.       But then the New Testament talks about how becoming a Christian   means we also shine like lights in the midst of a crooked and   perverse world (Phil. 2:15). We don't just see the light of God's   glory more clearly, we begin to reflect it. God shines into us and   we shine out to the world.       So I take Hebrews 10:32 to point to these two things. These   Christians had come to see the light of the gospel of the glory of   God as true and infinitely valuable; AND they had then begun to   shine in the world as a witness to this truth and value. The first   experience set them free from the world and the second made them   stand out from the world.       And the result was suffering. Verse 32: "But remember the   former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great   conflict of sufferings." It is not unnatural for the world to see   the shining of Christian truth and Christian love and hate it.   Just before Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men that   they may see your good deeds and give glory to your Father in   heaven," (which sounds like a positive response) he also said,   "Blessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you and utter   all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account" (Matt.   5:16,11). In other words, some are enlightened by your shining;   others are incensed by your shining.       In the former days, after the Hebrew Christians started to see   the glory of Christ and to shine with the glory of Christ, they   also started to suffer for Christ. That's what Christianity meant.   Receive Christ and receive suffering. Evidently they thought   things or said things or did things that were not politically   correct in those days and the upshot was that some of them got   arrested and some others got in trouble because they stood by   those who got arrested.       Verses 33-34 explain the way they suffered: "partly, by being   made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and   partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated. For you   showed sympathy to the prisoners."       So there were two ways that these early Christians suffered:   one was that some of them got arrested and put in prison, and the   other was that the other Christians were willing to share their   suffering by showing public sympathy.       This sympathy cost them a lot. Their property was seized. Verse   34: "You showed sympathy to the prisoners, and accepted joyfully   the seizure of your property." The scene evidently is that some   were put in prison. Others had to decide whether to show their   solidarity with them or not. They remembered the teachings of   Jesus, perhaps, and went to the prison. Jesus said, "I was in   prison and you came to me . . . inasmuch as you did it unto one of   the least of these my brothers, you did it to me" (Mat. 25:36,40).   Hebrew 13:3 says, "Remember those in prison as though in prison   with them."       When they did this the officials or the mob plundered their   property. Perhaps they burned their homes or broke out their   windows and stole their furniture. Or it might refer to official   fines. Whatever it was, showing sympathy with their suffering   brothers and sisters, cost them their possessions.       On February 21 of this year in Egypt three Americans, one New   Zealander and one Egyptian were arrested for forming a "Christian   missionary organization." The wives of Brian Eckheart and Thomas   Martin obviously sympathized with their husbands. They spoke with   them by phone in the Tura Prison in Cairo every twelve hours. The   result of this sympathetic relationship was that the wives and   children were evicted from their homes on two days notice. (The   Standard, May, 1993, p. 27).       In other words, then and now it takes a good deal of courage to   let your light shine before a world that may not want to see it.   Or another way to put it is that it takes a good deal of   detachment from the possessions you have accumulated in this   world. It appears that the ground for courage in radical obedience   to Jesus is freedom from the love of things, or even from the   simple dependence on things.       I think I can say with the full authority of this text and the   rest of the New Testament that whatever measure of material and   physical loss God may call you to in this world, one thing is   certain: being a Christian means being willing and ready to let it   all go for the sake of Christ and his word.       Where does that freedom come from? The text is very clear in   answer to that. And the answer is not that it comes from some   superior kind of grace given to saints and martyrs. The answer is   that it comes from cherishing the reward of heaven more than life   on earth. This is the other aspect of being "enlightened" (v. 32).   Their eyes were opened to see the glory and worth of their future   reward. Verse 34b: "You accepted joyfully the seizure of your   property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession   and an abiding one. Therefore, do not throw away your confidence,   which has a great reward."       Right here is one of the main keys to why the church in America   is so anemic. We are at home in this world. But these early   Christians were aliens and exiles whose true home was in heaven   and in the age to come with Jesus. That world was so real to them   and so precious that they did the unthinkable: they "JOYFULLY   accepted the seizure of their property." It's the joy that's so   jolting here. It's the joy. This gives fresh meaning to the Old   Testament word: "The joy of the Lord is your strength" (Nehemiah   8:10).       There's only one explanation for this joy: they really believed   it! They were "enlightened" by God to see it! They believed two   things about their possession in heaven: one is that it is better   ("you yourselves have a better possession" - v. 34) and the other   is that this possession is abiding. In other words they really   believed that this world is inferior and this world is temporary.   The one to come is superior and the one to come is eternal.       These were not words, they were realities. They were so real   that when the house and the furniture and the clothes and the   books burned, and the horses were stolen they knew (the word in v.   34 is "knowing"!) that God was actually preparing them for an   eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison. They said with Paul   in 2 Cor. 6:10--we "have nothing yet we possess everything."       The key to their joy in the midst of danger and loss was that   they simply did not put much stock in this world. They had been   transferred into the kingdom of God's Son (Col. 1:13). They had   passed from death to life. Their lives were hid with Christ in   God.       The two things that everybody wants they had found--but not in   this world. Everybody wants the best happiness possible and the   longest happiness possible. This is what the words "better and   abiding" point to. They had a better possession and an abiding   one. And the possession they had was a place at God's side in   glory. "In your presence is fullness of joy and at your right hand   are pleasures for ever more." Full and for ever. Better and   abiding.       If we are going to be courageous and fearless before our   opponents, if we are going to live so that the worth of the gospel   is manifest, if we are going to take the risks the early   Christians took for Christ and his kingdom, if we are going to be   as bold as a lion, then we are going to have to set our minds on   things that are above not on things that are on the earth. We are   going to have to focus as much attention on the worth of heaven   and the life to come as the world tries to make us focus on the   worth of this very brief life.       That is what God is calling us to in these days. May there be   true gospel "enlightenment" among us. And may we know that we have   a better possession and an abiding one.
