  March 16, 1986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning Pastor John Piper Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   BLESSED ARE THE PERSECUTED  MATTHEW 5:10-12   Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs  is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute  you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice  and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so men persecuted the  prophets who were before you.     The first question I would like to take up this morning is whether Jesus'  words about persecution are relevant in these days. Has modern society become  so tolerant that talk of persecution is outdated? My answer is that these  verses are very relevant and not at all outdated. Let me mention two reasons  why this teaching on persecution is still relevant today.     1. The first reason comes from a global perspective. Let's just take two  countries as examples. Peru's National Evangelical Council has documented  the killings of 90 evangelical Christians from 1983 through 1985. 70% were  pentecostals, and 20% were Presbyterians, the rest undetermined. The Maoist  Sendero Luminoso oppose the evangelicals because they refuse to join the  armed struggle of the guerrillas. And the government police oppose them because  they treat the wounds of guerillas. Besides the 90 killed in the last three  years, another 20 have disappeared after being detained by police for  questioning.     The other country I will mention is Romania. I just received a letter a couple  weeks ago from John Swanson, the pastor of Elim Baptist in Anoka, in which  he told me of a businessman who just returned from Romania with tragic stories  of the persecution of Baptists in that land. The man will be speaking in  their evening service on April 6 with a first-hand report.     According to the World Christian Encyclopedia, 2.2 billion people lived in  79 countries under significant restrictions on their religious freedom in  1980. 60% of all Christians live in these countries. And 16% (224 million)  of all Christians live in countries where there is severe state interference  and harassment.     So the least we can say is that from a global standpoint the words of Jesus  are very relevant, and indeed very precious, for millions of our brothers  and sisters who live under the pressure of constant surveillance.     2. My second reason for saying that these words about persecution are relevant  today is taken from the words of Paul in 2 Timothy 3:12, "Indeed, all who  desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted." (See Acts  14:22; John 15:20; Matthew 10:25.)     How could Paul make such a sweeping statement? "All who desire to live a  godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted." He makes it on the basis  of a deep conviction about the nature of Christianity and the nature of the  sinfulness of man. He is convinced that there is such a tension between the  message and way of life of Christians on the one hand and the mindset and  way of life of the world on the other that conflict is inevitable.     This conviction is rooted in the nature of fallen man and the nature of the  new creation in Christ. Therefore it does not go out of date. It is still  true today. Sooner or later a deeply God-centered Christian will be mistreated  for the things he believes or the life he lives.     So these words of Jesus about persecution are relevant for today not only  because millions of Christians in our global village are being persecuted  for their faith this very day, but also because to one degree or another  all of you who are in dead earnest about putting God first in your work and  home and school and leisure will bump into some form of opposition sooner  or later. And none of us knows when our freedoms may cease or when we may  be called by God to go to a dangerous place or take a stand here that will  cause many to dislike us.     Now what is this teaching of Jesus?     First, let's focus on why the persecutions come. This is important because  not all persecuted people are blessed. Only those who are persecuted for  righteousness' sake. Verse 10: "Blessed are those who are persecuted for  righteousness' sake."     Recall the structure of the beatitudes. There are two groups of four, and  each group ends with a reference to righteousness. The first group ends with  verse 6: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness." And  the second group ends with verse 10: "Blessed are those who are persecuted  for righteousness' sake."     The three beatitudes that lead to hunger for righteousness are descriptions  of a kind of holy emptiness. Blessed are the poor in spirit, those who mourn  over their needy condition and the meek who hand their cause over to God.  It's natural that these three descriptions of emptiness and need should be  followed by a description of hunger. If you don't have something you hunger  for it.     Then the next three beatitudes are descriptions not of emptiness but of fullness.  The hunger is beginning to be satisfied by an overflowing mercy, a pure heart  and a power to make peace. So the righteousness longed for in verse 6 is  given in the form of mercy, purity, and peacemaking. The result is persecution  for this very righteousness.     Another way to define the righteousness of verse 10 is to look at its parallel  in verse 11. In verse 10 the persecution is "on account of righteousness",  but in verse 11 it is "on account of Jesus". "Blessed are you when men revile  you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on  my account." "On my account" and "on account of righteousness" probably mean  the same thing.     So what we learn from this is that true righteousness -- the righteousness  that surpasses the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees (5:20) -- always  involves a relationship with Jesus. True righteousness is not done for its  own sake. It is done for Jesus' sake. The mercy and the purity and the  peacemaking of a disciple of Jesus comes from Jesus ("without me you can  do nothing," John 15:5) and is done for the honor of Jesus. It's this attachment  to Jesus that gives our righteousness its distinct character.     But that raises a question: if that is what righteousness means -- being  merciful and pure and peaceable by relying on Jesus and living for his glory  -- why would anybody persecute that? It doesn't seem very offensive.     The answer that goes to the root cause is found in Luke 16:14-15. Jesus has  just said, "No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the  one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the  other. You cannot serve God and money." Then comes the persecution, the mockery.  Verse 14 says, "The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this,  and they scoffed at him." There is the persecution and part of its explanation:  "they were loves of money." In other words, Jesus' attitude toward money  is an attack on their love of money.     Then comes the rest of the explanation of their mockery. Verse 15: "But he  said to them, 'You are those who justify yourselves before men.'" So here  is the root of persecution with its two shafts. One shaft is the love of  something evil or untrue and the other shaft is the need to justify that  love. This is the root cause of persecution.     Jesus comes on the scene with a way of life and a message that implies that  the love of money is treason against God. "You can't serve two sovereigns!"  This is not an antagonistic insult. It is part of his purity. It is true.  It is essential to know if you are going to be saved. But it goes against  the Pharisee's love of money. So to justify themselves they put Jesus down.  This is standard operating procedure for self-justification. And this the  root of all persecution.     So we can see why a life devoted to righteousness or godliness will be persecuted  or reviled or spoken against.     -- If you cherish chastity, your life will be an attack on people's love  for free sex.     -- If you embrace temperance, your life will be a statement against the love  of alcohol.     -- If you pursue self-control, your life will indict excess eating.     -- If you live simply and happily, you will show the folly of luxury.     -- If you walk humbly with your God, you will expose the evil of pride.     --If you are punctual and thorough in your dealings, you will lay open the  inferiority of laziness and negligence.     -- If you speak with compassion, you will throw callousness into sharp relief.     -- If you are earnest, you will make the flippant look flippant instead of  clever.     -- And if you are spiritually minded you will expose the worldlimindedness  of those around you.     When you desire to be godly in all your affairs and relationships -- when  you follow the righteousness of Jesus in his strength and for his glory --  there are two possible responses people can have who stay around you. These  are described in John 3:20-21.     For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light,  lest his deeds should be exposed. [That is one possible response: hating  the light and not accepting it.] But he who does what is true comes to the  light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.  [That is the other possible response: doing the truth and coming to it and  freely admitting that all good in us is accomplished by God.]     The two options are persecution or conversion. (See these two options in  Matthew 5:10 and 16.) But, we ask, what about all the unbelievers in my life  who are neither converted nor persecuting -- who are just civil, or even  polite? There are at least two possible explanations.     One is that your light is under a bushel. You are keeping the stumbling block  of the cross well concealed (Galatians 5:11; 6:12-13). You don't let your  distinctive values show.     The other is that you are letting them show and the people around you are  moving toward one or the other of these two polls: persecution or conversion.  Neither of these must happen immediately. There are all kinds of factors  that can hinder expressions of persecution. We see these often in the gospels  when the Pharisees were angered but were hindered by expediency from from  expressing their anger in outright persecution. Neither persecution nor  conversion will always happen immediately. In fact many people are torn inside  themselves, partly hating the claims of Christianity in your life, partly  attracted by them.     So we should all examine ourselves to see if we are playing a kind of cowardly  Christian incognito. And if so we should repent and resolve to be more sincere  in the expression of who we really are. But we must not assume that, because  there is no persecution right now and no conversion right now, the fault  must lie with us. The gestation period for the new birth may be nearing a  happy end. Or the storm may be ready to break against you.     But in either case you can be very content. Which leads us to our other  consideration this morning: the blessedness of the persecuted.     Verse 11: "Blessed -- fortunate -- are you when men revile you and persecute  you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice  and be glad..."     Now this is a shocking piece of counsel. What can possibly justify the command  to be glad when we are hated, and mocked and tortured and killed. And make  no mistake about it -- Jesus does have death in view here. This is what they  did to the prophets (Matthew 23:30; 1 Kings 18:13; 19:10; Nehemiah 9:26;  Jeremiah 26:23). This is what they would do to the disciples. So he says  in Matthew 24:9, "Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and put you  to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake."     What can justify such counsel to people in pain? -- "Rejoice and be glad!?"  I see two possibilities: either this is the talk of an insensitive, sophomoric,  ivory tower theologian who has never known what it is to scream with pain,  or this is the talk of one who has seen something and tasted something and  knows something about a reality that most people have never tasted or glimpsed.     This is the Lord speaking. It is not some pastoral novice that blunders into  a funeral home slapping people on the back, saying, "Praise God, anyhow."  This is the Lord. And he says to his disciples, most of whom will drink the  cup of martyrdom, "Rejoice and be glad" when you are persecuted, when you  suffer. How can he say this?     He can say it because he knows beyond any shadow of a doubt that the reward  of heaven will more than compensate for any suffering we must endure in the  service of Christ. "Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven."  There is a mystery here -- the mystery of joy in the midst of agony; the  mystery of gladness in the midst of misery and groaning. And this mystery  is contained in a miracle, namely, the miracle of faith -- the bedrock assurance  that heaven is a hundredfold compensation for every pain. To the degree that  you believe what Jesus sees in heaven, to that degree you will be able to  rejoice and be glad in suffering. "Rejoice and be glad, for great is your  reward in heaven."     But this raises a question: In order to rejoice and be glad in the suffering  of persecution must you not believe that the suffering itself enlarges your  reward in heaven? If the same reward in heaven could be obtained without  suffering, would we not cry out against the uselessness of suffering rather  than being glad to embrace it?     If nothing more comes of suffering than of not suffering why embrace it with  joy? What gave Rowland Taylor and Bishop Ridley and John Bradford the impulse  to kiss the stakes at which they were burned? What moved Obadiah Holmes,  after ninety lashes turned his back to jelly for Jesus, to say to to the  magistrates, "You have struck me with roses"? Why did Thomas Hardcastle say  that persecution is "a precious season of grace"?     I think the answer is that the more your faith is tested through suffering  the greater will be your reward. I think this is taught in Matthew 19:29  ("And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother  or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and  inherit eternal life"), but especially in 2 Corinthians 4:17-18,     For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight  of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are  seen but to the things that are unseen.     He says that affliction "prepares" or "brings about" an eternal weight of  glory. As Charles Hodge says,     Afflictions are the cause of eternal glory. Not the meritorious cause, but  still the procuring cause. God has seen fit to reveal his purpose not only  to reward with exceeding joy the afflictions of his people, but to make those  afflictions the means of working out that joy. (Commentary on Second Corinthians,  p. 104)     In other words, Rejoice and be glad in the midst of suffering for righteousness  and for Jesus, because that very suffering will receive a very great compensation  and a very great reward. And the greater the suffering your faith endures,  the greater the reward you will receive in heaven. So rejoice and be glad,  for great is your reward in heaven!     I close by pressing home one of the clear implications of this text. Jesus  wills for his disciples to desire the reward of heaven more than we desire  the reward of the world. Jesus wills for us to have our treasure in heaven  not on earth (6:19-20). Jesus wills for your heart to be so set on heaven  that to leave this earth is a cause of rejoicing. Not without tears! -- as  Paul said, "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing," and as Jesus sweat blood  in Gesthemane in the face of his own pain, but for the joy set before him  endured the cross.     Jesus wills for us to have our hearts primarily in heaven, our hopes primarily  in heaven, our longings primarily in heaven, our joy primarily in heaven.  There is no other way that you can rejoice and be glad at the loss of your  earthly joys. How shall we rejoice and be glad when these things are taken  from us if we have not loved heaven more?     So what shall we do? How shall we keep our hearts in heaven? Make a regular  practice of your life to consider the prophets of old who were persecuted  and killed for the cause of God and righteousness. Turn often to Hebrews  11:36-38 and read how by faith they suffered mocking and scourging, and even  chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were  killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute,  afflicted, ill-treated -- of whom the world was not worthy!     Go often to these great men and women of old and get inside their hearts.  Put yourself on the rack with them and learn how to love heaven with them.  Listen as they say, "Abuse suffered for the Christ is greater wealth than  all the treasures of Egypt, for we look to the reward" (Hebrews 11:26).     Read the testimonies of those who have given their all for Christ.     The letter of John Hooper written three weeks before he was burned at the  stake in England in 1555: "You must now turn all your [thoughts] from the  peril you see, and mark the felicity that followeth the peril...Beware of  beholding too much the felicity or misery of this world; for the consideration  and too earnest love or fear of either of them draweth from God." (Ryle,  Light from Old Times, p. 115)     You children, consider the children of John Rogers. He was burned alive the  same year Hooper was, because of his faith in Christ. His children accompanied  him to the place of execution and called out encouragements to him through  their tears that he might be strong and not turn back and dishonor Christ.  (Ryle, p. 64)     Consider the famous Bonhoeffer. As he left his prison room on the way to  the gallows in 1945, he said to Payne Best, "This is the end -- for me the  beginning of life." (Bethge, p. 830) Ten years later the camp doctor wrote,     At the place of execution, he again said a short prayer and then climbed  the steps to the gallows, brave and composed. His death ensued after a few  seconds. In the almost fifty years that I worked as a doctor, I have hardly  ever seen a man die so entirely submissive to the will of God. (Bethge, p.  830-31)     Or consider the last letter of Vanya Moiseyev, the 20 year old Baptist soldier  in the Soviet Red army. He had been tortured for some time. July 16, 1972  they wemt too far, and he died. On July 15 he wrote to his brother Vladimir,     Don't tell our parents everything. Just tell them, "Vanya wrote me a letter  and writes that Jesus Christ is going into battle. This is a Christian battle,  and he doesn't know whether he will be back."     I desire that all of you, dear friend, young and old, remember this one verse.  Revelation 2:10 -- "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown  of life." (M. Grant, Vanya, pp. 175f.)     Look to the prophets! Look to the martys! Whatever you must do to get your  heart in heaven and off the world, do it! Otherwise you will not be able  to obey the command of our Lord, "Rejoice and be glad in persecution, for  great is your reward in heaven."     And let the battle cry of the missions movement of our church continue to  be;     "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose."

Jim Elliot, martyr        Addendum     If someone should ask whether having our heart in heaven will make us useless  on earth, the answer is given by Jesus in the very next paragraph of the  Sermon on the Mount. People who have their hearts so much in heaven that  they fear no man but rejoice in persecution -- such radically free and joyful  people are the "salt of the earth" and "the light of the world"!!!!
