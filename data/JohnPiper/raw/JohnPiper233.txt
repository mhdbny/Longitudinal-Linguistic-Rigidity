 April 9, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor            FAITHFULNESS IS BETTER THAN LIFE    (Acts 20:22-25)        And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not   knowing what shall befall me there; except that the Holy Spirit   testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions   await me. But I do not account my life of any value nor as   precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the   ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the   gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I know that all you   among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no   more.           You recall what the situation is: Paul had spent three years in   Ephesus teaching and building up the church and evangelizing so   successfully that all the surrounding province of Asia heard the   word of the Lord (Acts 19:10). He left and spent the winter in   Corinth and is now on his way to Jerusalem, hurrying to get back   by Pentecost probably in the year A.D. 56. His boat puts in at   Miletus some 20 miles south of Ephesus and he sends for the elders   of the church (20:17). And in 20:18-35 he gives them his last   words and tells them he will never see them again.        So what we have here is a kind of last will and testament of   the great apostle to a church where he seems to have worked longer   than anywhere else. This is what he wants the elders to hear most   of all. He chose not to talk to the whole church. There wasn't   time (20:16). But he could not pass by without talking to the   elders. This shows the tremendous importance Paul put on the   eldership in the church. And the fact that Luke pauses in his   account to give us the message shows that under the inspiration of   God this message is important for us to hear as well. As the   elders go so goes the church.        So I repeat what I said last week: if you are an elder at   Bethlehem, or aspire to be one some day, listen with all your   heart and build these things into your lives. If you are not, do   two things: learn these things that you may pray them into your   elders; and take them for yourself as they apply, and imitate   those who come closest to fulfilling this vision (Hebrews   13:7).        Last week (morning and evening) we looked at verses 18-21.   Today we will look at verses 22-25. One of the differences between   the two texts is that last week in verses 18-21 Paul was looking   back and today in verses 22-25 he is looking forward. Last week he   described his past ministry as a model for them to follow (see v.   35). This week he describes his future commitment a model for them   to follow.        It's as though he said, "You know what I was like over the last   three or four years as we worked together. All right, let me show   you what I am like today as I face the future, and what really   matters to me in the years to come.        Paul is not rambling on aimlessly about himself. He is building   his own heart and his life and commitment into the elders. And   that is just as important as his doctrine (which we will focus on   next week).        So today in verses 22-25 Paul talks about his future. And what   he chooses to say is a powerful inspiration for the elders of the   church. I can say as one of the elders of this church that this   testimony of Paul makes me want to sell everything and follow   Jesus. Every time I come back to the radical words of Paul the   chills of obedience go up and down my back and I long to be   utterly un-American and utterly out of step with my secular age   and utterly abandoned to the cause of Christ no matter what!        I have tried to sum up the message of these four verses with   the words, FAITHFULNESS IS BETTER THAN LIFE. I hope you will agree   that this is a fair summary of verse 24: "I do not account my life   of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish   my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus .   . ." Faithfulness to my call is far more important than whether I   live -- live at all not to mention whether I live comfortably!        So what I would like to do is answer two questions using these   verses as the basis for the answers: 1) What does it mean that   faithfulness is better than life? 2) Why is faithfulness better   than life? This is Paul's message to the elders of Ephesus in   these verses and to us today: FAITHFULNESS IS BETTER THAN LIFE.   Especially elders -- but everyone else also -- should count   faithfulness to the calling of Christ as better than the comforts   of life and as better than staying alive.        1. What does it mean that faithfulness is better than life.        1.1 It means being bound by the Holy Spirit to the will of   God.        Verse 22: "And now, behold I am going to Jerusalem, bound in   the Spirit . . ." What does that mean: ". . . bound in the   Spirit"?        You can't tell from the word "Spirit" whether it means Paul's   spirit (bound in the spirit = "feeling a constraint in my spirit")   or God's Spirit (bound by God's Spirit = "constrained and driven   by him"). You have to decide on the basis of context. NASB decides   one way (Paul's: little "s") and the RSV and NIV decide the other   way (God's: big "S"). I think the RSV and NIV are right (see the   instrumental dative with "bound" in 12:6 as well as the use of   "bound" in 9:2; 21:11).        But there may be no big difference in reality, because if you   ask, who is binding Paul's spirit? or, who is constraining him in   this way? the answer would surely be the Spirit of God. So the   point is that Paul is a man under strong conviction and   constraint: his spirit is held captive by the Spirit of God to do   the will of God.        And so here's the first thing to say: believing that   faithfulness is better than life means being bound by the Spirit   to the will of God. Your spirit is gripped. God's Spirit has a   hold of you. And so the will of God is your passion.                    1.2 Second, FAITHFULNESS IS BETTER THAN LIFE means that you are   content not to know in detail what tomorrow will bring.        Verse 22: "And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in   the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there . . ." The   reason Paul says this, is to show us that when "faithfulness is   better than life" you don't need to know about tomorrow's   details.        This is tremendously freeing. If you are a pessimist you   probably dream of a dozen things a day that may go wrong tomorrow   that will make you miserable. "I may not be able to keep my spouse   from leaving. I may not be able to keep my kid out of trouble. I   may not be able to keep my job. I may not be able to close this   sale. I may not be able to win my father to Christ." But this text   means that what God requires of you tomorrow is not that you have   to make things work. Success in human ventures is not the measure   of God on your life. What God requires of you tomorrow is that you   be faithful to him and let the chips fall where he wills. That is   very freeing. And it leads to a third thing:                    1.3 FAITHFULNESS IS BETTER THAN LIFE means you do not forsake   Christ when faithfulness means affliction.        In verse 23 Paul goes on and as says that there is one thing he   does know about tomorrow: ". . . that the Holy Spirit testifies to   me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me."        If you can honestly say with Paul that "faithfulness is better   than life" it will mean not only that you can be content with   ignorance about tomorrow; but you can also be content with the   assurance that tomorrow is going to hurt. This is remarkable!   Someone might counsel us to put out of our mind the high cost of   following Jesus. But the Holy Spirit tells Paul in every city that   bonds and afflictions await him.        Why does Paul tell these Ephesian elders this? To teach them   that it doesn't matter. He's going forward anyway. And that's what   the elders of Bethlehem Baptist Church should do too. The question   is not whether there will be hardship and pain and trouble and   affliction: there will be! Paul said to all the churches in Acts   14:22, "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom."   (Also see 2 Timothy 3:12). The question is whether we believe that   faithfulness is better than life.        1.4 So the final answer in these verses to the question, What   does it mean that faithfulness is better than life? is this: it   means set your face like flint against the American dream.        Verse 22: "And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem." No matter   what the cost! No matter what the impact on my safety and my   standard of living.        But Paul, you're getting old. How 'bout a little cottage on the   Aegean Sea? You've already done more in your ministry than most   people could do in five life times. It's time to rest. Let the   last twenty years of your life be travel and golf and puttering   around. Let Timothy have a chance. He's young. For goodness sake,   don't go to Jerusalem. And don't go to Rome. And give up that   crazy plan at your age to go to Spain. You could get yourself   killed. It isn't . . . American! It's not the American dream of   what to do with the last years of your life.        Faithfulness is better than life! Better than leisure life in   retirement, better than leisure life in the middle years and   better than leisure life in youth. Do you want to hear some of the   definitions of "retire" from my Websters Collegiate Dictionary?   "To withdraw from action or danger." "To fall back." "To go to   bed." "To march away from the enemy." It may be the American   dream, but it has no foundation in Scripture at all.        When your company or Uncle Sam tells you to retire (and of   course they will, just like you may tell me to retire some day),   here's what you should say, "You may call it retirement; but I   call it a change of station. A new front in the warfare. A new   assignment from the King, the Counselor in Chief. I am `going to   Jerusalem'. There is work to be done for the cause of Jesus   Christ, and I will do what I can do while I have breath." Because   faithfulness to the cause is better than a life of comfort.        Why?        2. Why is FAITHFULNESS BETTER THAN LIFE? That's our second   question.        There are at least two answers implied in verses 24 and 25.        2.1 First, "faithfulness is better than life" because   faithfulness means finishing the race and the one who finishes the   race will get the crown.        Paul says in verse 24 "I do not account my life of any value,   nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my   course&yuml;.&yuml;.&yuml;." The word "course" does not mean   school course; it means race course. And "accomplish" means finish   the race without dropping out from weariness or frustration or   pain or pleasant detours.        There is one other place in the Bible where these two words   come together like this, namely, in Paul's second letter to   Timothy 4:7-8. At the end of his life, perhaps six or eight years   after this meeting with the Ephesian elders he writes, "I have   fought the good fight, I have finished the race (same phrase!), I   have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown   of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award   to me on that Day, and not only to me but to all who loved his   appearing."        In other words faithfulness is better than life because beyond   this short life there is a great life of joy that stretches out   forever into eternity. And those who are faithful here will enter   that life and get a crown of righteousness.        "He who endures to the end will be saved" (Matthew 24:13).        "This slight momentary affliction is working for us an eternal   weight of glory beyond all comparison" (2 Corinthians 4:17).        "Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and   utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice   and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven . . ." (Matthew   5:11-12).        "No one has left anything for my sake and the gospel's who will   not receive back a hundred fold . . ." (Matthew 19:29).        "He who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal   life" (John 12:25)        "The gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to   destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is   narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find   it are few" (Matthew 7:13-14).                    Why is faithfulness better than life? Because faithfulness   means finishing the race, and finishing the race means   unimaginable joy for ever and ever and ever. And we know we are on   the right track here because the very last thing Paul says at the   end of this message in verse 35b "Remember the words of the Lord   Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."   That's the first reason why faithfulness is better than life.        That leaves one last question, namely, what was the basis of   Paul's confidence that "faithfulness is better than life"? And   what's the basis for his confidence and ours that faithfulness to   God will bring a future of glory?        2.2 The answer is found in two phrases: one at the end of verse   24 and one near the end of verse 25. The first phrase is "the   gospel of the grace of God." The ministry Paul wants to be   faithful to is the one he received from the Lord Jesus, namely,   "to testify to the gospel of the grace of God."        The second phrase is the phrase "preaching the kingdom" in   verse 25. "And now, behold, I know that all you among whom I have   gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more."        So Paul sums up the content of his life's work with these two   phrases. First: "testifying to the gospel of the grace of God";   and second, "preaching the kingdom." He lived to make known God's   grace and God's kingdom.        So here's the answer to our question: the foundation of his   life and his hope was that God is gracious and that God is King.   And that's the basis of our confidence that FAITHFULNESS IS BETTER   THAN LIFE: if God is King then he CAN reward the faithful, and   nothing can stop him in his kingly power. If God is gracious then   he WILL reward the faithful.        So the message stands firm today -- as firm and sure as the   sovereignty and grace of God in Jesus Christ: FAITHFULNESS IS   BETTER THAN LIFE. So I urge you, let God's word and not the word   of the world determine what you feel is better in your life.        Copyright 1989,1998 John Piper      Piper's   Notes
