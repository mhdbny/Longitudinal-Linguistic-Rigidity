 April 2, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    A.M. &amp; P.M. Messages    John Piper, Pastor            Serving the Lord with Humility tears and trials    (Acts 20:17-21)        And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders   of the church. And when they came to him, he said to them: "You   yourselves know how I lived among you all the time from the first   day that I set foot in Asia, serving the Lord with all humility   and with tears and with trials which befell me through the plots   of the Jews; how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything   that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to   house, testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance to God   and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.           The Book of Acts is a fast moving account of the spread of the   Gospel through the Roman Empire in the first thirty years after   Christ's resurrection. But now and then Luke stops his fast moving   story and let's us hear a sermon. So he inspires us with the   spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Judea to Samaria to the   reaches of the empire. But he also stops to teach us what kind of   doctrine and preaching and leadership was behind this wonderful   advance of the kingdom.        In Acts 18:23 Paul sets out from Antioch on his third and final   missionary journey. He travels up through Galatia and Phrygia   (today's Turkey) strengthening the disciples that he had made on   his first journey.        In Acts 19:1 he arrives in Ephesus. Verses 8 says that he spent   the first three months arguing and pleading with the Jewish   community about the kingdom of God. But the opposition became so   intense Paul moved out of the synagogue and for two years argued   daily in the Hall of Tyranus. During these two years amazing   things happened.        God did many miracles of healing and exorcism through Paul.   People were delivered from the occult and burned books worth   50,000 pieces of silver. Paul's success in evangelism was so great   that the silversmiths who made silver shrines for the goddess   Artemis feared their business and even the temple of Artemis   itself were in danger of being ruined. So they stirred up a riot.   Paul leaves town then after more than two years of ministry. He   calls it three years in Acts 20:31.        He goes up through Macedonia, and down into Greece and spends   three winter months probably in Corinth (20:3). Then he heads back   up through Macedonia in the spring, crosses over to Troas, where   he preaches all night long and Eutychus fell asleep and fell out   of the window (20:9). He sails on south and passes Ephesus in the   boat because he is in a hurry to get to Jerusalem by Pentecost   (20:16).        But he puts in at Miletus about 20 miles south of Ephesus and   sends for the Elders of the church in Ephesus (v. 17). This helps   put Paul's words here in the right light. He is in a hurry to get   to Jerusalem by Pentecost and is cutting it close. He is in a boat   well out to sea. He seems to be in charge of the itinerary (20:16   - he is the one who decides to sail past Ephesus). And he orders   the captain to navigate into the Miletus harbor, sends a messenger   over the 20 some miles back up to Ephesus, and waits for the   elders of the church so that he can say to them what we read in   Acts 20:17-35.        The fact that Paul would go to this much trouble to give this   message to the elders of the church personally and the fact that   Luke would pause in his story and record the words for us make   them very wonderful words to me. I am deeply moved by this speech.   They show us so much of Paul's heart as well as his theology and   his view of leadership. The ending of this message is heart   wrenching as he weeps with these friends and kisses them because   he will never see them again until heaven.        Now why were these words so important?        One answer -- the one that we focus on today -- is that the   future of the Ephesian church hangs on how its elders serve the   Lord, and that's what Paul talks about here. No doubt Paul would   have loved to see the whole church in Ephesus. But his strength   and schedule dictated that he limit himself to the one thing that   was indispensable -- talking to the church elders. As the elders   go so goes the church in Ephesus.        So before Paul gives any instruction or warnings in verses   28-31 he simply reminds them how he served the Lord in those three   years they had together. That's what we want to look at today.        It's plain from verse 35 that Paul's aim in reminding them   about his own ministry was to instruct them about theirs: "In all   things I have shown you that by so toiling one must help the weak   . . ." Note: "I have shown you!" My life has been my lesson for   how to lead the flock of God.        So when we read verses 18-21 we ought not think that these are   just interesting reminiscences. They are much more than that. They   are Paul's way of saying, here's how to serve the Lord for the   good of the church. Here's what you elders need to do. Here is   what Bethlehem's elders need to be like, and what the people at   Bethlehem need to pray into their leaders. Indeed what you all   should imitate as it applies to you (Hebrews 13:17).        So let's look at what Paul says about his ministry. Keep in   mind that he has to be honest, because these were the men who had   watched him for three years. This is what you should look for:   what are the marks of a good church elder? What kind of leadership   does the church need? What does it mean to "serve the Lord"   biblically?        Verse 19: "You yourselves know how I lived among you all the   time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, serving the Lord   . . ."        The first thing that Paul wants to say about his work is that   he was serving the Lord. Now that seems to be a simple idea --   serving the Lord. But think about it a minute. "Serving" -- what   comes to your mind? Doing what you're told. Lowliness.   Submissiveness. Compliance. Deference.        But now what comes to your mind when you say, "The Lord"? Not   "A Lord" or "My Lord", but "The Lord!" Authority. Power.   Rulership. Control. Majesty.        Now when you put these two together there is an unusual kind of   leadership that is created. Some characteristics of this   leadership come from the fact that the leader is first a servant.   And some characteristics come from the fact that he serves "the   Lord" and when the Lord tells him to say a thing or do a thing he   says it and does it with amazing confidence and authority. Now can   you put those two things together? Can you picture what that would   look like in the elders of the church?        I certainly would not trust myself to spell out what that would   look like without more help from the Bible. This is why I have   very little confidence in people who claim to be speaking   Biblically when they simply take a Biblical theme (say "justice"   or "peace" or "servanthood" or "equality") and, having seen the   theme, they shut their Bibles and start talking about the theme as   though what they were saying had the authority of the Bible behind   it.        Well, the Bible is so full of surprises and unexpected notions   and strange ideas of reality that we must be very careful. For   example, right here instead of thinking that we know what serving   the Lord would look like, we ought to slow down and get very   serious about focusing on just what Paul says about his service.   That's what I want to do in the time we have left.        Everything that follows from verse 18 through 21 is one   sentence in the original. It's Paul's way of spelling out how he   served the Lord. In fact there are at least eleven characteristics   of serving the Lord mentioned here. What a shame if we were to   just say, "Elders should serve the Lord," and then close our   Bibles and tell stories about what that might mean in our   experience.        Let's keep our Bibles open and look at three of Paul's   illustrations this morning, and the rest tonight.        1. Verse 19a: Serving the Lord means lowliness. "Serving the   Lord with all lowliness (humility)."        The first thing Paul has to say is that being a servant of the   Lord means being humble and lowly. Lowliness or humility is first   a feeling toward God that he has absolute rights over your life --   that he can do with you as he pleases and that he has absolute   authority to tell you what is best for you -- and that's just fine   with you. It is a spirit of utter yieldedness and submissiveness   to the Lord as master. Clay in the Potter's hands.        Secondly, lowliness means feeling indebted to all people   because of how graciously God has treated us. It's the opposite of   feeling that everybody owes you something -- owes you an ear or   owes you strokes or owes you time. Now, of course, there are   relationships in which those things may be true -- someone may in   fact owe you something. But the more you are driven by what others   owe you rather than by what you owe them in love and service, the   less lowly you are.        Lowliness says, I am a debtor to Greeks and barbarians, to wise   and foolish, to friend and foe. Lowliness does not think in terms   of its rights. It empties itself and takes the form a servant and   becomes obedient unto death, even death on a cross.        The first thing that serving the Lord means is lowliness.        2. Verse 19a: Serving the Lord means TEARS. "Serving the Lord   with all humility and with tears."        Tears can come from physical pain or from heartrending loss, or   from unbearable frustrations and discouragements or from intense   yearning or from overwhelming joy. I don't know which Paul had in   mind here. In verse 31 he says, "I did not cease night or day to   admonish everyone with tears." So in that case his tears were the   tears of intense yearning for their faith and holiness.        But he doesn't say here in verse 19 why he cried so often. What   should we learn then? If these tears were simply owing to a kind   of emotional weakness in Paul, they wouldn't have too much   meaning. He wouldn't mention them as part of his credentials. No,   I think what we should learn is that serving the Lord means   getting so intensely involved in people's struggles that you cry   over them.        Now I am a Christian Hedonist? Okay? So you won't take what I   am about to say wrongly -- as though I were bellyaching or   pleading for pity that I happen to be in the greatest work in the   world. But between the time I left home as a teenager in 1964 and   the time I became a teaching elder -- a pastor -- of this church   in 1980, I think I could have counted on one hand the number of   times I cried (in 16 years!). But since I became one of the   shepherds of this flock I cry a lot more. And it doesn't get less   as the years go by.        So a text like this gives me a great deal of comfort. I am not   an apostle Paul. Verse 31 says he admonished with tears day and   night! Maybe that will come someday. I think I have some growing   to do yet before that privilege will be granted.        So the second mark of service is this: Serving the Lord as an   elder in the church of God will mean tears, because it will mean   getting involved in people's struggles for faith and hope and   truth and holiness.        3. Verse 19b: Serving the Lord means TRIALS. "Serving the Lord   with all lowliness and with tears and with trials which befell me   through the plots of the Jews."        Now why does Paul remind the elders about these dangers that he   went through? The answer is that they will have to go through them   too. Consider this: in 1 Corinthians 15:32 Paul said, "Humanly   speaking I fought with beasts at Ephesus?" What did he mean? Well   compare Acts 20:29, "I know that after my departure fierce wolves   will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your   own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away   the disciples after them. Therefore, be alert . . ."        Paul said he had to fight with beasts in Ephesus. And he says   that the Ephesian elders will have to fight with fierce wolves.   The point is the same in both cases, and its the same thing Jesus   meant when he said, "Behold I send you out as sheep in the midst   of wolves" (Matthew 10:16). There are people who when they hear   the absolute claims of Jesus Christ become so angry they are like   animals.        And the tragic thing is that in Acts 20:29 Paul says that these   wolves will even come from among their own number! In other words   some elders themselves in the church at Ephesus will become the   enemies of truth and righteousness. They will speak perverse   things about the message and life of the other elders. They may   even plot against them like Paul's kinsmen plotted against him   (20:3;19:9). And Paul says this is a great trial.        So we have seen that serving the Lord means three things. It   means humility, tears, and trials. And I want to call you to serve   the Lord in these ways in your particular sphere.        Humility: Be utterly yielded to the Lord. Be submissive to his   absolute rights to control your life. Be willing clay in the   Potter's hands. And be a debtor to all people. Don't dwell on what   people owe you. Think about how the grace of God makes you a   debtor to all.        Tears: If you are shedding them, be comforted. You are in good   company with Paul. And if you are not, perhaps you should look for   someone who needs you. Or perhaps pray that God would help you see   what is at stake in the battle for faith and hope and   holiness.        TRIALS: If you are being tried, then hear the word of James:   Count it all joy brothers when you fall into various trials,   knowing that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And   let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect   and complete, lacking in nothing.        
        How to Serve the Lord as an Elder    (Continuing the morning message of 4-2-89)                    On the first three see the morning message        1) Serving the Lord means humility. (Verse 19)        2) Serving the Lord means tears. (Verse 19)        3) Serving the Lord means trials. (Verse 19)        4) Serving the Lord means COURAGE. (Verse 20)        "How I did not shrink back from . . ."        See Acts 20:27 (not shrink back from declaring the whole   counsel of God); Galatians 2:12 (Peter shrinks back from eating   with Gentiles because of fear); Hebrews 10:38f (shrinking back   from a persevering life of faith and obedience).        Putting vv. 20 and 27 together it seems that there are parts to   the whole counsel of God that are profitable but evidently not   easy to teach about. Just like some medicine is good for you but   may not go down easily.        A good elder does not decide what to teach by what is popular   or easily accepted. If it is part of God's counsel it ought to be   taught because it will be profitable. This takes courage.        It also takes study and thought. See Titus 1:9 where the elders   are to "hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that   &#91;you&#93; may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine   and also to confute those who contradict it." If something is   going to be controversial and encounter those who contradict it,   the elders must do their homework and be able to give reasonable   answers.        Not shrinking back implies courage to give something less than   popular and confidence that enough study and insight will provide   reasonable answers to those who question it.        5. Serving the Lord means sometimes proclaiming.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you . . ."        The Greek word anaggello means something different from "teach"   which follows. It is what you do when you announce or proclaim or   report or herald. In other words the emphasis does not fall on   explaining the meaning or the implications of a passage of   Scripture; the emphasis falls on bringing news or announcing a   happening or heralding some coming event or proclaiming a   victory.        There is a difference between explaining to someone how to play   hockey and bringing the news that Minnesota beat Harvard. There is   a difference between what the announcer does during the game and   what happens at half-time when an analyst comes on with   diagrams.        There is a place and a need for both proclamation and teaching,   because Christian truth is not just knowledge to be analyzed and   understood; it is a vision of reality to be savored and enjoyed.   We need to hear a kind of announcement of the truth of Scripture   that corresponds to the emotional weight of the truth. This is the   difference between preaching and teaching in my understanding of   the two words.        Not all elders need to be good proclaimers, or preachers. But   all should have a heart to announce the good news when appropriate   and should have a love of having it announced as well as   analyzed.        6. Serving the Lord means LIVING FOR WHAT PROFITS THE   CHURCH.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable . . ."        A good "proclaiming elder" does not make decisions about his   preaching merely on the basis of what he finds easy or familiar;   he asks, what will profit the people?        And here he has to know what profit is. Is it self-esteem? Is   it money? Is it soothed consciences? Jeremiah spoke against   prophets and priests who "healed the wound of my people lightly,   saying Peace, Peace, when there was no peace" (6:14; 8:11).        True, eternal profit is the goal, not temporary peace and   comfort. 'What will do the people everlasting good?' is the   constant question of the faithful elders.        7. Serving the Lord means BEING APT TO TEACH.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable, and teaching you . . ."        In the list of qualifications for elders in 1 Timothy 3:2 it   says that he should be "an apt teacher." He should have the gift   of teaching. The reason for this is that the elders are charged   with being the doctrinal guardians of the flock, to preserve true   doctrine and defend it and build it into the people. In Titus 1:9   elders are to "hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he   may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to   confute those who contradict it."        Teaching is different from "proclaiming" in that it takes the   word proclaimed, or a portion of scripture and more or less   methodically explains it. Teaching emphasizes making the sense   plain. Nehemiah 8:8, "And they read from the book, from the law of   God, clearly; and they gave the sense, so that the people   understood the reading."        Good teaching and good proclaiming will generally include some   of the other.        A strong church must be a taught church. God wills for there to   be pastor-teachers in the body of Christ (Ephesians&yuml;4:11).   Two years or more he taught the disciples as well as proclaiming   to newcomers.        8. Serving the Lord means A PUBLIC MINISTRY.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable, and teaching you in public . . ."        Demosia in Greek seems to mean having to do with the populace   in general ("public prison" Acts 5:18) or having to do with being   out in the open for all to see ("they have beaten us publicly"   Acts 16:37).        So Paul is emphasizing that his ministry to the disciples and   elders was not all private. It was often open to everyone. There   was free access -- probably referring to the Hall of Tyranus (Acts   19:9).        The point may be that Christian truth is public truth. It is   nothing to be ashamed of. It is nothing to hide. It is not like   the gnostic rites then or like the Masonic rites today. It is open   and above board.        All elders ought to be that way. No teaching that has to be   kept secret.        9. Serving the Lord means A PERSONAL MINISTRY.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house . .   ."        Here is where we got the name of our small group ministry, "The   20:20 Vision."        Paul was not content to always be speaking to a large public   crowd where things necessarily were somewhat more impersonal. He   evidently divided the church into house groups and went to those   groups. Or it may mean going to visit particular families.        Since he is teaching, however, the focus is not so much on   socializing, but on smaller times when the word could be more   closely applied and perhaps more detailed and personal questions   could be asked.        Compare Acts 5:42 -- same phrase: the apostles "in the temple   and from house to house (kat' oikon) they did not cease teaching   and proclaiming (euaggelizomenoi) the Christ, Jesus."        This implies the need for elders to not only be gifted teachers   but gifted in the ability to explain and apply the word personally   and helpfully in a variety of personal settings.        10. Serving the Lord means SPIRITUAL INTENSITY.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,   (21) testifying . . ."        The Greek word diamarturomenos sometimes means bear witness, in   the sense of taking an oath in court and testifying of what you   know of an event. But it has come to mean charge or warn or tell   with a gravity or solemnity because the matter is very   serious.        So Paul's use of the word here and in verse 24 implies that he   was in dead earnest about this matter of repentance and faith.        Earnestness and seriousness and spiritual intensity are crucial   in the leadership of the church. It's the opposite of levity and   its the opposite of a kind of official churchy talk that has no   sense of ultimate reality in it. Elders need to communicate the   greatness of the eternal things they are dealing with in the word   of God and prayer and people's souls.        11. Serving the Lord means BEING IMPARTIAL.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,   (21) testifying both to Jews and Greeks . . ."        Elders should not be partial to one group of people over   another in the sense that he belittles one. An elder may be   assigned to give special attention to the youth or to the elderly   or to families or to single people. That open and delegated   responsibility is not partiality.        But an elder who slights a group in the church because he   dislikes them is contrary to Paul's example here. The spiritual   welfare of all in the community should be the concern of a   Christlike elder.        12. Serving the Lord means URGING REPENTANCE TO GOD.        See on #13.        13. Serving the Lord means URGING FAITH IN JESUS.        "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was   profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,   (21) testifying both to Jews and Greeks of repentance to God and   faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."                    Finally we get to the content of what Paul was proclaiming and   teaching and testifying -- repentance to God and faith in   Jesus.        Both are necessary for salvation.        Repentance:        Acts 3:19, "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins   may be blotted out." (See 2:38)        Acts 5:31, "God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and   Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."        Acts 8:22, "Repent, therefore of this wickedness of yours, and   pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may   be forgiven you."        Acts 11:18, "When they heard this they were silenced. And they   glorified God, saying, 'Then to the Gentiles also God has granted   repentance unto life.'"        Acts 17:30, "The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he   commands all men everywhere to repent."        Acts 26: 17-20 (This is first Paul's commission from the risen   Lord Jesus and then how Paul preached from it.) "I will appear to   you (17) delivering you from the people and from th Gentiles -- to   whom I send you (18) to open their eyes, that they may turn from   darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they   may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are   sanctified by faith in me.        (19) "Wherefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the   heavenly vision, (20) but declared first to those at Damascus,   then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and   also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and   perform deeds worthy of their repentance."        Faith        Note the bridge to faith from repentance in 26:18!        Acts 14:27, "And when they arrived, they gathered the church   together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he   had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles." (Compare 11:18)        Acts 15:9, "And he made no distinction between us and them, but   cleansed their hearts by faith."        Acts 24:24-25, "After some days Felix came with his wife   Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul and heard him   speak upon faith in Christ Jesus. (25) And as he argued about   justice and self-control and future judgment, Felix was alarmed   ..."        Copyright 1989, 1998 John Piper      Piper's   Notes
