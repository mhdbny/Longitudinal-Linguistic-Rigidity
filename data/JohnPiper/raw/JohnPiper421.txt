  November 6, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       CITIES OF RUTHLESS NATIONS WILL REVERE THEE    (Isaiah 25:1-8)        O Lord, Thou art my God; I will exaltThee, I will      give thanks to Thy name; for Thou hast worked wonders, plans      formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness. For Thou hast made      a city into a heap, a fortified city into in ruin; a palace of      strangers is a city no more, it will never be rebuilt.      Therefore a strong people will glorify Thee; cities of ruthless      nations will revere Thee. For Thou hast been a defense for the      helpless, a defense for the needy in his distress, a refuge      from the storm, a shade from the heat; for the breath of the      ruthless is like a rain storm against a wall. Like a heat in      drought, Thou dost subdue the uproar of aliens; like heat by      the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced.      And the Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all      peoples on this mountain; a banquet of aged wine, choice pieces      with marrow, and refined, aged wine. And on this mountain He      will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, even      the veil which is stretched over all nations. He will swallow      up death for all time, and the Lord God will wipe tears away      from all faces, and He will remove the reproach of His people      from all the earth; for the Lord hasspoken.         We have always believed at Bethlehem that a great and   indispensable motivation in world missions is HOPE. By hope I mean   the confidence that we are engaged in a cause that will triumph in   the end. No life laid down in the cause of world evangelization is   laid down in vain. No dollar given is in vain. No sermon preached   is in vain. No prayer offered is in vain. No candle of gospel   light is ever lit in vain. Our energy and sacrifice and focus is   sustained by HOPE -- the confidence that God's kingdom will   triumph in the world.       This passage in Isaiah is a picture of that hope. Don't worry   that you can't answer all the timing questions and all the detail   questions about how the triumph of God will eventually come. This   text doesn't answer all our questions about the end. What Old   Testament prophets do again and again is give us a picture of the   final day of victory -- from one angle and then from another   angle. Each time the aim is that we take heart, give God the glory   and press on in hope-filled allegiance to Christ and hope-filled   missions.       So what I want to do this morning is focus our attention for a   few minutes on this picture of God's victory, then jump to the New   Testament where the power of God begins to triumph in a particular   Roman city, and then jump to Bethlehem as a support base for   missions in this city and around the world.       Isaiah's Vision of God's Victory       First then, let's look at what Isaiah sees. What he sees   stretches from eternity past to eternity future. It is a huge   vision. Look first at verse 1: "O Lord, Thou art my God; I will   exalt Thee, I will give thanks to Thy name; for Thou hast worked   wonders, plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness." Here's   where I get the idea that Isaiah's vision stretches into eternity   past: God had made plans "long ago in perfect faithfulness." And   now he is bringing his plans to pass in working wonders.       God is a planning God. He gives forethought to what he does. He   is wise. And if you believe that he is all-knowing, then he is   never playing catchup ball. He takes all his knowledge into   account in making all his plans. He is never caught off guard. If   a football team wins with a 50 yard field goal in the last three   seconds you might call that a minor wonder. But in God's case,   Isaiah says, his wonders are planned. If he wins in the last three   seconds of the battle with an arrow shot on a venture, he planned   it that way. God never "gets lucky." Isaiah likes to stress this   (cf. 46:9-10). It gives God more glory than if his wonders had to   fit into the random flow of history without plan.       Then look at verses 6-8 to see Isaiah's glimpse into eternity   future. Robert Burns the Scottish poet once said that he could   never read these verses, especially verse 8, without tears. They   are one of the most remarkable prophesies in all the Old   Testament.       And the Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all   peoples &#91;NOTE: all the peoples!&#93; on this mountain; a   banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, and refined, aged   wine. 7 And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which   is over all peoples, even the veil which is stretched over all   nations &#91;the veil represents sorrow and mourning, which is   explained in the next verse&#93;. 8 He will swallow up death for   all time, and the Lord God will wipe tears away from all faces,   and He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth;   for the Lord has spoken.       So Isaiah sees the day coming when all the nations --   representatives from all the people groups -- will no longer be at   odds with Yahweh, the God of Israel and his Messiah, whom we know   to be Jesus. They will no longer worship Bel or Nebo or Mollech or   Allah or Buddha or utopian social programs or capitalistic growth   possibilities or ancestors or animistic spirits. Instead they will   come to in faith the banquet on God's mountain. And they will have   the veil of sorrow removed and death shall be swallowed up and the   reproach of God's people will be removed and tears shall be gone   for ever.       That's the setting for understanding the vision of verse 3:   "Therefore a strong people will glorify Thee; Cities of ruthless   nations will revere Thee." In other words God is stronger than the   "strong people" and he is so powerful and so gracious that in the   end he will turn ruthless nations to revere him. This is part of   what verse 6 means when it says that God will prepare a banquet   for "all peoples" -- all peoples including the strong people and   the ruthless nations that had opposed him and worshipped idols and   fought against his people.       So the picture Isaiah gives us is one of all nations turned to   God in worship, a great banquet for all the peoples, the removal   of all suffering and grief and reproach from the nations who have   become his people, and the final putting away of death for ever.   This triumph is sure because God is doing it. As verse one says he   planned it long ago and he is working wonders to bring it to pass.   Therefore we can be certain of it. Not one life spent in the cause   of world evangelization is spent in vain. Not one prayer or one   dollar or one sermon or one letter of encouragement mailed or one   little light shining in some dark place -- nothing in the cause of   the advancing kingdom is in vain. The triumph is sure.       The New Testament       What moved us to choose this picture of hope for Missions Fest   '94 is the reference to cities in verse 3: "Cities of ruthless   nations will revere thee." This seemed to be significant to the   apostle Paul in his missionary strategy in the first century, and   it is increasingly significant to us in a world where the nations   are moving to the cities in unprecedented ways.       So let's jump now to the new Testament. Paul's mission strategy   was to go from city to city and plant the church. From the city   the surrounding area was evangelized. For example in Acts 19:10   Luke says that because of Paul's two year investment in Ephesus   "all Asia heard the word of the Lord."       Let's take one example and apply it to Bethlehem. When Paul was   in Asia Minor (Turkey) in Troas, he saw the vision of the man   saying "Come over into Macedonia and help us" (Acts 16:9). Here's   the way Luke describes Paul's strategy as he sailed across the 100   miles or so of the northern Agean Sea:        Setting sail from Troas, we made a directvoyage to      Samothrace &#91;a little island on the way&#93;, and the      following day to Neapolis &#91;the coastal city, but not the      main city&#93;, and from there to Philippi, which is the      leading city of the district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony.      We remained in this city some days.         And then Luke devotes a whole chapter, Acts 16, to what   happened in this leading city and Roman colony of Macedonia.       It was a city on the Ignatian Way -- the main highway across   Macedonia between Asia and Italy. It was a city of nations. It was   strategic politically and geographically. And it was without God.   It was pagan and diverse. There was the imperial cult that deified   the Caesar. There were the Greek gods with their temples and   altars and Latin names: Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Mars. Artemis had   her cult under the name Bendis. And there were sanctuaries to the   gods of Egypt, especially Isis and Serapis, as well as the   Phrygian Cybele known as the great mother-goddess. It was, to use   the words of Isaiah, a city of ruthless nations that Paul wanted   to see revere God.       So he focused his evangelistic effort there, and a church was   planted. Paul wrote one of his most affectionate letters to them.   From what he says they seemed to be the church that supported him   financially better than any other (Phil. 4:15). And archaeological   evidence shows that the church was there in the 2nd-4th centuries   and two large basilicas have been uncovered from the 5th or 6th   century. Many had come to revere the true God in this city of   nations.       Bethlehem Baptist       Now to connect this city to Bethlehem turn with me to 2   Corinthians 8:1-2. I wrote about this in the Star this week so as   to give it a double impact. Let me explain the connection in my   mind before I read it.       About two weeks ago I was praying about our financial situation   at the church seeking some encouragement and assurance from the   Lord that we could actually meet our total and mission commitments   this year in view of the fact that we still need something less   than $400,000 by year's end. This is the farthest behind we have   ever been at this point in the year. The main reason is plain. We   have lost a significant number of givers this year.       I believe the Lord led me to this passage in 2 Corinthians   because of a few remarkable parallels with our situation. These   verses are a description of what the grace of God did in   Macedonia, especially Philippi when Paul focused his evangelism on   that city of pagan nations.       Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God   which has been given in the churches of Macedonia &#91;i.e.,   Philippi!&#93;, 2 that in a great ordeal of affliction their   abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth   of their liberality.       In other words Paul describes the triumph of God's grace (v.1!)   in this city in terms of how the new Christians became generous   with their money in supporting Paul's mission, and especially his   collection for Jerusalem.       As this city of ruthless nations comes under the powerful sway   of God's grace, a very strange kind of math happens: It goes like   this. You can see it in verse 2:       

Great ordeal of affliction       + Deep poverty       + Abundance of Joy    ____________________________       = Wealth of liberality       Verse 2: "In a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of   joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their   liberality." This is strange: affliction plus poverty plus joy   equals great generosity. The name of that math is supernatural   "grace".       The parallel with our situation is striking: We have been   through "a great ordeal of affliction." As a result there is a   kind of "poverty" -- numerous givers are gone. So we qualify for   two of the three components of this math: affliction and   (comparative) "poverty" (even though we are very wealthy by world   standards!).       The big question is, will the third component in the equation   take place this fall at Bethlehem -- Abundance of Joy? Affliction   + poverty + joy = generosity.       Here's the answer of the staff.       I told them two weeks ago that we need another $400,000 to meet   our expenses this year (not counting the building fund). I   explained that after subtracting the children and the departures   are subtracted from our regular giving units (= envelope boxes),   there are about 500 left.       $400,000 divided by 500 = $800. That's what each giving unit at   Bethlehem would need to give on average by the end of the year --   not above what you already give, just total giving. I realize that   $800 between now and the end of the year is like tithing on an   annual salary of $48,000 (which most our units don't make). But my   guess is that a lot of the 500 units have not been tithing during   the year, and $800 would only catch them up to where they perhaps   should have been. Others will go far beyond their tithe. Others   will have to give less than $800 and God will see it as more (and   treat it like loaves and fishes).       All this does not take into account the unpredictable gifts   that come to us from outside the church. This is always one of   God's wonderful wildcards.       I asked the staff to pray and make pledges for this year-end   effort, and give it to me anonymously. I have 17 commitments in   hand. The average is $1,069.70 per giving unit for the rest of the   year (33% above the $800 needed). This includes pastors,   assistants, receptionists, custodians.       I hope this remarkable commitment of the staff to the future of   our church releases in you the crucial component of God's math   called GRACE: abundance of joy. I hope you will join us in this   strange and wonderful math.       Bethlehem is not content to merely sustain a local ministry to   each other, though we believe that is crucial. We are de facto a   mission. We are a support base for people in at least 18   countries. We are a mission. Here are the numbers to demonstrate   it.       The missions portion of our budget has grown from an actual   disbursement in 1982 of $71,473 to $452,550 in 1993, more than a   six-fold increase.       The missions percentage of the budget has risen from 22% in   1982 to 34% last year. These are actual numbers, not just   projections.       But perhaps the most significant statistic is this one: While   the percentage for missions has increased from 22% to 34% of the   budget, the percentage for pastors' and staff compensation between   1982 and 1993 has decreased from 52% to 43%.       What this means is that the grace of God described in 2   Corinthians 8:1-2 has also been manifest in our midst. We are the   beneficiaries of immense undeserved blessing and power. God has   graced us in spite of all our sin. He loves his mission.       We have every reason to be confident in him and joyful in him.   The staff are committed 133% to you and to this mission. We have   put our money where our ministry is. We would like you to join us   -- first in the joy, then in the giving.       Great affliction + deep poverty + abundant joy = great   generosity.       The key to this joy will be the vision of Isaiah 25: that the   cause of God we are investing in cannot fail. All the nations will   turn to God in worship. God will spread a great banquet for all   the peoples. Cities of ruthless nations will revere him. He will   remove all suffering and grief and reproach from his people; and   he will put away death for ever.       Therefore, when it comes to world missions not one life, not   one prayer, or one dollar, or one sermon, or one letter of   encouragement, or one little light shining in some dark place --   nothing in the cause of God's advancing kingdom will ever be vain.
