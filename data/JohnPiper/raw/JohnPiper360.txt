 October 11, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       BEAUTIFYING THE BODY OF CHRIST    (Ephesians 5:22-32)         Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the      Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also      is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the      body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives      ought to be to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love      your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave      Himself up for her; that He might sanctify her, having cleansed      her by the washing of water with the word, that He might      present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot      or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she should be holy and      blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as      their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for      no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes      it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members      of His body. For this cause a man shall leave his father and      mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become      one flesh. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with      reference to Christ and the church.                Two weeks ago we talked about one aspect of the mystery of   Christ mentioned in Ephesians 3:4, namely, the truth that in Jesus   the Messiah even Gentiles, not just Jews, are part of God's people   and are full fellow citizens with believing Jews in the true   Israel, the body of Christ. This is a mystery not because it is   unintelligible, but because it was kept secret for centuries while   God focussed his saving work and his special self-revelation on   the Jewish people. Now it is revealed in the gospel. In the cross   Christ reconciles Jew and Gentile to God in one body (Eph.   2:16).        Now today we look at the mystery of Christ and his body from   another angle. And the mystery is simply this: the meaning of   human marriage is based on another greater marriage designed by   God in heaven before creation, namely, the marriage of Christ to   the church.        We see this in verses 28-32. Paul says in verse 28-29 that   "husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who   loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own   flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does   the church, because we are members of his body." What Paul says   there is that a husband's loving his wife is like loving himself   because she is like his own body. And Christ's loving the church   is like his loving himself because we are part of his body. So   there is a comparison here: a husband's oneness with his wife is   like Christ's oneness with his church.        Then in verse 31 Paul quotes Genesis 2:24, "For this cause a   man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his   wife; and the two shall become one flesh." In other words, the   reason a man's love to his wife is like love to himself is because   in the beginning God designed marriage so that a "one flesh" union   would be created. If Noel and I are one flesh because of the   covenant of marriage, then my love to her is in a profound sense a   love to me.        Now that much was not a mystery in the Old Testament. That much   was revealed in the text of Genesis 2:24. Husband and wife are one   flesh. Yet Paul says in verse 32, "This mystery is great." So   what's the mystery? He goes on to define it: "But I am speaking   with reference to Christ and the church." The mystery not revealed   fully in the Old Testament was that the one-flesh union of human   marriage is a picture of the one-flesh union of Christ and his   church.        So the new angle on the mystery of Christ that we see today is   not what we've seen before--that the body of Christ is the   fullness of him who fills all in all (1:23) or that the body is   made up of both Jews and Gentiles who trust Christ (3:6)--but the   new angle on the mystery of Christ today is that the church is the   body of Christ because she is the wife of Christ, and husbands and   wives are one flesh, one body.        So if we want to know who we are today as the church, the body   of Christ--if we want to know what it means to be the church and   to live like the church--then we need to learn from this passage   what it means to be the wife of Christ. What does it mean to have   Christ as our husband?        I see at least five things that it means for us to be the wife   of Christ. Three of them we will take up this morning and two this   evening.         1. It means first that Christ loved us before we were   attractive.         Verse 25: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved   the church and gave himself up for her." Notice the order here.   It's very important. He loved, and that love moved him to give   himself. And verse 26 says that the aim of the self-giving was to   sanctify and to cleanse, and verse 27 shows that the effect of   that sanctifying is getting rid of spots and wrinkles and making   the church beautiful with glory. So the love preceded the   beautification.        In other words, Christ did not choose his wife the way we do.   He did not look for an attractive woman or an intelligent woman or   a even a faithful woman. He chose an unlikely woman. And then he   set out to make her attractive and wise and faithful at the cost   of his own life.        His love for us did not begin as the love of admiration. His   first love for us was not a response to our beauty. We had none.   His first love for us was free and unconditional.        It is the love of unconditional election described in Ephesians   1:4, "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that   we should be holy and blameless before him." We were not chosen   because he could see we were holy; he chose us because he planned   to make us holy.        We have been loved with the love of unconditional regeneration   described in Ephesians 2:4-5, "But God, being rich in mercy,   because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we   were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with   Christ, (by grace you have been saved)." God chose a dead woman to   be his Son's wife. Dead women do not begin by fulfilling   conditions. They begin by being raised from the dead, or being   born again.        That is what happened to every member of the body of Christ.   Before we could look pretty, or sound wise, or be faithful, the   electing love of God chose us and the regenerating love of God   raised us from the dead.        Now ponder this for a moment. God means for my wife Noel to   experience and to enjoy and to be strengthened and secured by a   love coming from me, her husband, that is peculiar to her, and   different from the general Christian love I may have for any other   woman in the world. The love of a man for a wife is a   distinguishing covenant love that is shared by no other woman in   his life.        But one of the great theological and experiential tragedies in   the church today--and one of the great sources of weakness in the   church--is that Christians have learned to enjoy a love from God   that is no more peculiar and precious and securing and endearing   and distinguishing than the general love that God has for all the   world, even those who perish in unbelief. For two hundred years   the church in America has slipped farther and farther away from   the glorious truth that the wife of the Son of God is loved with   an electing, regenerating, distinguishing, covenant love that is   different from God's love for the world that is not his wife.        O God loves the world--such that he gave his only begotten Son   that whosoever believes on him shall not perish but have   everlasting life (John 3:16). But it is a great sadness when a   wife only knows herself loved with the love that her husband has   for every woman. The marriage between Christ and his wife is   weak--and the church is weak--to the degree that she only feels   loved with the same love that allows others in the world to   perish. As though there were no peculiar love that chose her and   raised her to life and made a covenant with her never to turn away   from doing her good.        So the first thing it means for us to be the wife of Christ is   that Christ loved us before we were attractive. He loved us and   loves us still with a peculiar, distinguishing, electing,   regenerating, covenant love. To know this, to have the Spirit   testifying of it in your heart, is precious and powerful beyond   words.         2. The second thing it means to be the wife of Christ   is that Christ gave himself for his wife the church.         Verse 25: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved   the church and gave himself up for her."        Again Christ did not win his wife the way men do today. He paid   a dowry for her and the dowry was his life. To be the wife of   Christ means to be loved not only with an electing love that   chooses us before the foundation of the world and not only with a   regenerating love that raises us to life when we were dead in our   trespasses and sins, but also with a self-sacrificing love that   dies for us (as Romans 5:7-10 says) while we were helpless and   sinful and ungodly and enemies.        In other words, he did not simply die for an unworthy woman or   for a reluctant woman, but for a woman who found him repulsive.   Now don't miss the force of this. Paul says in verse 25 that   Christ gave himself for the church. In other words, in his dying   he had the church especially in view. It was for her--uniquely for   her, especially for her, peculiarly for her--that he died. The   powerful saving, cleansing, sanctifying, beautifying effects of   the cross were directed to a fianc&eacute;e who not only was   unattractive in herself, but who found Christ himself repulsive   and did not have any intention of marrying him. Specifically for   her he gave his life. For us. That is what it means to be the wife   of Christ.         3. Third, being the wife of Christ means being cleansed   by him from the guilt of sin.         Verse 25-26: "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the   church and gave himself up for her; that He might sanctify her,   having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word."        If you have to be flattered in order to feel good, then the   marriage between Christ and his wife will not make you feel good.   It is a highly unflattering picture that he must bathe us in order   to marry us. We were unattractive not beautiful; we enemies not   friends; and we were dirty with the guilt and moral filth of sin   all over us and inside of us. And he chose us and died for us and   raised us to life and cleansed us. He took away our filth. He took   away our guilt. He bathed us and made us clean before an all-holy   God.        The water of baptism is a representation of that spiritual   washing. Notice that the cleansing from sin in verse 26 comes from   the self-sacrifice of Christ in verse 25. So it is with baptism.   It represents a dying with Christ as we are buried with him in   water and it represents a being cleansed by Christ through that   very death in water. So immersion in water provides a perfect   symbolic combination of dying with Christ and being cleansed by   Christ. And they must be combined because it is the death of   Christ is the power that cleanses. 1 John 1:7 says, "The blood of   Jesus cleanses us from all sin." Baptism represents a burial and a   bath; because the burial is the bath.        Let me bring this message to a close by giving you one of the   most graphic Biblical pictures of God's marriage to his people   Israel. It's found in Ezekiel 16, and I think God means for us to   see in it a picture of Christ's marriage to the church. It catches   up what we have seen so far and points us forward to the rest of   what it means to be the wife of Christ, that we will look at   tonight. Start at verse 3 and read through verse 9.         3 Your origin and your birth are from the land of      the Canaanite, your father was an Amorite and your mother a      Hittite. 4 As for your birth, on the day you were born your      navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for      cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt or even wrapped in      cloths. 5 No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these      things for you to have compassion on you. Rather you were      thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the      day you were born.                6 When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your      blood, I said to you while you were in your blood, "Live!" I      said to you while you were in your blood, "Live!"  (Notice      the sovereign work of God taking a repulsive cast-away and      giving her life.)               7 I made you numerous like plants of the field. Then you      grew up, became tall, and reached the age for fine ornaments;      your breasts were formed and your hair had grown. Yet you were      naked and bare. 8T hen I passed by you and saw you, and behold,      you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you      and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered      into a covenant with you so that you became Mine, declares the      Lord God. 9 Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood      from you, and anointed you with oil.          That is what it means to be the wife of Christ. Cast out,   bloody, dirty, as good as dead. And then the Son of God walks by.   Stops. Looks at this disgusting, filthy, aborted thing as good as   dead and covered with blood, and says, "At last! My wife. My   beloved. My chosen one. Live!" And he comes again when she is   grown and covers her nakedness and washes away her filth and makes   a marriage covenant with her . . . and then beautifies her and   prepares to present her to himself in glory.        That's what we will talk about tonight: the beautifying and the   presentation of the church to Christ in glory.        The church is the body of Christ because the church is the wife   of Christ. And being the wife of Christ means being loved by   Christ before we were attractive. It means being loved with   self-sacrificing love. It means he chose us, raised us, cleansed   us. All of you who are in Christ: he loves you as a man loves his   wife, differently, distinguishingly, unlike any other in the   world.        October 11, 1992 p.m.    2nd half of sermon on Ephesians 5:22-32    (and using Ezekiel 16:1-14)         What it means to be the wife of Christ.           4. It means being made progressively Holy   (Sanctification)           What is it?         a. be holy and blameless and without spot or wrinkle (v.27)    b. abstain from sin (1 Thes. 4:3)    c. go for good deeds (Titus 2:14), LOVE (1 Thes. 3:12)    d. progressive sanctification (1 Thes. 4:1; 2 Pet. 3:18; Heb.   10:14)         The Basis of it?         a. Christ's death (2 Cor. 5:15; 1 Pet. 2:24; Titus 2:14; Heb.   13:12    b. the blood of covenant (Luke 22:20) is a new covenant in my   blood (Heb. 8:6,10; Ezek. 36:25-27)         Necessity of it         see Heb. 12:14; 2 Thes. 2:13; Romans 6:22-23         Agent of it         a.

It means being presented finally to Christ,   perfected as his wife.           Does this show a deficient, needy, lonely Christ? No: All his   saving work is to fit us to reveal him and enjoy him as   all-sufficient. And in this he rejoices.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
