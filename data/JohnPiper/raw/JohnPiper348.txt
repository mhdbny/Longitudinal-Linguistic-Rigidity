 April 12, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        GOD'S INVINCIBLE PURPOSE:    FOUNDATIONS FOR FULL ASSURANCE    "God Sanctifies His People"    (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24)         May the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly;      and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and      blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who called      you is faithful, and he will do it.                 Introduction:         How can you have the assurance of salvation if holiness is   necessary?        Vast portions of the Christian church today in America seek   assurance by making holiness of life unnecessary. If holiness of   life is not necessary to get to heaven then an unholy person can   have assurance that he will get there. They don't just deny that   perfection is not required for entering heaven (which is true; we   do not attain practical perfection in this life); but they go   beyond that and say that no degree of obedience or holiness or   purity or goodness or love or repentance or transformation is   required for entering heaven. They say that if God required any   measure of practical obedience or holiness it would do three   terrible things: 1) nullify grace and 2) contradict justification   by faith alone and 3) destroy assurance.        But that is not true. The Bible teaches that none of those   things happen when the Biblical necessity for holy living is   rightly understood. There is a glorious assurance in the Christian   life! But it is not found by denying the demand for holiness.         1. The necessity of holy living does not nullify   grace.         It is based squarely on the pardon of grace. And it   demonstrates the power of grace. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said,   "By the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was   not in vain but I worked harder than any of them. Nevertheless it   was not I but the grace of God which is with me." Grace is not   only the pardon that passes over our badness; it is also the power   that produces our goodness. If God says that it's necessary for   grace to do that, it is not a nullifying of grace when we agree   with him.         2. The necessity of holy living does not contradict   justification by faith alone.         Three weeks ago I tried to show that all the sins of God's   people, past, present and future, are forgiven because of the   death of Christ once for all. I said that this justification on   the basis of Christ's death for us is the foundation of   sanctification--not the other way around. I put it like this: the   only sin we can fight against successfully is a forgiven sin.   Without a once-for-all justification through Christ, the only   thing that our striving for holiness produces is despair or   self-righteousness.        But I did not say that the work of God in justification makes   the work of God in sanctification optional. I didn't say (the   Bible doesn't say) that forgiveness makes holiness optional. It   doesn't make it optional, it makes it possible. What we will see   today is that the God who justifies also sanctifies. The faith   that justifies also satisfies--it satisfies the human heart and   frees it from the deceptive satisfactions of sin. Faith is the   expulsive power of a new affection (Thomas Chalmers). That is why   justification and the process of sanctification always go   together. They both come from the same faith. Perfection comes at   the end of life when we die or when Christ returns, but the   pursuit of holy living begins with the first mustard seed of   faith. That's the nature of saving faith. It finds satisfaction in   Christ and so is weaned away from the satisfactions of sin.         3. The necessity of holy living does not destroy   assurance.          The human mind might reason like this: if some measure of holy   living is required and if it cannot be precisely quantified--if   you can't tell me exactly how much is necessary--then that   requirement will always leave me unsure if I have enough. So any   requirement for holiness or obedience at all destroys   assurance.        But this is simply not the reasoning of the Bible. The Bible   shows abundantly that there is a "holiness without which we will   not see the Lord" and we are told in Hebrews 12:14 to "pursue" it.   But it does not imply that this destroys assurance. And the reason   it doesn't is what today's sermon is about. Namely, God's   commitment to sanctify us--to make us as holy as we need to be in   this life--is as sure as his election and his predestination and   his justification and his call. What gives us assurance in this   matter is not primarily focussing on the measure of our holiness,   but on the measure of God's faithfulness to do the sanctifying   work he promises to do. There's the key.         Exposition:         So let's look at this in our text. Notice three things: the   commandments, the prayer, and the promise.          1. The Commandments          Paul has just finished giving a string of commandments in   verses 14-22 which comes to an end in verse 22, "Abstain from   every form of evil." So we know that God uses commandments and   incentives in the way he sanctifies us. He does not say: "I am the   one who sanctifies you, so I have nothing to tell you to do." The   way he sanctifies is not merely subconscious. He deals with our   minds and our motives. That's the first thing to notice.          2. The Prayer          Then in verse 23 Paul shifts from exhorting or commanding us to   be holy to asking God to make us holy: "May the God of peace   himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body   be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus   Christ." So not only does God use commands and incentives in the   way he makes us holy, he also uses the prayers of his people. He   not only deals with your mind and motives in the way he makes you   holy; he deals with the minds and motives of others so that they   pray for you.          3. The Promise          Notice not only the commandments and the prayer, but most   important the promise of God. After commanding us to pursue holy   living in verses 14-22 and praying that God would sanctify us in   verse 23, Paul says the decisive thing in verse 24: "He who called   you is faithful, and he will do it."        This is the way Paul handles the assurance problem. Let it   shape your thinking this morning. It is mere human reasoning and   not God that says: "Well, he is commanding us to abstain from   evil, so it must be up to us to get holy, and therefore it's not   assured." It is mere human reasoning and not God that says: "Well,   he is praying for God to sanctify me, so it depends on Paul's   prayer and God may or may not answer, and so it is not assured."   All that is wrong thinking. It's not what the text says. Right   thinking moves on to verse 24 and says: God's faithfulness   combined with God's call proves he WILL do it! "He who calls you   is faithful, and he WILL do it." What's the IT? The "it" is what   Paul's been commanding and what he's been praying for, namely,   sanctification. God will do it.        That is the foundation for full assurance. Paul did not say   that you have to make holy living unnecessary to have assurance.   He said that God is faithful and he WILL do it. The issue of   assurance is: will we trust him not only for the grace to forgive   our sins, but also for the grace to make headway in overcoming our   sins. Will we believe what verse 24 says: "God is faithful, he   will do it."        Now if you are looking at verse 23 carefully you may have the   question I had: When Paul prays that God would sanctify us and   keep us blameless "at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ," does   he mean that God will change us then in the twinkling of an eye   when Jesus comes, or does he mean that he will work in us now so   that we will be holy when Jesus comes? Are verses 23 and 24 a   prayer and a promise for what God will do all at once only when   Jesus comes? Or are they a prayer and a promise for what God will   do now in the lives of believers to prepare them for that day in   holiness?        My answer is that it's a prayer and a promise for God to do   what needs to be done now. My reason for this is not only that   sanctification usually refers to the process of becoming holy now,   but also the parallel in chapter 3:12-13 shows that this is what   Paul means.         "May the Lord make you increase and abound in love      to one another and to all men, as we do to you; so that he may      establish your hearts unblamable in holiness  (that's what      Paul prays for in 5:23)  before God our Father at the coming      of our Lord Jesus Christ (same phrase as in 5:23) with all his      saints."         So what Paul is praying is that God would do something NOW,   namely, make us increase and abound in love. And the goal of this   progressive work in us NOW is that when the end comes we might be   established before God in holiness, because love is the essence of   human holiness.        So my conclusion is that 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 really does   teach that God is the one who sanctifies NOW. He does it through   commandments and incentives that appeal to our minds and our   motives. He does it through prayer. But however he does it, and   however slowly it comes, and however imperfect we feel, the main   thing is that GOD does it, and he WILL do it. That is the ground   of our assurance. "He who calls you is faithful. He will do it."   Assurance does not come from making holiness optional. It comes   from knowing God is faithful.        But why is it that the faithfulness of God commits him to   sanctify us. The key is the connection between the other parts of   our salvation and God's work of sanctification. You can see this   clearly in verse 24. Paul says, "He who calls you is faithful. He   will do it." It's as if Paul said, "He called you! Don't you see?   He called you! And if he called you then he WILL sanctify you.   That's what his faithfulness means. Don't you get it?"        And you scratch your head and say, "Why does the fact that he   called us mean that he has to sanctify us?" And Paul says, "It's   because his purpose in calling you was that you might become holy.   Holiness is the invincible purpose of God in your call. He would   be unfaithful to his purpose if he just called and didn't   sanctify. That's what I said back in 4:7, 'God has not called you   for uncleanness, but in holiness.' 'God called you with a holy   calling' (2 Tim. 1:9). His purpose in calling you is your   holiness. He will do it. He's faithful."        I hope you begin to feel what this means for the foundations of   your assurance. It means that every successive step of your   salvation is rooted in the certainty of all the steps that have   gone before. Your sanctification is rooted in your call and   guaranteed by your call. Your call is rooted in the death of   Christ for sinners. The death of Christ is rooted in   predestination and predestination is rooted in election. Once you   feel yourself caught up in this great, objective, God-wrought   salvation, you know yourself loved with an omnipotent,   everlasting, electing, predestining, atoning, calling,   sanctifying, saving love. And you sing, "God is faithful. He will   do it!"        But not only that, the aim of God in your election was your   holiness: Ephesians 1:4, "God chose us in him before the   foundation of the world that we might be holy and blameless before   him in love" (cf. 2 Thess. 2:13). Your holiness is as sure as your   election.        Not only that, the aim of God in your predestination was your   holiness: Romans 8:29, "Those whom he foreknew he predestined to   be conformed to the image of his Son." Becoming like Jesus is as   sure as God's purpose of predestination.        Not only that, the aim of God in the death of his Son was your   holiness. Ephesians 5:26, "Christ loved the church and gave   himself up for her that he might sanctify her--make her holy."   Your becoming holy is as sure as God's invincible purpose in the   death of his Son.        In choosing you his purpose was your holiness. In predestining   you his purpose was your holiness. In dying for you his purpose   was your holiness. In calling you his purpose was your holiness.   And so we can say with Paul in verse 24 not only, "He who called   you is faithful, he will do it--he will sanctify you," but also,   "He who chose you is faithful, he will do it. He who predestined   you is faithful, he will do it. He who sent his Son to die for you   is faithful, he will do it.        2 Thessalonians 2:13 says, "God chose you from the beginning to   be saved through sanctification"--not apart from sanctification.   Salvation comes through sanctification, and no other way (cf.   Romans 6:22). We have a great and glorious ground of assurance not   because holiness is superfluous, but because God is faithful. He   will do it.
