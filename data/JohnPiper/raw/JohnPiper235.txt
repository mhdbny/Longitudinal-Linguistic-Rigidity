 April 23, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        WATCH OUT FOR THE WOLVES WITHIN        (Acts 20:28-31)        
        Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy   Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God which   He obtained with the blood of His own Son. I know that after my   departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the   flock; and from among your own selves will arise men speaking   perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. Therefore   be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night   or day to admonish every one with tears.        One way to summarize the first part of Paul's message to the   Ephesian elders is this: he is emphasizing that he has done all he   can do for their salvation. He has lived a life of lowliness and   labor and tears and trials and utter dedication. And he has taught   them the whole counsel of God. He didn't shrink back from any   demand or any danger or any doctrine. He has done all he can do to   deliver them from the destruction of unbelief and disobedience and   lead them to everlasting life and joy.        But Paul knows well that in order to be saved in the end -- in   order to inherit the kingdom and enter life -- a believer has to   persevere. For example, in 1 Corinthians 15:1-2 Paul said, "I   preached to you the gospel, which you received, in which you   stand, by which you are saved, if you hold it fast -- unless you   believed in vain." Paul knew that there was such a thing as   believing in vain -- false starts in the Christian life.        That means very practically that once you've poured part of   your life into a ministry -- into a group of people -- you can't   ever walk away and glibly say, "Well, I've taught them all they   need to know. They accepted it. So they are now safe and secure.   On to a new work."        The reason you can't say that, is because God has ordained that   his people persevere to the end through the faithful ministry of   teaching, prayer, and care. And so when Paul is done with his   three-year investment in the church of Ephesus -- teaching,   praying, caring day and night with tears -- he does NOT say, "So   long, hope you make it." He makes sure that there are elders who   will stay behind and who will pick up where he left off and teach   and pray and care the way he did. Because if they don't, the   church will not survive. And many would-be saints will perish.   (See Revelation 2:5-7.)        So in this next section of his message to the elders of Ephesus   (verses 28-31) Paul tells them how utterly crucial their role is   in the survival and health of the church when he is gone. He gives   them a general command. Then he applies the command to themselves   and to the flock. Then he gives them four incentives to throw   themselves into this work with the same dedication he did.        As far as I can tell, virtually nothing has changed between the   day this was written and today that would change the teaching at   all for our own elders. So let's listen very carefully to what   this means for Bethlehem.        First, lets notice the general command.        Verse 28 starts, "Take heed . . ." Or: "Be on guard . . ." Then   verse 31 (at the end of this paragraph starts, "Therefore, be   alert . . ." Or: "Be on your guard . . ." So the paragraph begins   and ends with a call to vigilance. Elders must be alert, awake,   open-eyed, watchful.        This is Paul's way of saying that the church is always a   threatened church. Satan never takes vacations. Sin lurks at the   door waiting for the moment of doctrinal or moral carelessness.   The command for the elders, therefore, is: Stay awake. Be alert.   Watch.        But watch what? Paul applies our vigilance in two ways: Elders   must watch themselves; and the elders must watch the church.        Verse 28 starts, "Take heed to yourselves." Now that could mean   two things. It could mean, "Elders, take head of each other's   needs and weaknesses and faults." Or it could mean, "Elders, each   of you take heed to his own heart and doctrine and behavior."   Probably it means both.        It's not surprising that Paul says this first is it? He spent   half his message talking about his own life and work. The point   was: it matters what kind of person the elder is, not just what he   believes. So the first command to the elders is to watch over   themselves. Robert Murray McCheyne said, "What my people need most   from me is my personal holiness." I think Paul agrees. That's why   it comes first: "Elders, take heed to yourselves. Your first duty   to the church is to be a certain kind of person."        Then Paul applies the command for vigilance to the elders'   oversight of the flock. Verse 28 goes on, "Take heed to yourselves   and to all the flock." Notice three things here that are very   important for our life as a church.        First, the church is like a flock of sheep in need of   shepherds. Second, the elders are the shepherds. Third, it is the   duty of shepherds to care for the sheep. All of this is set out in   verse 28: "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock (so the   church is like a flock),in which the Holy Spirit has made you   overseers (so the elders are the overseers or shepherds of the   flock), to care for the church of God (so it is the duty of the   overseers or shepherds to care for, or tend, the sheep -- to see   that they have food, like Jesus said: "Feed my sheep," and to see   that they are protected from wolves, as we will see in a   moment).        If we had the time we could show from other passages (e.g. 1   Peter 5:1-3; Titus 1:5,7; and 1 Tim. 3:1; 5:17; Phil. 1:1; Acts   15:22; etc.) that this was not just the way things were organized   at Ephesus but in virtually all the New Testament churches.        If you ask, Where does the title "pastor" fit into this, the   answer is that the word "pastor" is based on a Latin word that   simply means shepherd. Pastors are the shepherds being spoken of   here. The New Testament does not distinguish between elders and   pastors and overseers -- they are all the same. The term "Elder"   highlights their maturity and respect in the church. The term   "Shepherd" or "Pastor" highlights the responsibility to the church   as a flock. And the term "Overseer" makes that same role even   clearer without using the image of sheep and shepherd. In summary   then, "elder," "pastor," "shepherd," and "overseer" (sometimes   translated "bishop," 1 Tim. 3:1) all refer to the same person in   the New Testament church. They aren't separate people or separate   rolls.        And in the New Testament, churches always had more than one   elder or pastor or overseer. A one-pastor church is unknown in the   New Testament. This is true whether the churches are small and new   or older and large. In Acts 14:23 as Paul and Barnabas returned   from their first missionary journey it says, "And when they had   appointed elders (plural) for them in every church, with prayer   and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they   believed."        I point this out because the duty of elders is to "take heed to   all the flock." Notice: ALL the flock. Not just the healthy sheep,   but also the sick. Not just the strong, but also the weak. Not   just the responsive, but also the unresponsive. Not just the   faithful, but also the wayward.        If you want to feel how overwhelming that is listen to Richard   Baxter, in his book on this text entitled The Reformed Pastor   (1656):        It is you see, all the flock, or every individual member of our   charge. To this end it is necessary, that we should know every   person that belongs to our charge; for how can we take heed to   them, if we do not know them? . . . Doth not a careful shepherd   look after every individual sheep? a good schoolmaster after every   individual &#91;student&#93;? a good physician after every   particular patient? . . . Paul taught his hearers not only   "publicly but from house to house": and in another place he tells   us, that he "warned every one, and taught every one, in all   wisdom, that he might present every one perfect in Christ Jesus."   Many other passages of Scripture make it evident that it is our   duty to take heed to every individual of our flock. (pp. 90f.)        What would he say of Bethlehem? And of my ministry? You can see   perhaps why a text like this, along with the struggle to think   through the future staffing configuration of the church has caused   a great deal of heart searching for Noel and me.        Of course, one answer in a church this size is to have enough   elders (that is, overseers or pastors) so that every single church   member is known by name and is fed and helped and disciplined   according to his or her own particular need.        Baxter says, rightly I think,        O happy Church of Christ, were the laborers . . . proportioned   in number to the number of the souls; so that the pastors were so   many, or the particular churches so small, that we might be able   to "take heed to all the flock." (p. 90)        So we have seen so far that Paul gives the elders a general   command to be alert and awake and on guard -- to be vigilant in   their spiritual life and ministry. Then he applies that general   command specifically to the elders themselves -- they should take   heed to themselves, their doctrine and their life -- and then to   the flock of God -- ALL the flock.        Now what Paul does is to give four incentives, or motivations   or encouragements to the elders to do their work with great   diligence and seriousness. It is not merely a job. It is not a   profession among other professions like lawyer, doctor, engineer,   etc. There is laid upon the elders of the church of Christ a   responsibility unique in all the world. And Paul really stresses   how high the stakes are in this work.        1. The first incentive for the elders is that the flock they   are to serve cost God the blood of his Son. Notice the end of   verse 28 "to care for the church of God which he obtained with the   blood of his own Son."        It's clear that Paul wants the elders to be shocked by this.   The argument is plain: if God almighty -- sinless and free and   high above all things -- was willing to shed the blood of his Son   for a sinful, messed up, unworthy church, then the shepherds must   be willing to pour out blood sweat and tears in season and out of   season for the flock of God.        Suppose I am a single dad with four sons. And you and your   spouse and my family are deep sea fishing off the Florida coast.   My youngest son gets too close to the edge, and when a wave tilts   the boat he loses his balance and falls into the water and   disappears beneath the surface. In a split second I dive in after   him. After about ten seconds of breathless suspense I burst out of   the water and I've got him. I hand him up over the side and just   as I am getting into the boat a shark cuts out of nowhere and hits   me from behind and takes away half my side. You pull me into the   boat and just before I bleed to death I look up into your face and   say, "Take care of the boy for me."        That's a pretty strong incentive. Jesus "loved the church and   gave himself for her&yuml;.&yuml;.&yuml;." (Ephesians 5:25). An   elder who is not willing to pour out blood, sweat, and tears for   the faith and holiness of the church of Christ does not know the   worth of the blood of the Son of God.        2. The second incentive Paul gives to the elders is that they   have been chosen for this work by God not themselves. Verse 28   says, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock in which the   Holy Spirit has made you overseers&yuml;.&yuml;.&yuml;." The Holy   Spirit chooses who should be the elders in the church.        It's hard to imagine incentives that are more gigantic, more   powerful, and more awesome in scope than these two. The sheep are   gathered by the blood of God's Son. And the shepherds are given by   the call of God's Spirit. How can they not pour themselves out   with every ounce of energy and life that they have for the faith   and holiness of the church!        3. The third incentive Paul gives to the elders is that great   danger always awaits the church. Verse 29-30, "I know that after   my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the   flock; and from among your own selves will arise men speaking   perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them."        The incentive for vigilance here is the danger that inside the   church men will aspire to the eldership who are wolves in sheep's   clothing (Matt. 7:15). They will slowly begin to speak twisted and   distorted things about Scripture. And unless the elders are   spiritually alert and thoroughly Biblical in their vigilance, the   wolves may decimate the flock.        Let me just mention one feature to watch out for in the   recognition of wolves. As I have watched the movement from   Biblical faithfulness to liberalism in persons and institutions   that I have known over the years this feature stands out: An   emotional disenchantment with faithfulness to what is old and   fixed, and an emotional preoccupation with what is new or   fashionable or relevant in the eyes of the world.        Lets try to say it another way: when this feature is prevalent,   you don't get the impression that a person really longs to bring   his mind and heart into conformity to fixed Biblical truth.   Instead you see the desire to picture Biblical truth as unfixed,   fluid, undefinable, distant, inaccessible and so open to the   trends of the day.        So what marks a possible wolf-in-the-making is not simply that   he rejects or accepts any particular Biblical truth, but that he   isn't deeply oriented on the Bible. He is more oriented on   experience. He isn't captured by the great old faith once for all   delivered to the saints. Instead he's enamored by what is new and   innovative.        A good elder can be creative. But the indispensable mark when   it comes to doctrinal fitness is faithfulness to what is fixed in   Scripture -- disciplined, humble submission to the particular   affirmations of the Bible -- carefully and reverently studied and   explained and cherished. When that spirit begins to go there's a   wolf-in-the-making.        So the third incentive for elders is the ever-present danger of   wolves in sheep's clothing who twist the truth and lead the people   away to destruction.        4. The last incentive for elders to be vigilant is Paul's   personal example. Verse 31: "Therefore, be alert, remembering that   for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone   with tears."        If the great apostle worked night and day; if he worked with   everyone; if he worked with tears; then how much more should   little peons like me and the other elders of Bethlehem pour out   our lives day and night with tears for this church!
