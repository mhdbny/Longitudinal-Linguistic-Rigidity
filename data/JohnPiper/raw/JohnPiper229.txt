 March 19, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    Palm Sunday    John Piper, Pastor            HIS DOMINION SHALL BE FROM SEA TO SEA    (Zechariah 9:9-10)        Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of   Jerusalem!    Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he,   humble and riding on an ass, on a colt the foal of an ass. I will   cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem;   and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to   the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the   River to the ends of the earth.            When Jesus entered Jerusalem publicly for the last time he did it   in a way that very consciously fulfilled the prophesy of Zechariah   9:9. He sends two of his disciples to get the young donkey to ride   on, and Matthew tells us very plainly in Matthew 21:4-5, "This   took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet." Then he   quotes part of Zechariah 9:9, "Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold,   your king is coming to you humble, and mounted on an ass, even on   a colt, the foal of an ass."       One other Gospel writer tells us that this was a fulfillment of   prophecy, namely, John. In John 12:15 he quotes part of Zechariah   9:9 and then explains to us honestly that the disciples did not   know what was going on at the time. He says, "His disciples did   not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then   they remembered that this had been written of him and had been   done to him. In other words, after the resurrection of Jesus and   his Ascension to the Father in heaven, a lot of things began to   fall into place about what Jesus had really meant by the things he   did and said.        It's like reading a good novel. In the early chapters you   wonder why this character was introduced and what that comment   means and why the person did this or that. But when the last   chapter unfolds everything falls into place. That's the way it was   for the apostles after the resurrection. Lights went on   everywhere. There must have been a hundred ah-ha experiences. "So   that's what he meant when he said&yuml;.&yuml;.&yuml;."        -- "Destroy this temple, and in three days I build it   again"!    -- "If a seed falls into the ground and dies it bears much   fruit."    -- "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of   the corner."    -- "A little while and you will see me no more; again a little   while and you will see me."    -- "If David calls him Lord, how is he is son?"                And not only did the words and actions of Jesus shine with new   meaning in the light of the resurrection of Jesus, so did the Old   Testament. John says this donkey act simply went over their heads.   But later the passage in Zechariah 9:9 flamed with personal   significance when they realized that they had witnessed its actual   fulfillment in the life of Jesus.        Now where are you in your understanding of the prophets? Are   you still scratching your head in a kind of before Easter darkness   or are you standing in the light with the apostles now that Jesus   is glorified to the Father's right hand. Well, the answer is, I   suspect, both. There are things puzzling and hard to catch onto in   the prophets -- partly because they have not happened yet and we   don't know the exact way that they will. But also partly because   we have not gone back and pondered the prophets from the   standpoint of what we now know about their fulfillment in   Jesus.        That's what I want to do this morning. Let's let Zechariah tell   us about the meaning of Palm Sunday by going back to his prophecy   and reading it in the light of its fulfillment in Jesus. I hope   that you will see before we are done that this is not irrelevant   to our situation today in 1989 America. When God inspired   Zechariah five hundred years before Christ to see his entry into   Jerusalem he also inspired him to see thousands of years beyond   that to another day of worldwide reign and worldwide peace. It is   very crucial we see how these two visions are related -- one in   verse 9 and one in verse 10. Palm Sunday has to do not just with   Zechariah's future, but with our future too.        First, let's look at Zechariah 9:9.        The verse begins with a command to rejoice! "Rejoice greatly, O   daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!" Zion is   another name for Jerusalem. So Zechariah is repeating himself for   emphasis. And "daughter of Zion" and "daughter of Jerusalem" mean   the people of Zion and Jerusalem. The offspring of this holy   city.        Of course you might say, "Well I am not part of the daughter of   Jerusalem, so this is not something for me to get excited about."   Are you sure? You know Paul said something very strange and   wonderful in Galatians 4 about Jerusalem being the mother of all   Christians. We don't have time to go into that. But don't rule   yourself out yet. This text is going to reach out and get you   included one way or the other before we are done with verse   10.        The point we need to get a hold of here is that God's final   goal -- God's plan for his people -- is joy. And he heightens the   expectation of that joy by saying its GREAT joy -- "Rejoice   greatly (exceedingly), O daughter of Zion!" And he heightens it   again by saying that the kind of joy he has in mind is a shouting   joy. "Shout aloud (or shout triumphantly)" -- it's a word used for   trumpet blasts and victory shouts.        I won't press this any further because "Irrevocable Joy" is the   theme of next Sunday's message. And because next Sunday evening is   the Festival of the Resurrection. But let me say a week in advance   that these two lines are one of the reasons we need periodic   festivals in our lives. Paul says, "Rejoice always." But we don't   always go around shouting; we could more than we do! But it helps   to have some special times made just for that kind of release.        "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!    Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!"                That is God's goal for us and our destiny beyond all the misery   and sin of this world.        Now the rest of the text is the basis of this joy. What will   God do to make the daughter of Jerusalem rejoice? Here is where   the prophecy begins.        The next line of verse 9 says,        "Lo, your king comes to you."        One very important point is obvious from these few words, "Lo,   your king comes to you." It's obvious that when he comes he will   make the daughter of Jerusalem happy. Or to put it another way he   is the kind of king who makes his people shout for joy.        He is not a Nero who fiddles while Rome burns. He is not a   Marcos who lives in lavish luxury while his land languishes in   poverty. He is not an Ayatollah that shames his citizens. He is   the kind of king that will make the daughter of Jerusalem, the   offspring of Zion leap for joy. Children will sing hosanna. Old   men will dream dreams. Slave girls will prophesy. The blind see.   The lame walk. The deaf hear. The lepers are cleansed. The poor   have good news preached to them. Zechariah commands the daughter   Zion to "shout for joy," because the king is coming. So he must be   the kind of king that makes people happy.        Now how does he do that? Why is it such good news that this   king is coming? Why isn't it frightening and fearful?        The next lines give the answer. The RSV says, "Lo, your king   comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he." Focus on these two   words for a moment. The NASB says, "He is just and endowed with   salvation." The NIV says, "Righteous and having salvation."        The first word is indeed "righteous" or "just". The reason the   RSV often translates this word with "triumphant" is because it is   so often used in the sense of "successfully standing up for what   is right." That implies victory for the oppressed and the   innocent. In other words God's righteousness does imply victory   because he is God. But I think we do best to keep the meaning   "righteous" or "just" so that we don't miss the intention that   God's victory's are accomplished in his righteousness.        So the first thing Zechariah says about this coming king is   that he is righteous. He will stand victoriously on the side of   right -- on the side of the innocent and the faithful -- the ones   who have waited in faith and patience like old Simeon and Anna --   the ones who have stood true to God's word. "Blessed are those who   are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom   of heaven." In other words, The righteous king coming from heaven   will bless those whom the world has cursed because they stood for   the righteousness of God. And so Jesus, just like Zechariah says,   "Rejoice in that day and be glad, for great is your reward in   heaven" (Matt. 5:12).        That's the first reason the coming of this king is good news.   That's the first way he makes people happy. He is righteous -- he   is not wicked. He stands up for those whom the world thought were   crazy in their commitment to love and lowliness and justice. The   tables will be turned, the righteous and the lowly will be   vindicated. And they will rejoice!        The second way he makes the daughter of Jerusalem happy is   found in this other word. The RSV translates it "victorious". The   NASB, "endowed with salvation". And the NIV, "having salvation".   The Hebrew word is literally "saved". This form of the word is   used two other times in the Old Testament: Psalm 33:16, "A king is   not saved by his great army." And Deuteronomy 33:29, "Who is like   you, O Israel, a people saved by the Lord?" But to call the coming   Messiah "saved" is so strange that most translators just can't   accept it. How would it inspire joy and worship for the king if he   were described as "saved". It doesn't sound strong and mighty.        What would your answer be? Mine is: that's the whole point of   verse 9. The king is not coming mainly as a strong warrior but as   a gentle peacemaker. He is strong. But he is not strong in the   sense of being bossy or hard or loud or fierce or cruel. That's   the point of the next two lines.        "Humble, and riding on an ass,    on a colt the foal of an ass.                He is humble not arrogant or pushy. The word is often used for   afflicted as well as meek. And if he is afflicted and meek, it may   not be so strange that he would need to be rescued or saved from   some affliction or danger or attack.        And riding on a donkey -- what does that mean? Well coming   right after the word "humble" it surely reinforces the idea of   being lowly and meek. He isn't mainly interested in a big show   that exploits the people for his own ego.        But the ass was not as despised then as it is now. In the Old   Testament kings and kings' sons did ride now and then on asses.   But they did not ride on asses when they were going into war. Then   they rode on war horses. The ass was an animal for peace time --   for work time -- not for war. What the donkey stands for then is   that this king is coming not only as a humble man, but as a   peacemaker.        In Luke 19:41, right after the entry into Jerusalem on the   donkey it says, "And when he drew near and saw the city he wept   over it, saying, Would that even today you knew the things that   make for peace!" That shows, I think, that his choice of a donkey   to enter the city was like coming in under a white flag -- not of   surrender, but of desire to make peace.        And if that weren't enough, just a few verses earlier in Luke   19:38 Luke tells us that the people were shouting, "Blessed is the   King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory   in the highest!" I think Luke wants to make plain in the way he   tells the story that Jesus was coming on the donkey mainly as a   peacemaker. And not just peace on earth between man and man, but   also peace in heaven between God and man. "Peace in Heaven!" they   cried. Let God in heaven be at peace with his people!        So what Jesus meant when he chose that donkey to ride on was   this: I am meek and lowly in heart; I am approachable; you can   find rest for your souls here; I am not against you, I am for you;   I did not come to condemn but to save; I come on behalf of God, my   Father in heaven, to reconcile you to him -- to make peace between   you and your Maker.        Now how did Jesus make peace between sinful people and a holy   God? Colossians 1:20 says that he made peace "by the blood of his   cross." Jesus died to make peace between God and sinners. Looking   back from this side of Good Friday and Easter we can see all that   in the words, "Lo, your king comes to you; righteous . . . humble   and riding on an ass." He is righteous, which means he can be our   righteous substitute and fulfill all that we have failed to do. He   is humble or afflicted, which means he is willing to be rejected   and despised and beat up and killed for others. And he is riding   on an ass, which means that he wants to make peace not war, and   that this is why he gives himself up to death.        But now what about the word "saved" in the line that says, "Lo,   your king comes to you; righteous and saved"? I said that   translators reject it because the context seems to demand   something more powerful, more regal. So they say, "Having   salvation," or "victorious". But is it true that the context   demands something powerful and regal? I suggest that the context   points to the possibility that this humble king bearing tidings of   peace on a simple donkey may indeed be treated in such a way that   he needs to be saved -- not from his own sin, but from ours. He   will need to be saved from our scoffing and our smiting and our   murder. How do you get saved after you've been murdered?        Peter gives the answer in a sermon preached seven weeks after   the death and resurrection of Jesus. He says to a crowd in   Jerusalem, "You killed Jesus by the hand of lawless men. But God   raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death because it was not   possible for him to be held by it." In other words, God saved   Jesus from the grave. He loosed the pangs of death. So Jesus was   saved. (See Psalm 16:10=Acts 2:27; Isaiah 53:12)        No it does not sound powerful and regal in Zechariah 9:9 when   the coming king is described as righteous and saved. But it is not   supposed to. It's supposed to sound humble and peaceable. What the   humility of Jesus means is that he was willing to be so afflicted   and so abused and so defeated that he needed saving.        And because God saved him from death and raised him up alive   forever, he can now save anybody. He comes to you this morning as   a peacemaker. He has laid down his life so that he might make you   a genuine offer of reconciliation. He doesn't want there to be a   barrier between you and him. He doesn't want hostility or   indifference to stand in the way. He has come farther toward you   in his humility than you could ever go toward him. And there is   still time in your life to hear Jesus say, "O that they knew the   terms of peace."        Yet you may say again, am I included here? Is this not some   strange 2500 year old Jewish prophecy that really has no relevance   to my modern life at all? To give one last answer to that we look   very briefly at verse 10 to get one point from all the things we   might talk about. It says,        I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim    and the war horse from Jerusalem;    and the battle bow shall be cut off,    and he shall command peace to the nations;    and his dominion shall be from sea to sea,    and from the River to the ends of the earth.                Here is the one point for you personally this morning: this   king, who came in humility to Jerusalem about 1959 years ago   riding on a donkey of peace, now reigns in heaven and commands   peace to all the nations. That means America and that means you.   His reign begins humbly in Jerusalem, but then it spreads to all   Judea and then to Samaria and then to the ends of the earth.        There is no people or tribe or tongue or nation excluded from   his command to make peace with God through Jesus Christ. And   therefore I can with great confidence and even the authority of   God's word say to everyone of you gentiles this morning far away   from Jerusalem, He is reaching out to you with peace this morning.   He loves peace and hates war. He loves peace and hates hostility.   He loves to bring near and hates it when there is distance and   enmity and bitterness and unbelief separating you from God.        I give you one last incentive to make peace with him this   morning. It says, "His dominion shall be from sea to sea." This   humble, righteous, killed and saved and peacemaking king will one   day, and perhaps very soon, come back to the earth as ruler over   all the nations. There will be a judgment and only those who   received the terms of peace will enter his kingdom.        In the mean time king Jesus has all authority in heaven and on   earth and commands all men everywhere to repent and believe in   him. You are very clearly included in this word from God this   morning and it is utterly important that you settle things with   God today.
