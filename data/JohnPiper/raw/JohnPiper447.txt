    August 27, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     COMING TO YOURSELF AND COMING TO THEFATHER   (Luke 15:11-24)           And He said, A certain man had twosons; and the younger of    them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of theestate that falls to me.' And    he divided his wealth between them. And not many dayslater, the younger son    gathered everything together and went on a journey into adistant country, and there he    squandered his estate with loose living. Now when he hadspent everything, a severe    famine occurred in that country, and he began to be in need.And he went and    attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, and hesent him into his fields    to feed swine. And he was longing to fill his stomach withthe pods that the swine    were eating, and no one was giving  anything  tohim. But when he    came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired menhave more than enough    bread, but I am dying here with hunger! 'I will get up and go tomy father, and will say    to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in yoursight; I am no longer    worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.' And he got    up and came to his father. But while he was still a long wayoff, his father saw him, and    felt compassion  for him , and ran and embracedhim, and kissed him.    And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned againstheaven and in your sight; I    am no longer worthy to be called your son.' But the fathersaid to his slaves,    'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put aring on his hand and sandals    on his feet; and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let useat and be merry; for this    son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost,and has been found. 'And    they began to be merry.              Introduction: Eagerly Awaiting     All of Luke 15 is spoken as an answer tothe accusation of the  Pharisees and the scribes in verse 2 that Jesus receivessinners and eats with  them. Verse 1 says that all the tax-gatherers andsinners were coming near to  him to listen to him. And Jesus was making a place for themat his table and  encouraging them to stay and eat with him.     Luke uses this word receive( prosdechomai ) six other  times in his writings and every time it means eagerly awaitor expect and look  for. In Luke 2:25 Simeon was eagerly awaitingthe consolation of Israel.  In Luke 2:38 Anna the prophetess spoke to those in the temple whowere eagerly  awaiting the redemption of Israel. In Luke 12:36 Jesus says,Be like men who are  eagerly awaiting the return of the master from thewedding feast. And so on.  In other words, Luke 15:2 says that Jesus is not just receivingsinners; it is looking for  them and eagerly awaiting their coming. He has his eye out forthem. The word  receive sounds passive. But Jesus is not passive. Heis seeking sinners and  tax-gatherers to come to him and eat with him.     So the Pharisees and Scribes accuse him. Andall the rest of the  chapter is Jesus&#146; explanation to them of what is reallyhappening when he welcomes  sinners and eats with them.    The first answer in verses 3-7 is that hisreceiving sinners is like a  shepherd who finds a lost sheep and celebrates with all hisfriends.    The second answer in verses 8-10 is that hisreceiving sinners is like  a woman who finds a lost coin and celebrates with all herfriends.    And in both answers Jesus leaves no doubt aboutwhat he means, because  in verses 7 and 10 he tells the Pharisees that the lost sheep andthe lost coin represent  lost sinners, and the being found represents repentance, and thecelebration is what God  and all the angels are doing in heaven.    And at that moment some get it and somedon&#146;t. He is saying: I  welcome sinners because I am the incarnation of God&#146;s lovepursuing the lost. I am  the shepherd seeking the sheep. I am the woman seeking her coin.And this meal that we are  eating together is a little bit of what is happening in heavenright now, and a foretaste  of the joy that is coming. When sinners turn from their sin andaccept my fellowship as  the joy of their lives, they have come home to God. And God isglad.     Luke 15: Lost and Found     Now in verses 11-24 Jesus gives a thirdanswer to the  Pharisees&#146; accusation. When he receives sinners and eats withthem, it is like a  father who finds a lost son and celebrates with all his house. Allthree parables have  this in common: being lost and being found followed by great joyin heaven.                Verse 6: Rejoice with me for I have found  my sheep which      was  lost !        Verse 9: Rejoice with me for I have found  the coin which I      had  lost !        Verse 24: &#145;This son of mine wasdead, and has come to life      again; he was  lost , and has been  found .&#146;And they began to be      merry.            A lost and found sheep -- and a party. A lostand found coin -- and a  party. A lost and found son -- and a party.    Pause here for a minute with me and ask: whydid Luke record this? And  why should I preach on it? What&#146;s the point in 1995?     The day before yesterday Cook County officialsburied 68 bodies in  Homewood Memorial Gardens just outside Chicago. Who were they?People who have nobody that  knows or cares. They just die. Someone finds them on the street orin a park or in an  alley or in a lonely tenement. The officials search for relatives.The Medical  Examiner&#146;s Office waits and holds the bodies. No one comesforward to claim the body.  A hundred-eighty-foot long trench is dug at the cemetery and thewooden boxes are lined up  next to each other and buried. No stone. And no marker. Thishappens every month with 20  to 30 unclaimed people in Chicago.    When I read that, what hit me was the lostnessof so many people in our  society. Lost from virtually everybody. Surrounded by millions inChicago and not a single  person seems to know or care when they die. This feels likeabsolute lostness.     But it&#146;s not. Absolute lostness is whenyou are cut off from God.  It is better to die unknown by every human in Chicago than to dieunknown by God. If we  feel a fearful sense of alienation because of 68 forgotten peopleburied in a mass grave  in Homewood, Illinois, how much more should we feel the fearfulprospect of dying without  God.    Luke 15 is about the love of God coming intothe cities and suburbs of  our world to find lost sons and daughters. It&#146;s about theidentity of Jesus Christ  and the meaning of his mission in the world -- then and now.It&#146;s about a story of  destitution at our front door yesterday morning and Noel&#146;staking a woman to her  landlord and paying some rent and praying with her -- and knowingwe were probably ripped  off. And believing: this is the heart of God.    If you ask me, is the point of preaching onthese parables that you  want us to be like Jesus -- to receives sinners and eat with them -- to find lost sheep  and coins and sons and bring them home to the Father? I would say,My first aim is that  you would see Jesus. Jesus did not end these parables withGo and do likewise.  And Luke did not end this chapter with: Go and imitateJesus. The first point  is: look at him. Look at him. Consider Jesus. Know Jesus. Learnwhat kind of Person it is  you say you trust and love and worship. Soak in the shadow ofJesus. Saturate your soul  with the ways of Jesus. Watch him. Listen to him. Stand in awe ofhim. Let him overwhelm  you with the way he is.    That&#146;s my first aim. If I could succeed atthat, we would be so  permeated with the beauty of this risky, painful, sacrificial,loving way of life, we  could not but pursue it.     The Lost Son     What&#146;s different about the parable ofthe lost son is that the  misery of his lostness is spelled out, the nature of hisrepentance is spelled out, and  the lavish enthusiasm of the Father is spelled out more fully thanin the other two  parables. Let&#146;s look briefly at each of these.    Running away from God starts by feeling freeand ends in utter misery  -- either in this life or the one to come, or both. Look at thisin verses 13:          And not many days later, the younger songathered everything    together and went on a journey into a distant country, and therehe squandered his estate    with loose living.         The word loose (asõtõs) means awild, abandoned,  reckless manner. This always feels free for a season -- likeskydiving feels free --  until you realize you don&#146;t have a parachute. So running fromGod at first feels  free.     But then verse 14:           Now when he had spent everything, asevere famine occurred in that    country, and he began to be in need.         Easy come easy go. And then reality. A famine.Where do you think that  came from? What might be the design in that?    Verse 15:           And he went and attached himself to oneof the citizens of that    country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.        When we break our attachment with God, you willend up attached to  another, and that attachment will be slavery not sonship. It maybe drugs or alcohol or  illicit sex or an employer or a spouse or a sport or a hobby or atelevision or a lake  cabin or a computer (with Windows 95!) or books. The attachmentmay be crude or it may be  refined. If we break loose from God, we will be attached toanother. And in the end  (whether crude or refined) this alien attachment will send us tothe swine troughs --  either in this life or the one to come.    Verse 16:           And he was longing to fill his stomachwith the pods that the swine    were eating, and no one was giving  anything  tohim.        You and I were made to be filled with God. Andif we run from him, if  we take our little earthly inheritance of time and money andenergy and use it to attach  ourselves to other things than God, it won&#146;t matter whetherwe are worth nine billion  dollars or buried in Homewood, Illinois -- our future will beswine food for all eternity.    That&#146;s the misery Jesus describes when werun from the  Father&#146;s house.    Then he describes the nature of the son&#146;srepentance. Verse 17:           But when he came to his senses(literally: came to himself), he    said, How many of my father's hired men have more thanenough bread, but I am dying    here with hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and willsay to him, &#145;Father, I    have sinned against heaven, and in your sight; 19 I am no longerworthy to be called your    son; make me as one of your hired men.&#146;        Notice three elements in this repentance.     First, he comes  to himself  (v.17). Whenyou are alienated from  God you are always alienated from yourself. You can&#146;t knowyourself or relate  properly to yourself if you are running from the one who made yourself for himself. You  were made by God in the image of God for God. These are the threemain things about your  identity as a human being; you are made by God, like God, for God.Therefore conversion is  coming to yourself as well as coming to God. It isdiscovering where you came  from and who you are and why you exist. Running from God is alwaysa running from  ourselves. Repentance is waking up to this truth.    The second part of repentance is humblebrokenness and a deep sense of  unworthiness before God. Verse 18:           I have sinned against heaven, and in yoursight; I am no longer    worthy to be called your son.        Lostness is not something we can make excusesfor. We are guilty. We  are rebels (Isaiah 53:6). We have known our Father&#146;s will,and have rejected it. So  repentance is a deep sense of how horribly offensive this is toGod, and that we have no  rights before him at all.     The third part of repentance is that we castourselves on God&#146;s  free, merciful, bountiful provision of grace. Verse 17:           How many of my father's hired men havemore than enough bread, but    I am dying here with hunger! I will get up and go to myfather.        Now notice something very carefully here. Atthis point many people  make a terrible mistake in the way they try to come home to God.The lost son is willing  to come home as a servant rather than a son. Does that mean hewants to relate to God as a  hired hand who earns things from God and thus turns a generousfather into an wage-paying  employer? I don&#146;t think so. Is that what God wants? What theson is saying is: look  at how rich and generous my father is. Even the servants eat well.You might say: even the  crumbs that fall from the father&#146;s table would satisfy memore than what the world  has to offer. The focus here is not on the service that he cansupply to the father, which  the father then would be obliged to compensate. The focus is onthe incredible bounty and  generosity that he has so foolishly traded for the fleetingpleasures of sin. Repentance  is believing that God is so great an so good that the smallestenjoyments of his house are  better than ten thousand worlds without him.    With that changed heart, the boy heads home.     Which brings us to the third focus of thisparable. First, there was  the misery of lostness; second, there was the nature ofrepentance; now third, there is  the lavish enthusiasm of the father when the boy comes home.     What will you find when you turn home to Godthrough Jesus Christ? What  did you find? Are you enjoying what you found? Here&#146;s whatyou will find. See it in  six photographs of God&#146;s welcoming his son.          Verse 20: The son got up and came tohis father. But while he was    still a long way off, his father saw him. God is not sobusy with other things that    he is not concerned about his alienated children. All hisaffairs are in order, and well    taken care of. He is free to be concerned about his children.Before anyone else sees, God    sees. He sees every twitch of your soul.      Verse 20: When he saw him far off, hefelt compassion for    him. There is something in Almighty God like this. Some ofyou fathers know what it    is like to have a child run away from home. Then there&#146;sthe phone call, and a    rendezvous, and the flood of emotion and longing and love whenyou see him walking toward    you. That&#146;s the way it is with God when you head home.      Verse 20: And he ran. Now here isa middle aged man, the    owner of significant estate, with servants at his beck and call.There is a certain    decorum to maintain. There is a dignity. Such people do not run.Unless they have thrown    all middle-aged decorum to the wind and given themselves over tothe utter joy of their    hearts. That&#146;s the way God is about your coming home.      Verse 20: And he embraced him andkissed him. I could    probably bring tears to hundreds of eyes in this room if Ilingered over this and    encouraged you imagine that one person in your life that youwant to come home -- home    from sin, home from alienation, home from unbelief, home fromhard-heartedness -- and what    it would be like to see brokenness in their face and to reachout and embrace them and    kiss them. You need to know that God is this way. God is pureand God is physical. He does    not hold you at arms length. Jesus did not have to include thesevivid, emotion-laden    details. He wants you to feel something here about the way Godwelcomes you home.      The son makes his confession. Then in verse22, The father said    to his slaves, &#145;Quickly bring out the best robe and put iton him, and put a ring on    his hand and sandals on his feet.&#146; Here is the lavishwelcome of the father.    The  best  robe. The robe of sonship, not slavery. The robeof full, lavish,    enthusiastic, unrestrained restoration to the family. That isthe way the Father is when    you come home.      Finally, the celebration. Verse 23:Bring the fattened calf, kill    it, and let us eat and be merry. God is very glad when youcome home. When Jesus    receives tax-gatherers and sinners and eats with them, it is thegladness of the Father    gathering in his lost children.       Martin Luther once said, If I couldbelieve that God was not  angry with me, I would stand on my head for joy (H. Oberman,p. 315).     The gospel is almost too good to be true. Butwhat do you hear when the  Father says (v.24),          This son of mine was dead, and has cometo life again; he was lost,    and has been found.
