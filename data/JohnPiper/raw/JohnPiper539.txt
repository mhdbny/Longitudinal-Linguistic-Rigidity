 November 15, 1998    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        DOING AND ENDORSING EVIL    (Romans 1:28-32)        And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer,   God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which   are not proper, 29 being filled with all unrighteousness,   wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit,   malice; they are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent,   arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31   without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; 32 and   although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice   such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but   also give hearty approval to those who practice them.       Committing Spiritual Suicide and Taking Others Along        In one sense, verse 32 brings chapter one to an end with a very   bleak view of human nature. The point of the last half of the   verse is to show that many people not only do things that they   know deserve death, but also entice others to do them and approve   when they do. "Although they know the ordinance of God, that those   who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the   same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them."   In other words, the end-point of depravity is not just the   suicidal love affair with sin, but the desire to bring others with   you to destruction. It's not just that people choose death for   themselves in the passion of sin, but that they become Dr.   Kevorkians at the spiritual level, and assist others in eternal   self-destruction by approving their sin.        You can think of lots of ways this is happening today. I'll   give you one illustration. Jesus said, "You have heard that it was   said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY'; but I say to you that   everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already   committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye makes   you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better   for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole   body to be thrown into hell" (Matthew 5:27-29). In other words, we   can know that giving up the fight for purity and giving in to a   life of lust will, in the end, destroy our souls (see 1 Peter   2:11).        So for a person to live in lust is spiritually and eternally   suicidal. It deserves the sentence of eternal death, Jesus says.   What are we to make of it then, that in our day not only do   millions of people live this way, but tens of thousands of people   assist them to live this way and devote all their energies to   providing the means by which millions sign their own eternal death   warrant. Last year (Feb. 10, 1997) U.S. News and World Report   carried an article by Eric Schlosser who reported that pornography   has become so commercially successful that it has at least one   trade publication called Adult Video News. The News claims that   the number of X-rated video rentals rose from 75 million in 1985   to 665 million in 1996. In that year, $8 billion was spent on   pornographic material in America. Schlosser said that if you add   up all that our country spends on Broadway productions, and   regional and nonprofit theaters, and include the total revenues   for opera, ballet, jazz, and classical music performances, you   have less than the revenues for strip clubs alone (pp. 43-44).        So, in view of what Jesus says about the eternal peril of   living in lust, what this amounts to is not only millions of   people committing spiritual suicide, but also tens of thousands of   people making their living luring others to destruction and   helping them drink the poison that will kill them. This is what   Paul says is the bottom of the spiral into depravity - not just   doing what deserves death, but heartily approving others who do it   and even helping them along in their self-destruction.        But I began by saying that in one sense verse 32 brings chapter   one to an end with a very bleak view of human nature. We not only   sin and choose death; we approve sin and recruit for sin and fail   to be outraged at sin, and we create a climate for sin to   flourish, and so we take others with us to death. But there is   another sense in which this verse is, in my view, full of hope for   those of us who love the truth and love to see people find it and   believe it and be saved by trusting Jesus who is the Truth. So   what I want to do is make three observations about what this verse   teaches, and then, on the basis of these, show you one of the   hopeful implications of the verse.        Everyone Knows God and Some of His Moral Demands        1. The first observation is that verse 32 takes us back to   verses 18-19 and teaches us that everyone not only knows God, but   also knows some of the moral demands of God and what disobedience   deserves.        Look back at verses 18-19: "For the wrath of God is revealed   from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who   suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because that which is known   about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to   them." We saw from these verses that there is in all human beings   a knowledge of God. Verse 18 says we are guilty for suppressing it   and that the wrath of God is being revealed on us because we do.   But the knowledge is there.        Now in verse 32 we learn that this knowledge of God includes a   knowledge of his moral law: "They know the ordinance of God, that   those who practice such things are worthy of death." Paul is   speaking here of people in general who do not have access to the   Bible or any special revelation. This is an astonishing   affirmation about human nature. Everybody has knowledge of God and   the moral law of God, whether they have seen a Bible or not, or   whether they live in America or in an undiscovered people group of   Irian Jaya.        People are Without Excuse before God        2. The second observation is that this knowledge means people   are without excuse before God not only because of the way they   treat God, but also because of the way they treat each other.        We saw in verses 20b-21 that people are without excuse,   because, even though they know God, they don't honor him or give   him thanks: "They are without excuse. For even though they knew   God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks." Having   knowledge of what you should do takes away excuses for not doing   it. Now we see that this same principle applies not only to how   people treat God, but how they treat each other. Verse 32:   "Although they know the ordinance of God (= verse 21b), that those   who practice such things are worthy of death (= they are without   excuse, verse 20b), they not only do the same (= verse 21b), but   also give hearty approval to those who practice them." You see the   parallel. In verses 20-21 they are without excuse because they   know God, but don't treat him the way they should. And in verse 32   they are without excuse because they know God's moral law, but   don't treat people the way they should.        And there is another important point to make about this   accountability. We are morally responsible for our sins (that is,   without excuse) even though our sinning may be worse because we   have been handed over by God to the power of a depraved mind.   Recall verse 28: "God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do   those things which are not proper." The point of verse 32 is to   say that "practicing such things" (the very things that God handed   us over to) deserve death even though we have been handed over by   God to do them. In other words, God's judgment on sin - that it   becomes worse and worse - does not lessen the guilt of the sinner.   On the contrary, verse 32 says, "we know" that the very things we   do when God hands us over to our own depravity are "worthy of   death."        There is a Real Knowing that Is Deeper than Consciousness        3. The third observation from verse 32 is that there is a real   knowing of moral things that is deeper than consciousness.        I say this because there are, no doubt, many people who would   say that they don't believe in moral standards set by God,   especially if they say they don't believe in God. But verse 32   says, "They know the ordinance of God, that those who practice   such things are worthy of death." Note the phrase, "ordinance of   God." Paul teaches us that, even if people don't think they know   ordinances of God, they, in fact, do know at least one, namely,   that doing the things listed in verses 29-31 deserves death. This   must mean then that there is a knowledge deeper than   consciousness.        We saw this in verse 18: "The wrath of God is revealed from   heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who   suppress the truth in unrighteousness." There is a "holding down"   of the truth about God and about his law. This can be done with   such immediacy and with such natural disapproval that we don't   even see it happening. We know that certain things are against   God's law, but we don't experience the knowing as conscious.        Now, on the basis of these three observations, consider the   implications for our sharing the gospel with unbelievers. Consider   what this means for apologetics - giving reasons for your faith -   and for missions to, say, Muslim people or Jewish people.        What verse 32, together with verses 18-21, teaches us is that   every person we know, and every person we will ever talk to,   already knows God, deep down, and knows God's law. That is an   astonishing truth for everyone who wants to communicate the   gospel. Think on it specifically for a moment.        Verses 18-21 teach that everyone knows God, in the sense that   everyone knows that God exists and that he is "eternal" and   "powerful" and "glorious" and "beneficent." At least that much,   Paul says, is made known in nature and is buried somewhere in the   subconscious of every person - in some deep, and in some just   beneath the surface. We may suppress it, but we know it. It is   there, and it has effects on our lives.        Then verse 32 adds that everyone knows not only that God exists   and is eternal and powerful and glorious and beneficent, but also   that God has a "righteous ordinance," that the sins of verses   29-31 deserve the punishment of death. Everyone, Paul says, knows   this. Charles Hodge puts it like this: "The most reprobate sinner   carries about with him a knowledge of his just exposure to the   wrath of God" (Romans, Edinburgh: The Banner of Truth Trust, 1972,   p. 45).        What Does this Mean for Evangelism?        Not that everyone you talk to will necessarily admit that he or   she knows this. But you come to them with the tremendous   (Biblical) confidence that you are not starting from scratch in   establishing the truth in their soul. They are not blank tablets.   They may have buried it, distorted it, hidden it, drugged it, run   from it by overwork or excessive play and entertainment; but you   know it is there.        What do you do? You don't assume they don't need to hear that   truth. You don't say, "Well, the truth of God and his moral law is   in their heart, so I will not tell them about God's glory and   power and his righteous demands." Rather, you speak the truth with   the confidence that this reality you are describing is not utterly   foreign to them. You speak with the confidence that what you are   saying can ring true with something deep inside of them.        To the Person Who Says, "I'm not Sure there Is a God"        What if they say, "How do I know that what you are saying is   true? How do I know there is a God, and that he is glorious and   beneficent? What about Hurricane Mitch and Honduras? Maybe God   should be cursed instead of thanked. Maybe he deserves death for   breaking my law instead of me deserving death for breaking his   law"?        Now there are a lot of possible answers to this kind of   question. 1) One would be to take them to Luke 13:1-5 and say,   "Those who die in natural catastrophes are not necessarily worse   sinners than the rest of us. Unless we repent we will all perish."   2) Or you could take them to the book of Job and show them how   Satan is involved in some natural catastrophes, but that God   maintains ultimate control and brings all the events of the world   to serve his good and overarching purposes. 3) Or you could take   them straight to the cross of Christ and show them that, whatever   misery we must suffer here, God shared our misery in order to save   us from the final judgment on our sin and bring us to everlasting   joy.        But Romans 1:32 suggests another possible answer. You might   say, "I know you doubt the reality of God and his glory and his   goodness and his moral law and your guilt for disobedience. I know   that. But the Bible teaches that you really do know these things   already deep in your heart. Which means that if you would humble   yourself and ask God to free you from the blinding effects of sin,   these things could take on a self-evidencing authority for you.   You wouldn't be dependent on me or anybody else. You would know   the truth because God has revealed it to you in nature and has   written it on your heart."        Then you could say, "In fact, if you're willing, what I would   like to do is tell you God's remedy for this guilt. When you see   that there is indeed a God who is great and glorious and good, and   when you see that he has a moral law that we have broken and that   we all deserve death, know this: God sent his Son Jesus Christ   into the world to save sinners. He lived a perfect life. He died   to take our place, so that everyone who trusts him will be   forgiven and will be counted righteous before God for Jesus' sake.   My prayer for you is that God will uncover the knowledge that he   has already put in your heart in such away that you will see the   perfect fit between the gospel of Christ and your need."        O ponder these things for yourselves and for the people you   want to reach with the saving gospel of Jesus. Ponder them in   relation to Jewish people, for example, and Muslim people. Romans   1:32 says that every one of them knows that he has broken the   ordinances of God, and that he deserves death. But neither Judaism   nor Islam has a satisfying way to deal with this kind of guilt and   get right with God. Therefore, if God would be pleased, in answer   to our prayers, this innate knowledge could make them ready for   the gospel - the good news that because of Jesus' death for our   sin, God declares righteous everyone who simply trusts in him.        If you're not a Christian this morning, be encouraged to open   your eyes to the truth that God says is already in you, and then   let the gospel of Christ crucified be the perfect remedy for what   you see.        And if you are a Christian this morning, let Romans 1:32 make   you more bold with unbelievers, and more confident that God has   gone before you to do a great work of preparation. The gospel of   Jesus Christ is the perfect and the only remedy for what people   already deeply and profoundly know about themselves. Speak it with   love and pray that God would give them the grace to suppress the   truth no longer.
