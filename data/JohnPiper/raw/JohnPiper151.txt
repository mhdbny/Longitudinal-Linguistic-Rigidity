  June 22, 1986MorningBethlehem Baptist ChurchJohn Piper, PastorCopyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   OUR HOPE: THE GLORY OF GOD  Romans 5:1-5 Therefore, since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God throughour Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have obtained access to this gracein which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God.More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering producesendurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured intoour hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us. We begin this morning by trying to sum up where we have come in this 17-partseries on Christian Hope. We began eleven weeks ago by asking, What is hope?And we answered from Hebrews 6:11 that it is not a finger-crossing wish like,"I hope daddy gets home in time for supper tonight." But instead it is a"fullassurance of hope." It is a confident expectation of good things to come. Then we asked, Why hope? Is there any ground or reason to hope? And we gavetwo answers. From 2 Thessalonians 2:16 we answered with the word grace: "TheLord Jesus Christ loved us and gave us good hope through grace!" We may hopebecause God is a God of grace. And the second answer came from Colossians1:23, namely, gospel: "Don't shift from the hope of the gospel." There ishope because of grace that overflows for the ungodly and because of goodnews that Christ died for sinners. Then we asked, How can I, a sinner who has no love to God and no inclinationto trust Christ, ever have hope? Salvation is promised to those who believe.How can I hope if I don't believe? And the answer we gave from 1 Peter 1:3was new birth: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ whoby his great mercy caused us to be born again to a living hope." The Spiritblows where it wills and quickens the heart, giving spiritual life so thatfaith is born and a living hope springs forth from what was once dry ground. Then we asked, How is hope sustained once it is created? The answer fromRomans 15:4 was, the promises of God: "Whatever was written in former dayswas written for our instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragementof the scriptures we might have hope." Our hope is sustained by what Godhas said in his word. Then we asked, What is the content of our hope? What is it that we are actuallyhoping for? We have given three answers so far and today will give a fourthand next week the fifth. We answered from Titus 2:13 that our blessed hopeis "the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ."We answered from Romans 8:23 that our hope is "the redemption of our bodies."And we answered from Galatians 5:5 that our hope is the consummation of ourrighteousness. We live in hope. We wait to see our Lord face to face. We wait to have wholeand healthy bodies which don't get sick any more. And we wait to have wholeand healthy souls which don't sin any more. Along the way we have taken time on Mother's day to speak of holy women whohoped in God (from 1 Peter 3:5) and on Christian Education Sunday to speakon educating for hope (from Psalm 78:7) and on Father's Day to speak on fatherswho give hope (from Colossians 3:21). The assumption behind these messages is that hope is an essential part ofsaving faith and that it is the spring of joy and love and courage and endurancein the Christian life. My goal very simply is to persuade unbelievers andto motivate believers to put your hope in the grace of God and not in yourselfor in anything this world can offer. This morning we look again at the content of our hope, this time, at theglory of God. Our text is Romans 5:1-2, "Therefore, since we are justifiedby faith, we have (or: let us have) peace with God through our Lord JesusChrist, through whom also we have obtained access to this grace in whichwe stand, and we rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God (or moreliterally: we rejoice in hope of the glory of God). Let's focus our attention on the last several words of verse 2, "We rejoicein the hope of the glory of God." In the time we have I would like to tryto unfold three wonderful truths in these words.         First, the glory of God is very great.       Second, the glory of God is a sure hope in Jesus Christ.       Third, the hope of the glory of God fills the heart with joy and exultation.   First -- and here is where we will spend most of our time -- the glory ofGod is very great. I get this point simply from two things in the text: oneis that the mere hope for it, not to mention the having it, fills the believerwith exultation. The other is that it is GOD'S glory, and God is very great! The catechism question for this week in the STAR is, "What is God?" And theanswer is: "God is a Spirit. He is infinite, eternal and unchanging, in hisbeing, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth." In other wordsGod is very great. And therefore his glory is very great. And if we are notfilled this morning with joy at the prospect of seeing and sharing that glorythen we need to pray right now that God would open the eyes of our heartand awaken our affection and give us a relish for his glory. God has been very good to us in the NT by giving us many different ways ofseeing the greatness of his glory. I am going to mention eleven of thesein the hope that one or several will sink into your heart and give you alonging for for God's glory. I am not going to define it first, but justlet the texts point you to the reality. 1. God shows that his glory is very great by saying that it is eternal. Romans11:36, "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him beglory for ever. Amen." The greatness of God's glory is seen in the fact thatit will never end. It is great in durability and permanence. 2. God shows the greatness of his glory by contrasting it with the frailand temporary glory of the world. 1 Peter 1:24, "All flesh is like grassand all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flowerfalls, but the word of the Lord abides for ever." "Flesh" in that verse simply refers to all that is not spiritual. All theaccomplishments of natural man are like grass and all their glory -- engineeringglory, architectural glory, artistic glory, electrical glory, atomic glory,computerized glory -- all our greatest human glory is like a dandelion ballcompared to God's permanent glory. C.S. Lewis preached a great sermon on June 8, 1941 called "The Weight ofGlory". He said, "Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations -- these are mortal,and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat." And if the greatest gloriesof the world are to us as the life of a gnat, how much greater must be theGod of glory in whom we live and move and have our being. 3. God shows the greatness of his glory by speaking of its might and power.Colossians 1:11, "May you be strengthened with all power, according to themight of his glory." And 2 Thessalonians 1:9 turns it around and speaks of"the glory of his might." The point is not very different: the glory of Godshines forth in great power, and the power of God exhibits itself in greatglory. If you want to conceive of the glory of God in its proper proportions, dwellon the scope of God's power. How great is the power of God when Isaiah 40says "He measured the seas in the hollow of his hands... and weighed themountains in scales"; and when Daniel 4 says, "He does according to his willin the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none canstay his hand, or say to him, What doest Thou?" and when Hebrews 1:3 says"He upholds the universe by his word of power." God is exceedingly powerfulbeyond all imagination, and his power is only one expression of his glory.Therefore his glory is very great. 4. He makes the greatness of his glory known by telling us that it was byhis glory that he did the greatest acts of power and love in history. Romans6:4, "We were buried with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ wasraised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newnessof life." Jesus Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.If the resurrection is a great thing, if the eternal hope of millions hangon this great deed, then the glory of the Father must be very great. Forit was the glory of the Father that burst the bonds of death and broughtlife and immortality to light. 5. God presses the greatness of his glory on our minds by referring againand again to the wealth or riches of his glory. Romans 9:22-23, "What ifGod, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has enduredwith much patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction, in order tomake known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy, which he hasprepared beforehand for glory." God compares his glory to wealth and saysthat the ultimate purpose of all history is to make the greatness of thatwealth known to the vessels of mercy prepared for glory. 6. God highlights the greatness of his glory by telling us that the joy ofexperiencing it will so far outweigh the sufferings of this life that theyare not worth comparing. Romans 8:18, "I consider that the sufferings ofthis present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealedto us." No matter how much you suffer in this life, the joy of the gloryof God will be so great as to make you feel as though your years and decadesof suffering were as nothing. 7. God says this to us in 2 Corinthians 4:17 and adds that the glory we willexperience is a "weight of glory." "For this slight momentary afflictionis preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison." Notice,the glory is eternal and weighty; the affliction by comparison is momentaryand light. Is there any heaviness in your life? Do you carry any burdens that are heavyand seem to drag on and on? The Lord teaches us that the glory of God isgoing to be so heavy that when it is put in the scales of your life for yourenjoyment it will make all the heaviness of this world go up like air inthe balances. 8. God causes us to see that his glory is very great by telling us that thegreat punishment in the day of judgment will be exclusion from his glory.2 Thessalonians 1:9, At the coming of Christ unbelievers "will suffer thepunishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of theLord and from the glory of his might." When my mother died back in 1974 and a few months later my father sold thehouse in which I grew up, I had a chance to go through it one last time.It was a deeply moving experience as walked from room to room rememberingher and knowing that I would never come home again. But O how much greater is the tragedy and the grief going to be for the personwho comes to the end of his days and has to say a farewell forever to theglory of God. Your heart was made to enjoy the glory of God. God is yourreal home. His glory is very great! And without it you will forever be heartsick.Don't live a life that results in being excluded from the presence of theLord and from the glory of his might. 9. The Lord pictures the greatness of his glory for us by showing us thatin the coming age the glory of God will replace the sun for our light. Revelation21:23, "And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for theglory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb." For now the immensityand brightness of the sun are reminders and symbols of the greatness andbrightness of the glory of God. But someday we won't need any symbols orreminders, for the real thing will swallow us up in light. 10. The Lord magnifies the greatness of his glory by revealing it to us inawesome settings of heavenly worship where it is held in proper esteem.Revelation 5:11-14, Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures andthe elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousandsof thousands, saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory andblessing!" And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under theearth and in the sea, and all therein, saying, "To him who sits upon thethrone and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might for everand ever!" And the four living creatures said, "Amen!" and the elders felldown and worshiped. Surely the purpose of giving us a glimpse into this heavenly worship is tomake us feel the greatness of the Lord and the tremendous worth of his glory. 11. Finally, we are made to see the greatness of the glory of God when Hebrews1:3 tells us that our Lord Jesus "reflects the glory of God and bears thevery stamp of his nature." The glory of God is not merely a distant and strangething. If we have seen Jesus we have seen the Father! We know what the moralcharacter of this glory will be. It will be like Jesus -- full of grace andtruth. So when Paul says in Romans 5:2 that "we rejoice in the hope of the gloryof God" he means for us to know and feel that the glory of God is exceedinglygreat. If there is any wonder, if there is any awe, if there is any admiration,or fame or praise or applause, it belongs to the glory of God. For all otherglory is like grass compared to God's. That is the first and major point: the glory of God is very great. Second, the glory of God is a sure hope in Jesus Christ. Romans 5:2 says, "We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God." The gloryof God is not yet manifest in full even though the heavens declare the gloryof God and Jesus himself is the image and reflection of that glory. Thereis so much more coming that we now live in hope. We wait. We wait for Christ.We wait for health. We wait for righteousness. And we wait for the gloryof God. But there are three phrases in Romans 5:1-2 that are intended to give Christiansstrong confidence and full assurance that we will indeed share in this glory.We don't wait and wonder if it will turn out well. We can wait and know thatthe glory of God is our eternal portion. The first phrase is, JUSTIFIED BY FAITH. ("Since we are justified by faith...")The second phrase is, PEACE WITH GOD. And the third phrase is THE GRACE INWHICH WE STAND. Suppose this text is fulfilled in you and you go whistling to work tomorrowbecause the hope of the glory of God has dawned in your heart. And supposesomebody says, "What are you so happy about?" and you say, "Because I knowI am going to share in the glory of God," and they say, "How do you knowthat?" What should you answer? Well, Paul tells you should answer in these three phrases. You say, "I knowI am going to share in the glory of God because I am justified by faith,and because I live at peace with God, and because I stand in the center ofGod's grace." And if they say, "And just how did you get access into the center of God'sgrace?" you will answer with verse 2, "Through Jesus Christ who loved meand gave himself for me. Because of Jesus, God acquitted me of all my sinsand reckoned me righteous in his sight. Because of Jesus God is now reconciledto me; we are no longer enemies but friends. And because of Jesus I haveaccess into his grace where I am as safe and secure as a babe in its mother'sarms." And then you will say, as I say to every one of you right now, "My friend,don't you want to share in the glory of God? You can if you turn from sinand start trusting Christ. He gives justification. He gives peace with God.He gives grace upon grace. And therefore our hope in the glory of God isnot built on sand. It is as sure as the character of Jesus Christ. Those are our first two points: 1) the glory of God is very great, and 2)the glory of God is a sure hope in Jesus Christ. That brings us to the third and final point -- which is not so much a pointin my message as it an opportunity for you to respond. It's simply this:the hope of the glory of God fills the heart with joy and exultation. "Werejoice, we exult in the hope of the glory of God." The reason we can always rejoice in God is not because the Christian lifeis an easy life. It isn't. The reason is that the glory of God is great beyondall imagining, and in Jesus Christ it is rock sure. And so REJOICE! Rejoice in glorious hope! Our Lord the judge shall come And take His servants up To their eternal home. Lift up your heart, lift up your voice! Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
