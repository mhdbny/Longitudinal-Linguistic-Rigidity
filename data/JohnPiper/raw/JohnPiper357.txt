 September 20, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       His Body: The Fullness of Him Who Fills All in All    Series on the Church #1    (Ephesians 1:15-23)         For this reason I too, having heard of the faith      in the Lord Jesus which exists among you, and your love for all      the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, while making      mention of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus      Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom      and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. I pray that the eyes      of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is      the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of      His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing      greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in      accordance with the working of the strength of His might which      He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead,      and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far      above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every      name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one      to come. And He put all things in subjection under His feet,      and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is      His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.                One link between the series on suffering, which we just   finished, and the series on the church as the body of Christ,   which we begin today, is that the suffering which Christ began to   experience in his earthly body he continues to experience in some   sense in his body called the church. You recall how before Paul   was converted he persecuted the church. Acts 9:1 says he was   breathing out threats and murders against the disciples of the   Lord. On his way to Damascus to capture and imprison Christians "a   light from heaven flashed about him." Acts 9:4 says, "He fell to   the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why do   you persecute me?'"        Now Saul did not believe that Jesus was alive. He thought the   whole thing was a delusion. He was persecuting deluded Jewish   fanatics that thought a dead criminal was the Son of God. But that   was not the way the Son of God saw it. When the Son of God spoke,   he said, "Why do you persecute me?" So not only is this crucified   criminal alive, but he is so identified with his followers that to   persecute them is to persecute him.        This is the link between suffering and the body of Christ. When   Christ was on the earth Christ had one kind of body, a physical   body like ours. And with it he suffered and died that we might   live. Now he is raised from the dead and sits at the right hand of   God; but on the earth he has another kind of body, namely, the   church. Christ was united to his body then, and felt the blows of   his enemies. And he is united to his body now, the church, and he   feels the blows of his enemies still.        You can see this connection between Christ and his people in   numerous texts. For example, in Matthew 25 Jesus says to his   people at the final judgment, "I was hungry and you gave me food,   I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you   welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you   visited me . . ." (vv. 35-36). And they ask, when this happened,   since Jesus wasn't there; he was in heaven. And he answers, "Truly   I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my   brethren, you did it to me" (v. 40). The brethren of Jesus are the   church. If you persecute the church, you persecute Jesus, and if   you show love and affection to the church you show love and   affection to Jesus. The church is his body, it is the physical   form of his presence on earth. Touch the church and you touch the   body of Christ, which means you touch Christ.        Another striking illustration of this is 1 Corinthians 6:15-16,   where Paul says, "Do you not know that your bodies are members of   Christ? Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them   members of a prostitute? Do you not know that he who joins himself   to a prostitute becomes one body with her?" If you are a disciple   of Christ, then you are a member (i.e. part) of the body of   Christ, and the parts of your body are parts of Christ's body--so   much so, Paul says, that if you commit fornication or adultery,   you drag Christ himself into bed with you and make him do what you   do.        I'm going to devote a whole message to that text in November.   But I just want to illustrate now the reality of Christ's presence   in the world in the form of his church, his body. Today on the   earth Christ has a body, the church. It has legs to walk and arms   to work and mouths to talk and feet to be blistered and backs to   be beaten, and hunger to be fed and loneliness to be visited. Paul   said that his aim in life was that the life of Jesus might be   manifested in his mortal flesh (2 Cor. 4:11). In other words, his   aim is that his body might make Christ's body real to the world.   Jesus said, "Whoever receives you receives me" (Mat. 10:40).        We are going to spend about 12 weeks talking about this amazing   reality--the body of Christ: Christ is present in the world in his   body, the church. And our aim is not just to fill our minds with   knowledge, but to fill Minneapolis with Christ. To become what   Christ wants to be in his body not only for each other but for   this city and for the unreached peoples of the world.        Now take that goal of "filling Minneapolis with Christ" and you   will see the connection with today's text, Ephesians 1:22-23, "And   he (God) put all things in subjection under his (Christ's) feet,   and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his   body, the fullness of him who fills all in all." Notice: "the   fullness of him who fills all in all." So this text speaks to the   issue of filling Minneapolis, or any other city, or the whole   world and the whole universe with Christ.        Let's make three careful observations from verse 23:        (1) First, the church is the body of Christ. Verse 22 ends by   saying, "God gave Christ as head over all things to the church."   Then verse 23 refers to the "church" when it says, "Which is his   body." The church is Christ's body. Not the building called the   church. (In the NT the word "church" never refers to a building.)   But the people of God, the disciples of Jesus, the elect from all   the nations--they are the body of Christ. That's the first   observation: the church is Christ's body.        (2) Second, Christ fills all in all. Verse 23: "Which is his   body, the fullness of him (i.e. Christ) who fills all in all." So   Christ fills all in all. Or as the present tense and the middle   voice imply: Christ is now filling for himself all in all.        I take this to mean that Christ is filling every sphere of   existence everywhere in the universe in all the ways he pleases.   The best guide for what this means that "Christ fills all in all"   is found here in the immediate context of verses 20-22 and in   4:8-10. Look at that text first. Paul is talking about the way   Christ rose from the dead and ascended into heaven; and in doing   so he broke the bonds of death and captured for himself a host of   captives, and led them free from sin and death and fear. Then Paul   says Jesus did this that he might fill all things.         8) "Therefore it says, 'When he ascended on high,      he led captive a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men.'      9) Now this expression, 'He ascended,' what does it mean except      that he also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?      10) He who descended is himself also he who ascended far above      all the heavens, that he might fill all things.         What this shows us is that Christ's purpose to fill all things   is accomplished by his rising from the dead and his ascending into   heaven as victor over his enemies. In other words "filling all   things" is something Jesus does with the authority he has as the   risen ruler over all things.        That takes us back to 1:20-22. Here Paul is doing the same   thing as in 4:8-10, namely, describing the resurrection of Christ   and his exaltation above everything and his triumph over   everything. Let's pick it up in verse 20b:         20b) &#91;God&#93; raised him from the dead, and      seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21) far      above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every      name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one      to come. 22) And he put all things in subjection under his      feet, and gave him as head over all things to the church.         Notice the four things God does for his Son in these   verses:    (1) he raises him from the dead (v. 20);    (2) he gives him the seat of kingly authority at his right hand   (v. 20);    (3) he puts everything in the universe in subjection to him (v.   22), which includes every form of evil power and every being which   is now or will be in the future (v. 21); and then    (4) he gives his Son with all that universal power and authority   to the church as the head of his body.        Now Ephesians 4:10 says all that happened "that he might fill   all things," just like verse 23 says this Christ is "filling all   in all." So the filing all things is the effect of Christ's ruling   all things. And the most natural meaning of the filling then would   be that he fills all things with the assertion of his rule and   authority. That is, asserts himself and his rights as fully as he   pleases in all things.        Picture him as the king over many territories that are not   fully subdued to him. This text is declaring that Christ is indeed   the king of the universe. He is "above ALL rule." (v. 21). He is   over "EVERY name" (v. 21). God put "ALL THINGS" under his feet (v.   22). He is head over "ALL THINGS" (v. 22). And by this authority   he will sovereignly fill all his territories with absolute sway.   He will accomplish his purpose in every sphere. He will make   himself unmistakably known in every place. He will be preeminent   in every nook and cranny of the universe. Even the outer darkness   of hell will be filled with his authority and his power and his   wrath and the knowledge of his wisdom.        So the first observation in verse 23 is that the church is the   body of Christ; and the second observation is that Christ fills   all in all. The glory of Christ will pervade "all in all;" that   is, the glory of Christ will pervade everything in every way that   the wisdom of God ordains for his maximum renown and splendor.   There will be no place where his power does not hold sway to   accomplish exactly what he wants for the dissemination of his   all-filling glory.        (3) The third observation, in verse 23, boggles the mind even   further, namely, Christ's body is his fullness which fills all in   all. "&#91;The church&#93; is his body, the fullness of him who   fills all in all." His body, the fullness. His body, the church,   is the fullness of Christ. Which most naturally means, the church,   the body of Christ, is the fullness by which Christ fills all   things.        Now how does that fit together with what we have said before?   We have said that Christ fills all things by asserting his   authority over all things to make himself known in all things--to   fill all things with his power and his wisdom and his glory. We   are saying that this fullness with which Christ fills all things   is the body of Christ, the church. What does that mean?        Look at Ephesians 3:10 for a clue. Paul says that he has been   called to preach the riches of Christ and reveal the mystery of   Christ, "in order that the manifold wisdom of God might now be   made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in   the heavenly places."        Now look at what is going on here. It takes your breath away if   you believe it and you are part of the church. The first thing is   that the wisdom of God--the manifold, many sided wisdom of God--is   being made known to the rulers and authorities. These are Satanic,   demonic powers in the universe. They are the very ones that   according to 1:21 state that Christ now is seated above with his   feet on them.        What is going on here is &#91;first&#93; that God means to fill   the habitations of demons with the manifestation of his wisdom,   the wisdom that conceived and ordained and planned and brought   about and will consummate the salvation of his people--the   unfathomable riches of Christ. Not even the place of demons will   be left without a revelation of the glory of Christ, the wisdom of   God.        &#91;The other thing&#93; going on here in 3:10 is that this   revelation that fills the habitation of demons happens "through   the church"--"that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made   known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the   heavenly places." I think this is an illustration of our third   observation from 1:23, namely, that the church, the body of   Christ, is the fullness of him who fills all in all.        It means: God AIMS to fill the universe with the glory of his   Son, Jesus, by making the church the showcase of his perfections.   Or, to put it another way, and include the idea of body: God means   to fill the universe with the glory of his Son by putting the   church on display as the embodiment of his Son.        Christ fills the universe with his glory by showing the   universe his body--how he chose her, how he destined her, how he   came for her and taught her and suffered for her and died for her   and rose for her and reigns for her, how he called her and   justified her and cleansed her and kept her and will raise her and   glorify her and satisfy her for ever and ever with himself.        There is so much more to say about this text and our   unspeakably great calling and destiny as the body of Christ. And I   will apply more of this text to us Wednesday evening. But let's   close with this final observation from verse 22. "&#91;God&#93;   put all things in subjection under &#91;Christ's&#93; feet"--so   that as sovereign ruler of all he might assert his truth and right   and power and wisdom in all the universe and fill all things with   his kingly glory.        Yes, all of that, but not without the church. The verse goes   on: "&#91;God&#93; put all things in subjection under his feet,   AND GAVE HIM AS HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH." God did not   exalt Jesus and subject all things to him and then simply say,   "Now go ahead and fill the universe with your glory; fill all   things with yourself." Instead he raised him and exalted him and   subjected all things under him and then made him one with the   church, as head to the body, and said, "Now, my Son, you and those   with whom you are united as head to body, go forth in the universe   and fill it with all that you are in your body. Let everything,   from the highest heaven to the lowest hell, be filled with a   revelation of your glorious perfections in the form of a chosen,   destined, blood-bought, called, justified, holy, glorified, and   infinitely, everlastingly satisfied people, your body, the church   of the living God. Amen"         Discussion questions for small groups         "His Body: The Fullness of Him Who Fills All in All" (Ephesians   1:15-23)        You might want to begin the discussion by asking what one truth   from the sermon had the most impact on some of the members of the   group. Remember the goal is to strengthen each other's hope in   God. Constantly draw the focus onto what builds more faith with   its joy and peace and courage to love.        1. We just finished a series of messages on suffering. How does   the suffering that Paul was bringing on the church lead us to see   the church as the body of Christ? See Acts 9:4. Even though this   verse implies we suffer as Christians, why is it encouraging?        2. If Acts 9:4 says that when we are persecuted Christ is   persecuted, then Matthew 25:35-40 seems to say that when we are   loved and cared for Christ is loved and cared for. Do you agree   with pastor John that "the least of these my brethren" in v. 40   refers to Christians? Compare Matthew 10:42. How might this union   between Jesus and his people motivate our practical acts of   ministry to each other, or the Christians in Somalia? Does it help   overcome the sense that little acts like visiting are somehow   insignificant?        3. How does 1 Corinthians 6:15-16 show that our participation   in the body of Christ is not just a general corporate thing, but   also a specific physical thing that includes our bodies? What are   some other behaviors (besides sexual immorality) where this truth   will affect the use of your body (eyes, ears, stomach, voice box,   etc.)?        4. In three brief sentences what were the three observations   pastor John made from Ephesians 1:23? (1: The church is the body   of Christ. 2: Christ fills all in all. 3: Christ's body is the   fulness by which he fills all in all.)        5. What is it about Christ that is stressed in Ephesians   1:20-22 which prepares us for the way Christ fills all in all? How   is this confirmed in Ephesians 4:10? How does it help to picture   Christ as a king with many territories who do not yet honor him as   king. What does he intend to fill them with so that they submit to   him as sovereign Lord? In view of what we see in our own modern   culture, what effect does this truth have on our daily lives?        6. The most astonishing observation from Ephesians 1:23 is that   the body of Christ, the church, is the fulness by which Christ   fills all things! Be sure to see the very words where that   observation comes from. Now if Christ is using his absolute   authority (described in verses 20-22) to fill all the universe   with his glory, how can it be said that it is the church that is   this fulness with which he is filling all things? Use the clue in   Ephesians 3:10 ("through the church").        7. What is the emotional effect on you in knowing that God   intends to make the church the showcase of his perfections in the   whole universe, including the demonic world itself (3:10)?         Suggestions for prayer focus:          (1) that God would hasten the day when this great work of   filling all things with Christ will be done ("Thy kingdom   come!");        (2) that we would have the eyes of our hearts enlightened to   see and feel the awesome calling and destiny that is ours as the   body of Christ;        (3) that we would conform more and more to the image of Christ   that our families and businesses and schools and city may be   filled with Christ here and now.
