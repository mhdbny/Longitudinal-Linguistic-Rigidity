 December 20, 1998    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        THE SON OF GOD APPEARED    TO DESTROY THE WORK OF THE DEVIL    (1 John 3:4-10)        Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin   is lawlessness. 5 You know that He appeared in order to take away   sins; and in Him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in Him sins;   no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. 7 Little children, make   sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is   righteous, just as He is righteous; 8 the one who practices sin is   of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son   of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the   devil. 9 No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed   abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 By   this the children of God and the children of the devil are   obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God,   nor the one who does not love his brother.        This Passage Will Help Our Understanding of Romans 2:6-10        I chose this text this morning for two reasons. One is because   it is the Sunday before Christmas when we are thinking about the   coming of Christ into the world, and verse 8 is one of the   clearest statements in the Bible about why Christ came. Verse 8b:   "The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of   the devil." We will come back to see what that means.        The second reason I chose this text is that, in our series on   Romans, we have been wrestling with the teaching in Romans 2:6-10   that eternal life is given to those who persevere in a life of   good works or a life of love. I have tried to show that this does   not contradict justification by faith alone, because our good   deeds confirm faith, but don't replace faith as the means of our   justification. This passage in 1 John, and indeed the whole book   of 1 John, sheds light on this issue.        So let's begin by seeing what's helpful in this book in regard   to the issue of Romans 2:6-10. Here's what's helpful. 1 John seems   to be one of the most perfectionistic books in the New Testament   and one of the least perfectionistic books in the New Testament.   It has verses in it that sound like Christians simply don't sin.   As if we are perfect. But it also has some of the verses that say   most clearly that everybody, including Christians, does sin.        So if we can understand why this is, it will help us grasp   Paul's point in Romans 2:6ff that you have to persevere in a life   of love in order to have eternal life, but this does not mean that   you have to be perfect.        Christians Are Perfect?        Let me show you these two sides of 1 John. First, let's look at   a group of verses that seem to say Christians are perfect and   don't sin. Maybe you would want to put "NS" in the margin beside   these verses for "not sin".        1 John 2:3 - "By this we know that we have come to know Him, if   we keep His commandments." Keeping the commandments is one means   of our assurance.        1 John 3:6 - "No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins   has seen Him or knows Him." And again in 3:9 - "No one who is born   of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he   cannot sin, because he is born of God." Same thing again in 5:18 -   "We know that no one who is born of God sins."        1 John 4:8 - "The one who does not love does not know God, for   God is love." Loving others is the evidence that you know God. If   you don't love people, you don't know God.        These verses show you what I mean when I say that 1 John seems   to be one of the most perfectionistic books in the New Testament.   We will come back in a minute to see what this means.        Christians Are Not Perfect?        But look at the other side. I said that 1 John also seems to be   one of the least perfectionistic books in the New Testament. It   has some of the clearest statements that everyone sins, including   Christians. Let's take a look at these. You might want to put "S"   in the margin for "sin". Then you can show someone who is   stumbling over the perfectionistic verses that there is another   side to the issue.        1 John 1:8-10 - "If we say that we have no sin, we are   deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our   sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to   cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not   sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us." This is   written to Christians. The "we" of verse 9 is believers. We must   confess our sins, because we do sin.        1 John 2:1 - "My little children, I am writing these things to   you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an   Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." Here is the   heartening realism: "If anyone does sin, we have an advocate." The   aim is that we not sin, but the reality is that we do sin.        1 John 3:2 - "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has   not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears,   we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is." We   are already God's children because of immense and incomprehensible   love, but we are not yet like him the way we will be when he   comes. There is yet a purifying work to do.        1 John 5:16-17 - "If anyone sees his brother committing a   &#91;omit "a" - the Greek text does not require it&#93; sin not   leading to death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to   those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a &#91;omit   "a"&#93; sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make   request for this. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a   &#91;omit "a"&#93; sin not leading to death." This last verse   seems to be targeted pointedly at perfectionists who say: all   sinning is equally damning and the only person who can escape   judgment is the one who commits no sin. John emphatically says in   verse 17b, "There is a &#91;omit "a"&#93; sin not leading to   death."            What Does John Mean by "Sin"        Now let's go to our text and look at it against this bigger   backdrop. When 1 John 3:6 says, "No one who abides in him sins; no   one who sins has either seen him or known him," and when verse 9   says, "No one who is born of God practices sin," the key is to   realize that the present tense verbs used here in Greek for "sins"   (verse 6) and "practices" (verse 9) imply ongoing, continuous   action. This probably means that, in John's mind, what is   impossible for the Christian is a life of unchanged continuation   in sin the same as when he was not born of God. In view of all his   insistence that Christians do sin, we can't take these verses to   mean Christians don't sin at all. We should take them to mean that   Christians don't go on sinning without conflict and confession.   Christians see it, hate it, confess it and fight it. And they do   so with increasing vigilance as they grow up into Christ.        That is what Romans 2:7 is trying to say: "To those who by   perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and   immortality, &#91;God will give&#93; eternal life." The point is   not that doing good earns eternal life or gets us connected to the   life of God in Christ. The point is that a changed life shows you   are already connected to God as his child. 1 John 3:9 says that   the reason born-again people don't go on casually sinning is that   "no one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides   in him; and he cannot sin." In other words, God has come into   their lives, caused them to be born again, put his "seed" - or his   Spirit - in them, and is working in them to awaken them to the   ugliness and folly and danger of sin so that they will be unable   to choose it.        They don't avoid sin first, in order to get God into their   lives. God gets into their lives first, and then they start   overcoming sin. You can see this clearly in 3:14, "We know that we   have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren."   Passing out of death into life happens first, and then we know   that it has happened because of its effect in our lives. We start   to love people like we never did before. You don't love people in   order to get out of death into life by new birth. You experience   new birth, pass out of death into life and the effect is love.        What Can I Do to Make New Birth Happen?        So if you ask, Well, what can I do, then, to make the new birth   happen?, the answer is that you can't do anything to make the new   birth happen, any more than an unborn baby can do anything to get   born. We can't believe the new birth into happening, we can't love   the new birth into happening, because the new birth has to happen   first so that we can believe and so that we can love.        The truth is that we are dead in trespasses and sins and cannot   make ourselves alive, any more than Lazarus could raise himself   from the dead. God must make us alive, as Paul said in Ephesians   2:5, so that we can believe. Look at 1 John 5:1, "Whoever believes   that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." Not "will be born of   God," but "is born of God," or more literally, "has been born of   God." The new birth precedes and enables faith. Faith is the   evidence of new birth, not the cause.        If you want to know what to do this morning to be right with   God, the answer is "believe that Jesus is the Christ." Put your   trust in Jesus as the fulfillment of all God's promises and bank   on those promises as your only hope. When you believe in Christ,   you know that you are born of him. Therefore, believe this   morning. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved"   (Acts 6:31). You will find God working in your life to save you   and you will rejoice and give him the glory.        The Christmas Message        But now go back to the text with me for a moment to get the   Christmas message. When verse 8b says, "The Son of God appeared   &#91;deity - clothed with humanity and born of virgin -who walked   in obedience, laid down his life and rose from the dead&#93; for   this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil," what are the   "works of the devil" that he has in mind? The answer is clear from   the context.        First, verse 5 is a clear parallel: "You know that He appeared   in order to take away sins." The phrase "he appeared to . . ."   occurs in verse 5 and verse 8b. So probably the "works of the   devil" that Jesus came to destroy are sins. The first part of   verse 8 makes this virtually certain: "The one who practices sin   is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning." The   issue in this context is sinning, not sickness or broken cars or   messed up schedules. Jesus came into the world to help us stop   sinning.        Before I draw out three practical implications of this, let me   put it alongside the truth of 1 John 2:1: "My little children, I   am writing these things to you so that you may not sin." In other   words, I am promoting the purpose of Christmas (3:8), the purpose   of the incarnation. Then he adds (2:2), "And if anyone sins, we   have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and   He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours   only, but also for those of the whole world."        Implications for Your Life        But now look what this means: it means that Jesus appeared in   the world for two reasons. He came that we might not go on   sinning; and he came to die so that there would be a propitiation   &#91;a substitutionary sacrifice that takes away the wrath of   God&#93; for our sins, if we do sin.        Now ponder this remarkable situation with me in a few closing   minutes. If the Son of God came to help you stop sinning - to   destroy the works of the devil -and if he also came to die so   that, when you do sin, there is a propitiation -a removal of God's   wrath - then what does this imply for living your life?        Three things. And they are wonderful to have. I give them to   you briefly as Christmas presents.        







1. A Clear   Purpose for Living        It implies that you have a clear purpose for living in 1999   -the last year of this century and this millennium. Negatively, it   is simply this: don't sin. "I write these things to you so that   you may not sin" (2:1). "The Son of God appeared to destroy the   works of the devil" (3:8).        If you ask, "Can you give us that positively, instead of   negatively, the answer is: Yes, it's all summed up in 1 John 3:23.   It's a great summary of what the whole book requires. Notice the   singular "commandment": "This is His commandment, that we believe   in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as   He commanded us." These two things are so closely connected for   John he calls them one commandment: believe Jesus and love others.   That is your purpose in 1999. That is the sum of the Christian   life. Trusting Jesus, loving people. Trust Jesus, love people.   There's the first gift: a purpose to live.        







2. Hope that   Our Failures Will Be Forgiven        Now consider the second implication of the twofold truth that   Christ came to destroy our sinning and to forgive our sins. It's   this: We make progress in overcoming our sin when we have hope   that our failures will be forgiven. If you don't have hope that   God will forgive your failures, when you start fighting sin, you   give up.        Many of you are pondering some changes in the new year, because   you have fallen into sinful patterns and want out. You want some   new patterns of eating. New patterns of TV watching. New patterns   of giving. New patterns of relating to your spouse. New patterns   of family devotions. New patterns of sleep and exercise. New   patterns of courage in witness. But you are struggling, wondering   whether it's any use. Well here's your second Christmas present:   Christ not only came to destroy the works of the devil - our   sinning - he also came to be an advocate for us when we fail in   our fight.        So I plead with you, let the freedom to fail give you the hope   to fight. But beware! If you turn the grace of God into license,   and say, "Well, if I can fail, and it doesn't matter, then why   bother fighting?" - if you say that, and mean it, and go on acting   on it, you are probably not born again and should tremble. But   that is not where most of you are. Most of you want to fight   sinful patterns in your life. And what God is saying to you this   morning is this: let the freedom to fail give you hope to fight. I   preach to you that you might not sin, but if you sin you have an   advocate, Jesus Christ.        







3. Christ Will   Help Us        Finally, the third implication of the double truth that Christ   came to destroy our sinning and to forgive our sins, is this:   Christ will really help us in our fight. He really will help you.   He is on your side. He didn't come to destroy sin because sin is   fun. He came to destroy sin because it is fatal. It is a deceptive   work of the devil and will destroy us if we don't fight it. He   came to help us, not hurt us.        So here's your third Christmas gift: Christ will help overcome   sin in you in 1999. 1 John 4:4 says, "He who is in you is greater   than he that is in the world." Jesus is alive, Jesus is almighty,   Jesus lives in us by faith. And Jesus is for us, not against us.   He will help you. Trust him.        Summary        In summary, three gifts: because Christ came to destroy sinning   and to forgive sins        1. We have a clear purpose for living in 1999: fight sin. Trust   Jesus and love others.        2. The freedom to fail gives us hope in the fight.        3. Jesus will really help us. He really will. Trust him.        Copyright 1998 John Piper
