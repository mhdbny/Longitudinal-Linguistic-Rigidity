  July 10, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    Dr. Tom Schreiner       LOVING ONE ANOTHER FULFILLS THE LAW    (Romans 13:8-10)        Owe nothing to anyone except to love oneanother; for      he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. For this, "You      shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not      steal, You shall not covet," and if there is any other      commandment, it is summed up in this saying, "You shall love      your neighbor as yourself." Love does no wrong to a neighbor;      love therefore is the fulfillment of thelaw.         All you need is love       The Beatles wrote a popular song titled, "All You Need is   Love." This seems to be the same thing that the Apostle Paul is   saying in Rom. 13:8-10, for he says that the only thing we owe one   another is love and that love fulfills the law. What we need to do   in each situation of life, then, is to ask ourselves: what is the   most loving thing to do in this circumstance? How can I show love   to my neighbors? These questions are certainly the right ones to   ask, but we could be misled into thinking that the most loving   thing for neighbors is obvious and apparent to all. Most secular   people would agree with the Beatles that all we need is love, and   they would salute Paul for the same opinion. But neither the   Beatles nor secular people really agree with Paul on what love is.   Paul would say that the most loving thing you could do for   neighbors is persuade them to repent of their sins and believe in   Jesus Christ. The Beatles certainly did not believe that, nor do   most people in this world. Even though all people would agree that   we should love our neighbors, they would not agree on what love   for neighbors looks like--even Christians disagree because they do   not know the scriptures well. And for those of us who are   believers the authoritative and inerrant scriptures define for us   the nature of love. I think these verses in Rom. 13:8-10 suggest   that there are two mistakes that we may fall into in defining what   love is. We will look at them one at a time.       No need for commandments?       What is the first blunder in judgment? The first mistake is to   say that since love fulfills the law we no longer have any need   for commandments. Some people understand these verses to say that   the only moral guideline Christians need is love. After all, verse   8 says that the only thing we owe one another is love, and that   the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. Furthermore,   v. 9 says that the different commands of the law are summed up in   love. They argue, therefore, that we don't actually need   commandments anymore. All we need to ask ourselves about any   course of action is found in v. 10. Does our action actually hurt   our neighbor? If it does not hurt our neighbor, if it does our   neighbor good, then that action must be loving, and thus we   fulfill the law, for Paul says in v. 10 that love is the   fulfillment of the law. Those who believe this way bristle against   imposing any commands upon believers. They think this is a form of   legalism. They condemn as legalism any commands which say "you   should do this, " or "you should not do this." They insist that   believers are not under any "commands," except the command to love   one another.       In most errors there is a grain of truth, and I will return   later to the element of truth present in this view. But at this   point I want to put the spotlight on the massive error which is   found in this view. When Paul says that love is the fulfillment of   the law, he does not intend to say that we have no need for   commandments. To say that love is the fulfillment of the law does   not imply that we can dispense with all commandments. Instead,   specific commandments are mentioned in v. 9 so that we will see   how love looks in action. One cannot commit adultery, murder,   steal, and covet and claim to be loving. Specific commandments are   given so that we will see in a concrete and practical way how love   manifests itself in everyday life.       Paul only lists four commandments here, but we should not   conclude from this that these are the only 4 commandments we need   to keep in order to be loving. Notice in v. 9 that he adds the   words "if there is any other commandment." In other words, Paul   didn't have the time or space to list all the commandments for his   readers. But his intention is clear. All the moral norms and   absolutes of God's law describe what is involved in being loving.   No one can claim to be loving, while at the same time he or she is   violating God's commandments.       Why is it so important to have commandments in order to love   one another? Because love without commandments so easily descends   into vagueness or sentimentality. We can so easily deceive   ourselves into thinking that we are loving because we have warm   feelings towards other people. Love is easily confused in our   society with being "nice." But "Minnesota nice" does not   necessarily mean that one is acting in a loving manner. A person   can be "nice" and at the same time be guilty of blatantly   violating God's commands.       Illustrations       The word love without commandments is a plastic word which can   be twisted and shaped in many different ways to defend a course of   action which is in fact contrary to God's law. For instance, a   married man may justify an adulterous affair with another woman   because of "love." He could say to himself, "You know it is not   really fair to my present wife, Susan, to continue being married   to her when I do not really feel affection for her. And since my   feelings of love and affection are so strong for my girl friend,   Katherine, they must be from God. Only God would grant me such   delight and happiness in being with another person. I know it   sounds strange, but I believe God really wants me to break off my   marriage with Susan and marry Katherine. God is not the sort of   God who would want me to live miserably with Susan when he has   planted a deep love for Katherine in my heart. God is not a god   who wants people to live together when they are so unhappy, and so   I believe he is leading me to start a new life with Katherine."       All of this sounds very impressive and even "spiritual." But we   know that all of this talk simply rationalizes sin. Love cannot   contradict the commandment, "do not commit adultery."       Or think of this example. Margie is 21 years old and deeply in   love with Greg and they both want to get married. The only problem   is that Greg is not a Christian. Margie, though, is convinced that   these powerful feelings of affection she has for Greg must be from   God. Her pastor counsels her not to marry him, but she believes   that God will use her to bring Greg to the faith. Thus, she goes   ahead and marries him and asks God to bless their union. Once   again, Margie's resolve to marry Greg may sound very spiritual,   especially when she says that the Lord will use her to win Greg.   But her decision to marry Greg violates a specific command of   scripture. 1 Cor. 7:39 says to marry "only in the Lord" which   means that believers must only marry other believers.       Consider another matter: The issue of homosexuality is becoming   more and more controversial in our society. Many people say that   evangelical believers are homophobic and claim that we hate   homosexuals. For instance, an article by Deb Price in the Star   Tribune dated June 22, 1994 says this about those who morally   disapprove of homosexuality. "Hatred is a sickness, discrimination   is a crime and bigotry is a sin." Her intent is clear. The real   sin is not committed by homosexuals, but those who morally condemn   homosexuality are guilty of the sins of hatred and bigotry.   Advocates of homosexuality charge us with being unloving because   we make homosexuals feel bad for their behavior. Indeed, they   would appeal to the law of love in order to defend the rightness   of homosexuality. How can we condemn people, they say, who love   each other, want to be faithful to one another, and are not   hurting anyone else?       Surely if we hate homosexuals, we should repent of this sin and   resolve to love them as we do all other sinners. But we can never   say that loving homosexuals means that we accept homosexual   behavior as morally praiseworthy and loving. And many people today   will say that we "hate" homosexuals if we say their behavior is   wrong. But only God has the prerogative to define what is loving,   and Rom. 1:26-27 clearly teach that homosexual relations are   contrary to nature, that they violate God's intended order in   which one man marries one woman. Those who warn homosexuals about   the evil of their behavior actually love them more than all those   who think there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, for we inform   them of God's perspective on homosexuality. When we say that   homosexual relations are sinful, we are not imposing our opinion   on others, but revealing what God thinks about homosexuality.       Imagine if someone had a bomb in his hand that was due to   detonate in 3 hours. The person holding the bomb really enjoyed   holding it and didn't believe it was a bomb. Some people told him,   "What you are holding in your hand is a bomb. It will explode in   10 minutes and destroy you." Others replied, "How can you be so   unloving and hateful to tell him that what he holds in his hand is   a bomb. Can't you see that he enjoys holding that piece of   equipment? You are shaming him and making him feel bad for holding   this thing, when it is perfectly normal to do so." The people who   defend the person's right to hold the bomb "appear" to be more   loving than those who warn him against it. But after 10 minutes   pass, it will be clear who was really the more loving.       The principle here is easy to see: we cannot let the world   shape our definition of love. We must let God's word in the   scriptures define for us what is loving. Otherwise, we will fall   prey to the deception of the world.       To sum up the first point: certainly love involves more than   the keeping of commandments, but it never involves anything less   than keeping them. Love goes beyond the keeping of God's law, but   it never goes around the keeping of God's law. Commandments guard   us from inadequate definitions of love and provide us with an   objective standard by which we can test our lives. If we claim to   be walking in love but fail to keep God's commandments, then our   profession is contradicted by our practice.       Keeping commandments not necessarily love       The second error is the opposite of the first one. In fact,   those of you who really liked my first point are the ones most apt   to fall prey to the second error. It is also a mistake to say that   keeping commandments is the sum and totality of love. After all,   Paul does emphasize in this text that what we owe our neighbor is   love, that love fulfills the law, that love sums up the   commandments of the, and that love does no wrong to the neighbor.   Love certainly involves the keeping of commandments, but love is   more than the keeping of commands. Love also involves the   affections and motivations of the heart. One can never claim to be   loving while transgressing commandments. But one can be unloving   even while keeping commandments, for love involves the affections   and motivations of the heart. We see this truth in 1 Cor. 13:3,   "If I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver   my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me   nothing." Certainly there is no external violation of God's law in   giving one's money to the poor and in giving up one's life for   another! Indeed, doing these things seems to be a profound   obedience to God's law. And yet Paul explicitly says here that one   may be exceedingly generous to the poor and give up his life for   another person and still be unloving! How can one be unloving and   give all of one's possessions to the poor or sacrifice one's life   so that others may live? Most of us would be inclined to say that   anyone who gave us all his money or gave up his life for our   children must be acting in love. But Paul says, "Not necessarily."   Why? These actions are unloving if the motivation is to gain   glory, honor, and praise for ourselves and if they lack affection   for the people helped.       No one can be loving who violates the commandments, but we may   not be acting in genuine love while keeping the commandments   because we may be keeping them to bring honor and praise to   ourselves instead of to God. True love involves the motivation of   the heart and thus it is deeper than the practicing of certain   commandments. Keeping God's commands is crucial, but love must   retain primacy since our motivation may be idolatrous even in   keeping God's commands.       If love does not retain primacy over commandments, then we are   also in danger of falling into Pharisaism, which is the attempt to   make a rule for every conceivable situation. The Pharisees took   God's commandments so seriously that they compiled another book,   the Mishnah, which described in detail how to keep God's   commandments. This book contains 800 pages of detailed   regulations. In later Jewish history a further explanation of   these 800 pages of rules was compiled, and this consists of more   than 20 volumes and is called the Talmud.       Now there is no doubt that we need God's commandments to   prevent us from sentimentalizing love. But what is remarkable in   reading the NEW TESTAMENT is that love is described in terms of   broad principles and commands. Biblical writers give us enough   commands so that we can describe how love works itself out, but   they do not give us so many that we are lost in a welter of laws   that we can scarcely remember and thereby we lose our freedom in   Christ.       It is so easy for us to impose commandments on others that are   not found in the scriptures, nor can they be defended as valid   implications from biblical teaching. In doing so we become like   the Pharisees in that we add laws to the Bible. Here are some   examples of imposing laws not found in the scripture which I have   heard in my 23 years as a Christian. All Christians must home   school. All Christians should go to public school. No Christian   should ever drink alcohol. Wearing beards is wrong and rebellious.   Christians must do manual labor and work with their hands.   Christians must not eat pork or sugar. Christians should bake   fresh bread every day. All Christians must read the King James   Version. There is nothing wrong, of course, in believers making   their own private decisions on each of these issues, but to impose   them on others and to pretend they are biblical is Pharisaism.       Commandments are guidelines to love       Life is too complex to write down what should be done in every   specific situation. In the tremendous variety of life it is   impossible to specify what should be done in advance in every   case. Scripture does not attempt to delineate for us exactly what   we should do in every circumstance. Instead, it says that love is   the baseline for our behavior and love in turn asks what is the   best for a neighbor in each situation as it arises.       The difficulty of discerning what is best for the neighbor in   terms of love is revealed in Phil. 1:9-11. "And this I pray that   your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all   discernment, so that you may approve the things that are   excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of   Christ, having been filled with fruit of righteousness which comes   through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God." Paul prays   that our love will grow in discernment, so that we will choose   what is excellent. In the complexity of life we don't always know   what is excellent and what is the most loving, and thus we need   wisdom to discern what is the most loving action in various   circumstances. Should we fire the employee that is doing poor work   or give him another chance? How much time should we spend with our   families and how much time in other ministry? What is the best way   to respond to non-believers with whom we work? Sometimes it seems   best to confront them with evil, but often we overlook their evil   because we know the root problem is that they are unregenerate. It   is not easy to know the best way to respond in each situation.   There is no one right and simple answer to these questions. The   difficulty of deciding what is the most loving in each   circumstance explains why Paul says in Eph. 5:10 that we must test   what is pleasing to the Lord. This implies that it is not always   immediately clear what is the best course of action, what is the   most loving thing to do.       The commandments God gives us are like the banks of a river   which control the general flow of the river. When we violate God's   commandments we cause the river to run over the banks, and thus it   loses its power and beauty. If we add commandments not found in   the scriptures, we widen the banks of the river so that it becomes   slow and stagnant and loses its life and vitality. And within the   stream of the river there are numerous decisions that need to be   made which cannot be specified in advance. The Bible does not   anticipate every situation we will encounter. We need the Holy   Spirit and wisdom to discern what is best to do as different   instances arrive in our life. Scripture informs us that love is   the guideline. But there is no attempt to calculate in advance   what we should do in each circumstance of life. We read the   scriptures, pray, seek wisdom, and rely upon the Spirit    in attempting to discern God's will.       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
