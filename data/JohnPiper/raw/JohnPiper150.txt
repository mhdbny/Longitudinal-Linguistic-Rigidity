  June 15, 1986Bethlehem Baptist ChurchJohn Piper, PastorCopyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper    FATHERS WHO GIVE HOPE  (Col. 3:21) Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged. Our text is straightforward and simple this morning: "Fathers, do not provokeyour children, lest they become discouraged." It divides naturally into threeparts: First there is the address, "Fathers." Second, there is the command,"Do not provoke your children." Third, there is the purpose of the command,"Lest they become discouraged." We will look at these three parts of the text one at a time in reverse order.First we will direct our attention to the goal of Christian fathers, namely,rearing children who are not discouraged. Second, we will look at the dutyof Christian fathers, namely, not to do those things that discourage children.And finally we will focus on the leader in Christian parenthood, namely,fathers. But first a word about the fatherhood of God. In the Lord's prayer Jesus taught his disciples to call God Father: "OurFather who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name." He taught that God is noteveryone's Father. In John 8:42,44 he said to those who refused to followhim, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and cameforth from God... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to doyour father's desires." God is the Father only of those who are led by the Spirit of his Son. InRomans 8:9,14-15 Paul says, Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him....All who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. For you did notreceive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have receivedthe Spirit of sonship. When we cry, "Abba! Father!" it is the Spirit himselfbearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God. Not every one can lay claim to the privilege of knowing God as Father. Onlythose who born of God (John 1:13), who receive Christ (John 1:12), and whoare led by the Spirit (Romans 8:14) have the right to receive the inheritanceof the the children -- promises like Matthew 7:11, "If you then, who areevil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will yourFather who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" The privilegeof prayer and the promise that God will work all things together for yourgood is part of the inheritance of sonship. That is what it means to haveGod as your Father. There are two reasons I begin with this word about the Fatherhood of God.One is that I believe all human fatherhood should be patterned on the divinefatherhood. The overarching guide for every father should be to live in sucha way that his children can see what God the Father is like. They ought tosee in their human father a reflection -- albeit imperfect -- of the heavenlyFather in his strength and tenderness, in his wrath and mercy, in his exaltationand condescension, in his surpassing wisdom and patient guidance. The taskof every human father is to be for his children an image the Father in heaven. The other reason I begin with the fatherhood of God is to give this messagerelevance for everyone in this room whether you are a father or not; andwhether you had a Christian father or not. I want to make clear from theoutset that the sadness many may feel at never having had a father like thefather I will describe, and the sadness others may feel at never having beena father like the father I will describe -- that sadness can be swallowedup and overcome with joy this morning because God offers his fatherhood toanyone who will accept the gift of adoption by trusting Christ and yieldingto be led by the Holy Spirit. There are two ways to listen to this message this morning. One is to takeit as a straightforward exhortation from the Word of God to fathers how torear their children. The other is to take it as a parable pointing to theway the Father in heaven loves those who believe and follow his Son. FranklyI hope all of you hear it in both senses.  1. "...lest they become discouraged." Let's go to the text and begin with the last phrase of Colossians 3:21, "Fathers,do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged." The goal of a good father is to rear children who are not discouraged. Theword implies losing heart, being listless, spiritless, disinterested, moody,sullen, with a kind of blank resignation toward life. Don't be the kind offather who rears that kind of person. Instead develop a style of fatherhoodthat produces the opposite of discouragement. Now what is that? I would sum it up in three characteristics. * The opposite of being discouraged is being hopeful. * The opposite of being discouraged is being happy. * The opposite of being discouraged is being confident and courageous. So I would say that the negative form of verse 21 really implies a positivecommand as well. It says, "Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest theybecome discouraged." But it means not only avoid one kind of fatherhood;it also means pursue another kind, namely, the kind of fatherhood which giveshope instead of discouragement; and gives happiness instead of discouragement;and gives confidence and courage. If we stopped right here we would not have said anything distinctly Christian.There is not one parent in ten thousand who thinks that the aim of parenthoodshould be to discourage children. But the apostle Paul would be distressedif all I did were to use his words here simply to express some everyday commonsense, or some natural wisdom. He was not inspired by the Holy Spirit toconfirm the insights of Dr. Spock. He was inspired to teach parents thingsthat no natural eye has seen and no natural ear has heard (1 Cor. 2:9-13). Here is what I mean. Paul's teaching makes it clear that when he says weshould be fathers who give hope instead of discouragement, he means hopein GOD not hope in money or hope in popularity or hope in education or hopein a spouse or hope in professional success. If you had asked Paul, or Jesus,"What kind of freedom from discouragement do you want our children to have?"he would not have said, "I want your children to be freed from discouragementby being filled with hope that they will become wealthy...or well-known,or intellectual, or married, or successful." We know that is not what hemeans. He means, be the kind of fathers who do not discourage your childrenbut rather fill them with hope in God. And when we consider happiness as the opposite of discouragement, Paul wouldnot be content if a father simply made his child feel good by giving himwhatever he wanted. There is a happiness that kills. To some kinds of happinessthe Scripture says, "Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joyto dejection" (James 4:9). There is a happiness that has nothing to do withGod, and therefore has no value in the sight of God. It comes from the creationalone and not from the Creator. That isn't what Paul wants fathers to putin the place of discouragement. But there is another joy that comes to expression, for example, in Psalm4:7-8,         Thou hast put more joy in my heart       than they have when their grain and wine abound.       In peace I will both lie down and sleep;       for thou alone, O lord, makest me dwell in safety.  Fathers, don't discourage your children, but fill them with joy in God! Teachthem early on -- and show them earlier yet -- that through many sufferingsthey must enter the Kingdom (Acts 14:22), but that they can rejoice insufferings, knowing that "suffering produces endurance, and endurance producescharacter, and character produces hope" -- IN GOD! (Romans 5:3-4). Don'tdiscourage them. Make them happy in God by helping them to hope in God. And when we consider confidence as the opposite of discouragement the messageof Scripture takes a dramatic turn away from the common sense natural wisdomof the world. The world says: Don't discourage a child, build up his self-confidence. TheScripture says, Don't discourage a child, build up his God-confidence. Infact the Scripture is more precise than that: it teaches, Don't discouragea child, but do your best to root out his self-confidence and replace itwith a confidence in God. And when it teaches us to root out self-confidence,it means root out the desire to be and to appear self-confident. The Scripture knows that most people don't succeed in being self-confident.Most people are quite unhappy about their inability to appear self-reliantand and self-assured and cool and in control. So when the Scripture teachesus to root out self-confidence it means go for the root, not the half-witheredbranches. Go for the DESIRE to be self-confident, not the meager manifestationsof it that make their way into peoples' actions. One vivid illustration of how Paul's heavenly Father was patiently workingto root out Paul's self-confidence is given in 2 Corinthians 1:8-9. Hereis a description of how God the Father was working on Paul twenty years afterhis conversion, which means this is a very deeply rooted sin in all of us.He writes, We do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of the affliction we experiencedin Asia; for we were so utterly, unbearably crushed that we despaired oflife itself. Why, we felt that we had received the sentence of death; butthat was to make us rely (or: be confident_ not on ourselves but on God whoraises the dead. In other words, the divine purpose of Paul's affliction was (as it is thepurpose of all good fatherly discipline) to root out the remainingself-confidence of Paul's heart and to cast him on God alone. Why? BecauseGod didn't want him to be confident? Because he wanted him to be listless,spiritless, moody, sullen, weak, fearful? No! It was God who came to Paulin Corinth and said, "Do NOT be afraid, but speak and do NOT be silent; forI am with you." So the confidence that we are to build into our childrenis not self-confidence, but confidence in the grace and power of God. "Donot be afraid...I AM WITH YOU." Andrew Bonar, the l9th century Scottish pastor, said concerning the teachingof children, "We tell them, 'You are sinners, exposed to God's wrath andcurse, and you cannot save yourselves; but God's own Son can save you, byHimself bearing that wrath and curse.'" In other words you teach a childto despair of all self-confidence and direct his desire for confidence tothe grace of God. The goal of Biblical fathers is to have children who say(with Psalm 60:11-12):  O grant us help against the foe, for vain is the help of man! With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes."  A good father will ponder: How can I be like my own heavenly Father? Howcan I banish self-reliance from the heart of my children and fill them withconfidence and courage and zeal and boldness that are rooted in the graceand power of God and not in themselves? How can I be the kind of father whosechildren do not lose heart or become spiritless or listless or sullen ordiscouraged, but are filled with hope in God and happiness in God and confidencein God and courage to attempt great things for the glory of God? That question leads us to turn now to the second part of our text, namelythe duty of Christian parents not to provoke their children.  2. "Do not provoke your children." "Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged." Againwe notice that the commandment is negative -- something to be avoided. Itis a warning against the misuse of legitimate authority. Paul has just saidin verse 20, "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleasesthe Lord." That gives to parents tremendous authority and responsibilityunder God. Children are to do what parents say. Now in verse 21 he cautions fathers against a misuse of this God-given authority.The misuse he has in mind is that fathers might treat their children in sucha way that their spirit is broken and they become hopelessly discouraged.Paul calls this misuse "provoking" them: "Do not provoke your children." In Ephesians 6:4 a different word is used that specifically means, "Do notprovoke to anger." But this is a very general word here in Colossians 3:21.It can even be used positively in 2 Corinthians 9:2 where it says that theChristians in Achaia provoked the Christians in Macedonia to be more generous."In other words, they "stirred them up," or "motivated" them. In choosing the broad and general word I think Paul would have us teach thatparents should avoid everything that ruins a child's confidence in God andleaves him hopeless and discouraged. This requires tremendous wisdom fromfathers, because not all short term discouragements result in long termhopelessness. On the contrary, our heavenly Father clearly brings short termfrustrations and discouragements into our lives precisely to put us on anew footing of faith. Great wisdom is needed here. So let's ask then, What do fathers do that provoke children to long-termdiscouragement and hopelessness? I'll mention two things. First, some fathers fail to BE happy and hopeful and confident in God. Fathers,what you ARE in relation to God is far more important than any particularparenting technique you try to employ. Will your children hope in God ifyou hope in money? Will your children be happy in God if they see that fishingis a happier experience for you than worship? Will your children be confidentin God if your whole demeanor communicates the desire to be seen as aself-confident? The most important work that a father can do for the sake of his childrenis to be converted. The most important strategy for rearing children is tobecome a new man in Christ -- whose hope and happiness and confidence arein God and not in himself. We know this is true from Scripture because there we are taught to imitateour heavenly Father. We are told to be holy as he IS holy (l Peter l:l6).We are told to be merciful as he IS merciful (Luke 6:36). To be a good childis to copy daddy. It honors a father to be imitated, and we are commandedto honor our fathers. And so the most important question a father can askis not what shall I teach my children, but rather who am I before the livingGod and before my children? That is the first thing that fathers can do to provoke their children tolong-term discouragement and hopelessness -- they can fail to BE hopeful,happy and confident in God. The second thing that fathers do which provokes children to long termdiscouragement and hopelessness is to discipline them in an impulsive, erraticand inconsistent way. Unpredictable, impulsive, hostile discipline makes children fearful, bitter,deceitful and discouraged. They don't know where or why the explosion willcome next. They say to themselves, "What's the use! How can I hope that beinggood is any better than being bad?" And so the spirit of moral hope is broken,and in its place comes calculated, deceitful, discouraged maneuvering. On the other hand, when discipline is controlled and appropriate and consistentand based on clear rules and principles of justice in the home, an atmosphereis created where children flourish in freedom. They know the limits and theyfeel secure and free to dream and play and plan and work inside those limitsof righteousness. They gain confidence that this is the way God is. He is not a capriciousGod. He is not impulsive or erratic or inconsistent. There is order. Thereis justice tempered with mercy. There is hope and encouragement. Why I mighteven be able to accomplish something of value or even greatness if I fitinto this order and depend on the goodness of the Father who loves me likethis. So fathers, don't provoke your children by being impulsive, erratic orinconsistent in your discipline. Be like your Father in heaven, so that yourchildren can know him and become hopeful and happy and confident in him. Much more could be said about the kinds of things that provoke long-term,discouragement and hopelessness in children. But time is out.  3. "Fathers..." We can only briefly refer to the third part of the text, namely the address:"Fathers..." Verse 20 said, "Children, obey your parents." This clearly teachesthat mothers as well as fathers are to be obeyed. Mothers and fathers havea shared authority over the children. But in verse 21 fathers are addressedin particular. Why this is so is the issue we will take up tonight. There is a peculiarrole that the Scripture gives to husbands and fathers. Fathers bear a specialresponsibility for the moral life of the family. So I urge you to take thatresponsibility, fathers, and that you be the kind of man who gives hope andhappiness and confidence to your children because you yourself have foundyour hope and your happiness and your confidence in God.
