    April 2, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     The Depth of Christ&#146;s Love: ItsUndeserving Objects   (Romans 5:1-11)          Therefore having been justified by faith,we have peace with God    through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we haveobtained our introduction by    faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope ofthe glory of God. And not    only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing thattribulation brings about    perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and provencharacter, hope; and hope    does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured outwithin our hearts through    the Holy Spirit who was given to us. For while we were stillhelpless, at the right time    Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for arighteous man; though perhaps    for the good man someone would dare even to die. But Goddemonstrates His own love toward    us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Muchmore then, having now been    justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of Godthrough him. For if while    we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death ofhis Son, much more, having    been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not onlythis, but we also exult in    God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have nowreceived the reconciliation.             Review      If someone performs an act of lovetoward you, there are four  ways that you can see the depth of that love.     One is by the  costliness  of the deed.How much inconvenience or  sacrifice did it cost the one who loved you? The greater thesacrifice the deeper the  love. If it cost an afternoon of time and sweat, it is one degreeof love. If it cost his  life, it another degree of love.     A second way to see the depth of love is by thehow  undeserving   you are of the act of love. Jesus said,          If you love those who love you, whatreward have you? Do not even    the tax-gatherers do the same? And if you greet your brothersonly, what do you do more  than    others?  Do not even the Gentiles do the same? (Matt.5:46-47)         In other words the depth of our love is shownnot just in the measure  of our sacrifice but in whether we will give it to people whodon&#146;t return it -- and  who may not deserve it at all. The love that overwhelms us is thelove that comes to us  authentically from those we have deeply wronged.    A third way to see the depth of love is by the greatness of the  benefit  that comes to us by the act of love. If a personclaims to love us with  sacrifice, but we are not really helped by their love, we mightbegin to wonder if this  kind of love really means anything. Love is not just making asacrifice. Love is making a  contribution to someone&#146;s life -- at least that&#146;s theintention. And the greater  the gift, the more amazing the love. John wrote,           See how great a love the Father hasbestowed upon us, that we    should be called children of God. (1 John 3:1)        The greatness of God&#146;s love is seen in theincredible benefit of  being made children of God.    Finally, we see the depth of love which someoneshows to us by how  free   the act of love is. If, for ten or fifteen years, I tell my son toget his brother a  birthday present, and even sometimes buy it for him so he&#146;llhave something to give,  that is one degree of love between brothers. But if, in his firstyear away from home at  age nineteen, he calls, without a reminder from his parents, theweek before his  brother&#146;s birthday and tells me he knows of a store wherethere is a special knife  sharpener his little brother really wants, and asks me to take themoney from his account  and buy it for him, then love is manifest in a whole new way.    Jesus has loved us in all these ways to adegree that is beyond human  comprehension. Last week we saw the depth of his love for us inthe degree of his  sacrifice -- he gave his life for us, and what a life it was togive! Today we will see  the depth of his love -- especially his Father&#146;s love -- inhow undeserving we were  to receive it.    The aim in these messages is to sink the rootsour lives into the  ground of God&#146;s love that has no bottom, so that we will befirm and unshakable, and  so that we will have the nutriments of God&#146;s very loveflowing in the branches of our  lives to bear the costly and beautiful fruit of love for eachother to eat.       The key to comprehending theincomprehensible love of Christ:  The Holy Spirit      I said, Jesus has loved us in all thesefour ways to a degree that  is beyond human comprehension. Let&#146;s start there thismorning. If that&#146;s true  then what hope is there that I could might help you comprehend thelove of God and the  love of Christ for you? What is the basis of my hope that throughmy preaching you might  actually experience the incomprehensible depth of Christ&#146;slove? The answer is given  in this text.    In Romans 5:3 Paul calls us to exult in ourtribulations           knowing that tribulation brings aboutperseverance; 4 and    perseverance , [brings about]  proven character; andproven character,  [brings    about]  hope; 5 and hope does not disappoint, because thelove of God  [that is,    God&#146;s love for us, not ours for him, as the next verseswill show]  has been    poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who wasgiven to us.        Here&#146;s the basis of my hope this morningthat in my preaching  about the love of God and Christ for you, you will actuallyexperience that love, and  comprehend in some significant, life-changing measure theincomprehensible love of Christ.  The basis of my hope is that God has given you -- who arebelievers in Christ --  the  Holy Spirit . You see that at the end of verse 5:  . . .the Holy Spirit,  who  was given to us . As you sit there, the Holy Spirit ofGod dwells in you. He is  in you.           Your body is a temple of the HolySpirit who is in you, whom you    have from God. (1 Cor. 6:19)         If this were not so my aims in preaching aboutlove to this church  would be futile. I am preaching to people who are indwelt by theHoly Spirit of the living  God. And to some who yet can be indwelt by this Spirit of God.How? Acts 2:38 says,           Repent, and let each of you be baptizedin the name of Jesus Christ    for the forgiveness of your sins; and  you shall receive thegift of the Holy Spirit .          The Holy Spirit and the role ofpreaching      Now how does the presence of the HolySpirit give me confidence  that my preaching on the love of God for you will result in a realexperience of that  love? Answer: because verse 5 says that the work of the HolySpirit is to be the Agent of  God in pouring his love out into your heart. Verse 5:           Hope does not disappoint, because thelove of God has been poured    out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit.         One of the main reasons God has given the HolySpirit to you, is so  that he might pour out God&#146;s love into your heart.     Do you see what this means? It means thatwithout the supernatural work  of Holy Spirit, we cannot experience and comprehend the love ofGod in Christ. The love of  God is a divine and supernatural reality. But you and I, apartfrom the Holy Spirit, are  merely natural and unspiritual, and we do not recognize or valuethe love of God in  Christ. But when God opens our eyes to his truth, and the HolySpirit comes into our  hearts by faith, he awakens us to the reality of God&#146;s loveand begins to pour it out  into our hearts.    This should greatly encourage some of you whofeel that your background  makes it difficult, if not impossible, for you to feel loved. Thefact is, it is not only  difficult, it is impossible -- and not just for you, but for allof us. O, this is so  important to grasp. Apprehending the love of God for you --experiencing it, being gripped  by it, tasting it -- is   not   the product of goodpreaching plus good family  background. It is not the product of merely natural forces -- goodor bad. It the work of  God, the Holy Spirit. The love of God is poured out into ourhearts by the Holy Spirit.  Without that you can have the best family background in thecountry, and you will never  truly know the love of God. And   with that,   you canhave the worst family  background, and the Holy Spirit will pour the love of God intoyour heart.    But someone may ask, Where does preaching fitinto this? What does what  I am doing right now have to do with the work of the Holy Spiritpouring out the love of  God into our hearts? The answer is given in verses 6-8 and theconnection that they have  with verse 5.    Verse 6 begins:            For  while we were still helpless, atthe right time Christ died    for the ungodly.        Notice the connection. In verse 6 what we haveis the recounting of a  historical fact. Christ died. And we have the meaningof that fact, that is,  God&#146;s purpose in it: Christ died,   for theungodly   -- to  take the place of the ungodly, to save the ungodly.   Nowthis is different from  verse 5. In verse 5 we have Christian experience -- the HolySpirit pouring out the love  of God in our hearts. In verse 6 we have history (Christdied), and we have  theology (Christ to save the ungodly).    And the connection between the history and thetheology on the one hand  (v. 6), and the experience on the other hand (v. 5), is that thehistory and theology are  the  foundation   and context  of the experience.What&#146;s happening is this.  Paul has said that the Holy Spirit pours the love of God into ourhearts. But then he  shows us what that love is. And he bases it on history. This meansthat the work of the  Holy Spirit in your heart is not to give the content of the loveof God. It is not the job  of the Holy Spirit to describe the love of God to you. That is thejob God has assigned to  history and to the Word of Scripture that interprets that history,and to preaching which  brings them both to bear upon your mind.    You  learn  the nature and content of thelove of God from the way  that love acted in history in Jesus Christ, and you experience  that love as a  present life-changing reality as the Holy Spirit pours it out intoyour heart. Both of  these are utterly crucial. If we make claims to have experiencesof the love of God  without solid foundations in history and its God-given meaning, webecome cultic,  emotionalistic, fanatical; and if we claim to understand thehistory and the meaning of  history but we don&#146;t experience the love of God poured outinto our hearts by the  Holy Spirit, we become barren and impotent andintellectualistic.    The point is this; my message this morningcannot take the place of the  Holy Spirit in your life. And the Holy Spirit will not do the workassigned to the Word of  God. My calling is to describe the love of God to you. His callingis to pour it out in  your hearts. My calling is to point you to what Christ did; hiscalling is to open your  eyes to see it as glorious and personal. My calling is to make itplain; his is to make it  precious. Mine is to make it clear; his is to make it dear. Mineis to take you on a tour  around the deep and scenic lake of the love of God; his is toplunge you in and saturate  your life with the love of God -- to baptize you in it.      While we were yet sinners      So come with me now as we look at thedepth of the love of God  in Christ. And the way we see it this morning is in howundeserving we were to receive it.  Verses 6-8 give the description of God&#146;s love that the HolySpirit pours out into our  hearts:          For   while we were still helpless,at the right time Christ    died for the ungodly. 7 For one will hardly die for a righteousman; though perhaps for    the good man someone would dare even to die. 8 But Goddemonstrates His own love toward    us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died forus.        Now the central fact of the love of God is thatChrist died for us.  This is what we focused on last week -- Christ sacrificed his life-- not just his time  and energy and convenience and money and health -- he sacrificedhis life -- his sinless,  holy, tender, wise, loving, divine life.     But that is not Paul&#146;s focus in theseverses. Here the focus is on  the moral condition of those he died for. This is what shows thelove of Christ to be so  amazing. This is what the Holy Spirit will pour into your heartsafresh this morning.       Let&#146;s begin with the comparison that Paulmakes to human love in  verse 7:             One will hardly die for a righteous man;though perhaps for the    good man someone would dare even to die.          The point here is to show that human loverarely reaches high enough to  die for someone who has been especially good to us. And almostnever would human love  sacrifice itself for one who is simply a just and principledperson. In other words, if  you take the two best candidates of love -- the just and uprightcitizen; and the kind and  generous person who has been good to you -- the likelihood thatmere human love would give  its life for them is very small.    In contrast with this, Paul describes the loveof God. Verse 8:           But God demonstrates His own lovetoward us . . .         Just stop there for a moment. Put this togetherwith verse 5. Here God  demonstrates   his love. There the Holy Spirit  pours out  his love. Doyou see this? We see the  demonstration of the love of God in history and in his Word; butwe experience the  application of the love of God by the outpouring work of the HolySpirit in our heart.     Now back to the contrast with merely human lovethat scarcely will die  for a good man. Verse 8:           But God demonstrates His own love towardus, in that  while    we were yet sinners,  Christ died for us.        The depth of God&#146;s love for us -- andChrist&#146;s love for us --  is seen in this: when he chose to love us, even at the cost ofJesus&#146; life, we were  not worthy of his love. In fact we were worthy of his wrath. Wedeserved his punishment  for our sins against him. And his love is shown in this -- exactlyin this -- that his  love did not wait for any moral improvement in us. The fullsacrifice was made while we  were still sinners.     Paul heightens this with three other words. Twoof them in verse 6:     While we were still  helpless  , at the right time  Christ died for the   ungodly  .     Christ loved us and gave himself for us whilewe were  helpless and while we were ungodly.    Helpless implies weak, sickly,unable to impress or make  any contribution to our salvation. Paul said           God has chosen the  weak things  ofthe world to shame the    things which are strong . . . that no man should boast beforeGod.        The love of God is given to the unlikely andunworthy so that we will  never boast before God. We will always be humbled that sheer, freemercy saved us.    But we were not only helpless, we wereungodly. The word  means irreverent. We did not fear God. We had no respect for God.We were godless. This is  the way we were when he loved us and gave his Son for us. What isso remarkable about this  word ungodly is that it is used in Romans 1:18 wherePaul says,      The wrath of God is revealed fromheaven against  all  ungodliness .      Which means that, for all of you who trustChrist, the love of God  overcame the wrath of God, and saved you. So you were guiltysinners, you were weak and  helpless, and you were ungodly and deserving of the just and holywrath of God. And in  spite of all that he loved you and gave his Son to die that youmight live.    There is one last description of us asundeserving. It&#146;s in verse  10:           For if while we were  enemies , wewere reconciled to God    through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled,we shall be saved by His    life.        This is a good place to end, because afterEaster when we turn our  minds and our hearts to the way love works and looks among us andin the world, we are  going to hear loud and clear the words of Jesus,           You have heard that it was said,YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR    NEIGHBOR, and hate your enemy. But I say to you, love yourenemies, and pray for    those who persecute you. (Matt. 5:43-44)        Here is the foundation and the source of thatlove. Romans 5:10,             While we were yet enemies, we werereconciled to God through the death    of his Son.          God loved us while we were enemies. Godsacrificed his Son for us while  we were enemies.    Send your roots down into this love. Drinkdeeply from this love. Build  your life on this love. And if you long to experience it more andmore -- as I surely do  -- pray with me, and fast with me, and yearn with me, that Godwould pour his love out in  our hearts by the Holy Spirit. This is revival. This is the greatawakening we pray for.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
