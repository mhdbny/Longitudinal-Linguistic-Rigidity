      October 1, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church:   Volume 2    A Passion for the Supremacy of God . ..for the Joy of All  Peoples   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document       Introduction: Serving the Purposes of God In Our OwnGeneration     As we begin to unpack the  MissionStatement  this morning I  want to put the whole thing in the context of Acts 13:36. Listento these words of Paul to  the synagogue in Pisidian Antioch:           David, after he had  served the purposeof God in his own    generation , fell asleep, and was laid among hisfathers.        One simple and crucial point I want to draw outfor us: the people whom  God raises up from generation to generation are meant mainly toserve the purpose of God  in  their generation . This is true of people and it is true ofchurches. It may be that in  some cases God will cause the ministry of a church or a person togo on ministering long  after they are gone. But that is not to be the burden of ourministry. It may be our  prayer -- that the ripple effect of our lives will go on forChrist&#146;s sake after we  are dead. But God&#146;s will for us is that the burden of ourministry be on this  generation. David served the purpose of God  in his owngeneration . His  ministry goes on through Psalms and through his seed. But they arethe providential  ripples of a life given to the purpose of God for hisgeneration.    Now why is this important for our missionstatement as a church?  It&#146;s important because we need to realize how historicallyconditioned we are when we  write a mission statement. We are shaped by a thousand forces thataffect how we conceive  our mission statement and express it for our generation --personality, family,  friendships, language, education, location, media, travel,tragedy, age, employment,  economics, reading, health, denomination, prayer, theology,devotion, worship, etc. etc.  Our mission statement was not dropped from heaven culture-free. Ithas been forged in the  fires of 30 people&#146;s hearts and lives as they have beenshaped by God through ten  thousand varied circumstances.    I say this to humble us and I say it toencourage us. It humbles us  because it guards us from thinking we have come up with somethingthat would be the best  way to say it everywhere and in every generation. We make no suchclaim. We are simply  trying to serve the purpose of God in our generation. There arereasons for every word in  the Statement. But a good case could be made for other words and adifferent way of saying  it, or even a different biblical focus and emphasis. But this isthe way we believe God  has led us to say it, and the emphasis he wants us to have in ourchurch at this place and  this time. This is our mission to our generation from theBethlehem that God has been  creating over the recent decades.    But I say this not only to humble us, but alsoto encourage us. We do  not bear the burden of saying the last word of truth. God has thatword. We do not bear  the burden of infallibility. We ascribe that to God and hisrevealed word, the Bible. We  do not bear the burden of permanence. Ways of saying great thingscome and go. We do not  need to fight to make this statement permanent. God and his truthare permanent.                 The grass withers and the flowerfalls, but the Word of the Lord      abides for ever (1 Peter 1:24).             We can be encouraged that what we have here isnot on a par with the  Bible, let alone God. Rather it is, we believe -- and this ismightily encouraging -- a  faithful rendering by one group of God&#146;s people, in oneplace, in one time, under  these providential influences, of God&#146;s special call on ourchurch. We are not on a  crusade to get everybody to say it the way we say it. In fact thebody of Christ would  lose something if that happened. We have a contribution to make tothe body, and we have a  witness to make to the world. And we believe it is God-given,without contradicting many  of the great mission statements that other churches design.    I ask you to hear everything I say under thisbanner. What I am saying  here is simply a fleshing out of values that have been clarifiedamong us by the Master  Planning Team. Look, for example, at the left column on page 4:                  In the light of our  Mission and the  Spiritual      Dynamic  that drives it, the following  Values  gripus as we reflect and pray      over our particular circumstances and constituency as achurch, in this metropolitan area,      with these surrounding neighborhoods, at this time inredemptive history .             You see that built right into our document isthe conviction of Acts  13:36 -- David served the purpose of God in his generation. Thatis our aim as well.    And one of those values is #20 near the bottomof page 6: We value                  serving and being enriched by thewider movement of God&#146;s      Spirit across church and cultural lines .             One of my purposes in these messages is to helpyou catch the spirit of  this document. You will miss the heartbeat if you do not hear alonging be a servant  church in the wider movement of God&#146;s Spirit today. And aservant that is so  painfully aware of the dangers of pride in ourselves that werewrote this value statement  so as to include our need to be enriched by others rather than ourjust offering them our  service. The human heart is so subtly prone to pride that one canexalt himself in the  very act of offering his service to another.    The point is that   Our MissionStatement   is the way God is  calling us to apply  his Word  in this place for ourgeneration. Giving our lives to  this   Mission   is our contribution to what we believeGod is doing all over  these Cities and all over the world. We believe it is tremendouslyimportant. What is it?     Six Phrases In Our Mission     I will summarize it in seven very briefBiblical observations to  clarify six phrases in the   Mission Statement,   plus aview of it whole.    Our Mission is      to spread a passion     for the Supremacy of God in all things     for the joy of all peoples.     1. The Supremacy of God.      In one of David&#146;s great prayers in 2Samuel 7:22, he says                 Thou art great, O Lord GOD; for there is none like Thee, and      there is no God besides Thee.              In other words, God is absolutely supreme.He is the greatest of  all Beings. He is the first and the last. There is none like him.He is infinite, eternal,  and unchanging in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice,goodness and truth.     And yet how important is he on television or atyour work or in  advertising or movies or sport or shopping malls. Those who graspthis Mission Statement  are stunned by the incredible neglect of God in our world. If heis supreme -- if he is  the most important reality in the universe, creating all,upholding all, governing all,  calling all to account -- then his virtual insignificance in ourculture is the most  appalling, terrifying, heart-breaking thing in the world (Jer.2:13).    In this setting, our mission is to lift abanner and blow a trumpet and  live a life called   THE SUPREMACY OF GOD.     2. In all things.      The supremacy of God   in allthings  . The  biblical root of this phrase is 1 Corinthians 10:31,           Whether, then, you eat or drink orwhatever you do, do all to    the glory of God.         Eating and drinking are representative of theordinary and mundane. The  point is this: Don&#146;t think that the supremacy of God only hasto do with worship  services or missions or Bible teaching, or things like governmentsand treaties and wars.  It has to do with Diet Coke and Bagels, with homework and flattires, with used cars and  the internet.     Our mission is to soak life with the supremacyof God. Our mission is  to bring all of life into connection with God. Our mission is toexult in the fact that  there is not a square inch of this planet, or a single moment intime over which God does  not say, Mine! Our mission is to live in the presenceof God every moment of  every day, everywhere we are and savor his supremacy there.     3. Passion.      A passion   for the supremacy ofGod in all  things. It&#146;s a risky word, especially if you put theword purple in  front of it. Which we don&#146;t. If you don&#146;t like it, thentry zeal, jealousy,  enthusiasm, fervency, ardor, earnestness. The point is to find away of getting across the  intensity of Jesus&#146; command to love the Lord your God withALL your heart and ALL  your soul and ALL your mind (Matthew 22:37). It&#146;s an effortto come to terms with  that terrible word from Jesus in Revelation 3:16.           Because you are lukewarm, and neitherhot nor cold, I will spit    you out of My mouth.         It&#146;s an attempt to capture in a word whatDavid felt when he said  in Psalm 63:1,                 O God, Thou art my God; I shall seekThee earnestly; my soul      thirsts for Thee, my flesh yearns for Thee, in a dry and wearyland where there is no      water.             Seeking earnestly, thirsting, yearning -- theseare words of passionate  desire.    Our mission is not to merely think right or actright, but to feel what  God is worthy of. Jonathan Edwards was absolutely right when hesaid that God is glorified  when men see his supremacy and understand it truly. But God ismore glorified when we not  only see it and understand it but also rejoice in it and haveemotions that correspond to  his worth (Miscellanies, #448). God is most glorified in us whenwe are most satisfied in  him.     4. For the joy.      A passion for the supremacy of God inall things   for  the joy . . .   The assumption here is that to see thesupremacy of God&#146;s  glory fills the heart with joy. But it&#146;s not a mereassumption. It&#146;s a proven  experience and, more importantly, a Biblical truth. Psalm 16:11,         In thy presence is  fullness of joy and in that right hand are     pleasures for evermore .        Or consider the logical connection betweenverses 2 and 3 of Psalm 95:                 Let us shout joyfully to Him withpsalms. 3 For the LORD is a      great God, And a great King above all gods.             Shout joyfully to God. Why? Because the Lord isa great God -- that is,   supreme  God. The supremacy of God is the ground of our joy.So God&#146;s gracious  supremacy over us satisfies our hearts, and our satisfaction inGod glorifies his  supremacy.  He  gets the glory.  We  get the joy.     5. Of all peoples.      A passion for the supremacy of God inall things for the joy   of  all peoples  . Why plural -- peoples? The point is notto reduce the  importance of individuals. Christ died for individual people.People are born again and  saved individually. The point rather is to call attention to thegreat unfinished task of  world evangelization; and that means reaching all the  peoples   of the world  and planting the church among them so that they can be aboutevangelizing their own  people.    Psalm 67:3-4 says,                 Let the   peoples   praiseThee, O God; let all the   peoples        praise Thee. 4 Let the   nations   be gladand sing for joy.             God is interested in all the peoples. He wantsto draw every people  into the joy of his supremacy: Let the nations be glad andsing for joy. This  is our understanding of finishing the great commission -- not thatevery individual will  be saved but that every people group will be penetrated with thegospel. Revelation 5:9  says that Christ                 was slain, ransomed for God with [hisown] blood people from      every tribe and tongue and people and nation.             And Jesus said in Matthew 24:14,                 This Gospel of the kingdom shall bepreached throughout the whole      world as a testimony to all the nations (or peoples) and thenthe end will come.            Our mission at Bethlehem will not be finisheduntil all the peoples  hear and the church is planted in every one. This is a hugepriority among us. World  history hangs on it.     6. To spread.     To spread  a passion for the supremacyof God in all things  for the joy of all peoples. If all these things are so -- ifGod is the supreme  reality in the universe; if he is related to all things; if hestirs a passion for his  supremacy in all who know him; if this is the source of deep andeverlasting joy; if God  means to include all the peoples -- then we cannot sit on thesethings. We cannot hoard  them. We cannot hide them. We must spread them. We exist   tospread   a passion  for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of allpeoples.     Where Is Love In Our Mission?     Which leads to one last thing. On page 3 inthe first column an  utterly crucial sentence (in the middle) says,                 The cry of the Holy Spirit in thehearts of our people is for a      fresh, decisive emphasis on  Relationships ofLove .             So we ask in closing, Where is love in Our Mission Statement ?  The answer is that  Our Mission Statement is a definition oflove.      Love is taking whatever pains arenecessary, even at the cost of  your life, to bring others into the all-satisfying everlastingenjoyment of the supremacy  of God. If you just take two words of the Mission and put themtogether, you will see  this:  Spread . . . joy.  Our Mission is to spread joy. Butthe only joy that fills  the deepest void of our hearts, and the only joy that lasts forever is joy in the  supremacy of God. If we give people everything in the world butthis, they will not thank  us in the end. What is LOVE?  To love  is to spread a passionfor the supremacy of  God in all things for the joy of all peoples.     The heartbeat of our Mission is love. Becausethe heartbeat of our  mission is joy of all peoples in supremacy of God.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
