 February 12, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor            Joy recovered    Truth #6    The benefits purchased by the death of Christ belong to those who   repent and trust him.        "Repent, then and turn to God,    so that your sins may be wiped out" (Acts 3:19).        "Believe in the Lord Jesus    and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31).        What we have really been talking about in this series is a way of   understanding the whole world and everything in it. You could call   it a Christian worldview, or a Christian philosophy of life.   Everything up to this point in the series (and in the pamphlet   "Quest for Joy") has been aimed to help a person know what it   means to become a Christian.       Becoming a Christian means recognizing that there is a great   God who created all things and all persons for his glory -- to   display the greatness and beauty and power of who he is.        Becoming a Christian means recognizing that this is why every   person exists. This is our reason for being. This is the meaning   of human life -- to reflect back to God and to reflect to each   other the glory of our Maker and all his attributes, by loving him   and trusting him and thanking him and obeying him.        Becoming a Christian means recognizing that we have all failed   to do this. We have fallen short of living for his glory. We have   exchanged it for other values we preferred, and so we have scorned   his glory. This is what the Bible calls sin. And we are all   guilty.        Becoming a Christian means recognizing that we are all   therefore condemned justly by God to eternal punishment for the   infinite guilt of dishonoring an infinitely glorious God.        And becoming a Christian means recognizing that the love of God   moved him to send his Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to provide   eternal life for helpless sinners. When Jesus died for sinners he   became our ransom, our substitute, and the vindication of God's   glory on our behalf.        Now the final question in the series is, How do you become a   Christian? How does the ransom Jesus paid become a ransom for me?   How does the substitution he made for sins become a substitute for   my sins? How does the repair he made for the injured glory of God   become a repair for the injury I have done? What must I do to be   saved?        It is a very important question. When the Philippian jailor   cried out in Acts 16:30 to Paul and Silas, "Men, what must I do to   be saved?" they did not answer, "You don't have to do anything   because you are already saved, because Jesus died for the whole   world."        That is not what they said, because that is not true. The death   of Jesus for sinners was not designed to save people apart from a   personal response. If you ask, "Did Jesus pay a ransom for   everybody in the world, and did he give himself as a substitute   for everybody in the world?", the Biblical answer is this: the   death of Christ is of infinite worth and has in it enough grace to   save every person who ever lived. It is all-sufficient in its   saving worth. But in its effective design it only saves those who   respond to the gospel offer.        The death of Jesus can be held out to any and every person in   the world with this assurance: there is grace here to cover all   your sins if you will receive it and believe in Jesus Christ.   There is a substitute for sinners here able to bear all your sins   if you will receive him and believe on him. There is a ransom here   that has paid the whole debt of all who come to Christ and   believe. All that Christ is he will be for you if you come to him   and believe in him.        God has provided a salvation for sinners. It is sufficient for   all sinners. And all are invited to come. But it does not save a   person who will not come. A personal response is absolutely   necessary. And that is what we want to talk about this morning.   What response to Jesus is necessary in order to have our sins   forgiven and in order to have eternal life? Or, as the jailor   said, "What must I do to be saved?"        There are two very big obstacles standing in the way of a right   answer to this question.        1. One obstacle is our own sinfulness. We do not want to admit   that the answer might include some deep changes of what we love.   We don't want to admit that WE might have to CHANGE. We want to   hear an answer that says we can be saved from our sins and escape   hell by just believing that Jesus died for our sins as long as   that belief does not imply any changes in my life. That's the   first obstacle to hearing a right answer to this question: our   sinfulness does not want to hear that salvation may cost us   something.        2. The other obstacle is that there are thousands of people in   the church today who are teaching that the Bible requires nothing   of us except an intellectual belief in the gospel. They are saying   that any other requirements for salvation are what the New   Testament calls "works" and that would mean that we have to earn   salvation.        So our own sinful nature and many teachers are conspiring to   hinder us today from hearing the full New Testament answer to the   question, "What must I do to be saved?". Let's let the New   Testament speak now on this matter.        First of all it is right to stress that salvation is free and   not earned. Ephesians 2:8 says, "By grace are you saved through   faith, and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God, not   of works, lest any man should boast." Let's make this very clear,   we are not saved by WORKS. This means that you cannot DO anything   to EARN salvation. You cannot do anything that you might boast in.   You cannot BUY salvation. Christ bought it for you. It is   free.        Revelation 22:17 invites sinners to be saved like this: "Let   him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of   life without price." Now notice: you cannot buy this water. It has   no price for you. It is free. But that does not mean there are no   requirements for drinking and being saved. It says, "Let him who   thirsts come . . ." Thirst is crucial. Coming is crucial. It says,   "Let him who desires, (or: "whosoever will") take the water of   life . . ." Desiring is crucial.        In other words, when the Bible says you cannot EARN salvation,   or you cannot do any WORKS to buy it, it does not mean that there   is no cost or requirement. In fact it will cost you a change in   what you are thirsty for. It will cost you a turning from the   water of death to the water of life.        The reason the Bible is so jealous not to let salvation be by   works is because that would rob God of glory in the work of   salvation. If we try to work our way to salvation it draws   attention to our strength and our value and our contribution. But   faith on the other hand throws all attention on the value and the   sufficiency of who Christ is and what Christ did. Faith glorifies   God. Works glorify us.        The root reason God will not let salvation be by works -- why   he will not let salvation be earned by our efforts -- is because   this would rob Jesus of his glory. God is trying to bring creation   back to its original purpose (Truth #1). God began by creating the   world for his glory, and he is now saving the world in a way that   restores that great purpose. So anything that diminishes his glory   in the work of salvation will not be accepted.        Paul said in Ephesians 2:8, "By GRACE are you saved through   faith." He saves by grace because grace is the cap stone of his   glory. We know this because it says in Ephesians 1:5f that he   "predestined us to be his children according to the good pleasure   of his will unto the praise of the glory of his grace." Everything   he has done in salvation is aimed at winning praise from us for   the glory of his grace.        Once you get a handle on this you realize why certain things   are required for our salvation and certain things are not. In a   word, God requires of us things that glorify his grace, and   rejects things that would glorify our self-sufficiency or glorify   sin.        Now what would that be? We have seen from Acts 16:31 that God   demands faith: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be   saved." Let's let the rest of the New Testament speak on this   matter. What does the New Testament say is the kind of response to   the gospel that will glorify God's grace?        1. Sometimes the New Testament says that we must believe THAT   certain things are true in order to be saved. John 20:31, "These   things are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ,   the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name"   (See 1 John 5:1).        2. Other times the New Testament says that we must believe IN   or ON Jesus as a person, that is, trust him and count him   faithful. John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that whoever   believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." Acts   10:43, "Everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins   through his name."        It glorifies Jesus when you believe the truth about him, and it   glorifies him when you trust him as a reliable person. Both kinds   of faith are necessary to honor the Son.        3. Acts 3:19 says, "Repent and turn again, that your sins may   be blotted out." And Jesus said in Luke 13:3, "Unless you repent,   you will all likewise perish" (See Luke 15:7,10).        Some say that if you require repentance for salvation you make   salvation depend on works. But this is not true. Repenting is not   the same as works. It means turning away from the hog pen of sin   to the banquet of grace. When the prodigal son decided to turn   away from the pig pens of the world and come home to his father's   house, his father did not make a slave out of him. He gave him a   party. Turning from the pig pen of the world to the banquet of   heaven is not works. You do have to turn from sin and come home to   God. That's repentance. It is NOT works. He didn't earn anything   by coming home. It was free. And it will be free for you too. But   if you want God, you have to let sin go. That's repentance, not   works.        4. In Matthew 18:3 Jesus says, "Truly, I say to you, unless you   turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of   heaven." This is another way of saying, "Unless one is born again,   he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3).        To enter the kingdom we must turn and become like children.   That means we must humble ourselves before God and admit that we   are helpless and that we want to trust him as our Father instead   of being proud and self-sufficient and self-confident any more.   That's what it means to turn and repent. But this is not works. In   fact it is the opposite of works. Children are people who admit   that they can't earn anything. They are helpless and dependent.   It's a requirement that we become like children in order to enter   the kingdom of God. But it is not works. You don't earn anything   by becoming a child.        5. Hebrews 5:9 says, "Christ became the source of eternal   salvation to all who obey him." And 1 Peter 4:17 says, "What will   be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?" And John   3:36 says, "He who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but   the wrath of God rests upon him."        What does this mean? It means is that the gospel comes to us   with divine authority. The only way to receive an authority is   obediently. If you don't receive it obediently, you don't receive   it at all. You reject it. And if you reject God's authority in the   Gospel, you reject the gospel, and cannot be saved. The only way   to glorify the authority of God's grace is by an obedient   spirit.        We can see this in another text too, because it's what Jesus   meant when he called people to take up their cross and FOLLOW   HIM.        6. In Mark 8:34 he said, "If any man would come after me, let   him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever   would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for   my sake and the gospel's will save it."        Here the requirement for saving our lives is losing our lives,   which means denying ourselves, dying to ourselves, and following   Jesus. Is this works? Are we working for God when we die to self?   No. Letting the old proud self die is not works. It's the death of   works. That's who's dying. The old sin-loving, self-exalting,   God-opposing me has to die. When that old rebel dies, I don't earn   anything. Nobody boasts in having to be put to death on a cross.   You don't earn anything by getting crucified. This is not works,   but it is change -- the deepest and most profound change   possible.        And the same thing goes for "following Jesus". Following Jesus   is required, but it is not works. Following Jesus is no more   working for Jesus than the pigeons of Elliot Park are working for   me when they follow me around because I have the bread crumbs they   want.        Following Jesus would be working for our salvation if we were   following him to meet his need and not for ours. But the whole   point of Mark 8:34ff is this: if you lose your life you will save   it. If you die you live. If you forfeit you gain.        Jesus demands that we follow him not because he needs our labor   but because we need his love and fellowship and help. He's the   doctor and we are the patients. This is what he said in Mark 2:17,   "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are   sick. I came not to call the righteous but sinners." When we obey   the call of Jesus to follow, we are not coming to an employer to   earn wages; we are coming to a doctor to get healing. And that is   not works. The gospel is not a "help wanted" sign; it's a "help   available" sign. Coming to one would be works. Coming to the other   is faith.        Faith means coming to Jesus to have all our needs met and to   have all our longings satisfied. "I am the bread of life, he who   comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall   never thirst" (John 6:35).        Once you see the essence of faith as a coming to Jesus in order   to be satisfied with all that he is, then you begin to see that   all these other requirements are really just different ways of   describing the demand for faith.        So that is the one thing that I call upon you all to do this   morning -- to turn to Jesus in faith. To believe that all that he   is, is all that you need. To say to him in your heart,        "You hold the key to truth and knowledge;    - You hold the key to forgiveness and acceptance with God;    - You hold the key to hope and eternal life;    - You hold the key to a life of meaning and purpose;    - You hold the key to righteousness and peace.        So I come to You.    I take You for all that You are.    I forsake all others and cleave to You alone as my Saviour and   Lord.        And I thank You and praise Your name;    that You have loved me and offered me    all that You are for my everlasting joy. Amen."                * * * * * * * *        See also the requirements in these texts    Hebrews 7:25 "He is able for all time to save those who draw near   to God through him."    John 1:12, "To as many as received him, to them gave he power to   become the sons of God."    John 10:9, "I am the door; if anyone enters by me, he will be   saved."    John 6:35, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not   hunger." John 4:14, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give   him will never thirst."    Luke 14:33, "Whoever of you does not renounce all that he has   cannot be my disciple." (See Luke 10:28, "Do this and you will   live.")    Romans 10:9, "If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and   believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will   be saved."
