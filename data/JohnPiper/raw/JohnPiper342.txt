 February 2, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       SAVORING GOD by SERVING THE SAINTS    (Hebrews 6:9-12)         Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved,      we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation. For God      is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which      you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.      And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in      realizing the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you      may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith      and patience inherit the promises.         The reason I chose this text for this morning's message is that   during the pastors' conference that ended Wednesday Sam Storms   built his message on it and moved me deeply. One of the reasons it   leaped out so powerfully is that I am always on the alert for   texts that explicitly connect God-centeredness and the ministry to   people. Too often we feel forced to choose between these two:   either we will be God-focussed and sensitivity to people and their   needs will suffer; or we will be people-focussed and God will be   used rather than worshipped.        Satan surely wants us to feel that this is an either/or. He   probably doesn't care which way we go: God-focussed and uncaring   about people; or people-focussed and not enthralled by God. Just   so we don't keep these together.        Do you remember the time the Pharisees came to Jesus and asked   which was the great commandment in the law? Jesus answered in a   way that frustrates Satan's design to put asunder what God had   joined together. He said the great commandment is "You shall love   the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and   with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment." I   wonder if Jesus paused just then to see how they were hearing him.   And perhaps noticing a sense of self-satisfaction in this group of   religious zealots, he says, "And a second is like it (note this:   like it): You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two   commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew   22:37-40).        Jesus keeps together what Satan wants to separate:   God-centeredness and serving others. Love God, Love God, Love   God--with all that you are, heart soul and mind. This cannot be   reduced to loving people. If it could, the second commandment   would be unnecessary. The first commandment is not the second   commandment. The second is like it. Together they sum up all the   law and the prophets. Loving God and loving people are not the   same.        A great tragedy in many churches is that savoring God collapses   into serving people. It is a subtle danger because it looks so   good at first. And Jesus said, If you do it unto one of the least   of these my brethren you do it unto me (Matthew 25:40). In many   churches this text has become a kind of fog where the hallowing of   God's name evaporates into humanitarianism. Devotion toward God   dissolves into attempts to do good for others.        And the tragedy is just as great in churches where a focus on   God and scripture fails to yield the fruit of love for people. A   form of worship replaces a faithful witness. Study of God's power   replaces serving God's people. Prayer replaces active compassion.   It seems almost impossible. But it happens. Our hearts are   unbelievably capable of boasting in doctrines of humility and   putting asunder what God has joined: worship and witness;   hallowing God's name and helping God's people; savoring God's   glory and serving the saints.        I want to avoid that in my life and I want us to avoid it as a   church. One of the ways to avoid it is to see a clear statement   from the Bible about how these things are related and to get the   structure of the relationship fixed in our minds. We need to have   our minds transformed by the structure of Hebrews 6:10 so they   will not be conformed to this age and its mindset about loving God   and serving people.        Hebrews 6:10 says, "God is not unjust so as to overlook (or:   forget) your work and the love which you showed for his sake   (literally: toward his name) in serving the saints, as you still   do."        To see how profound and helpful this verse is for us we need to   see four things: two things about God, and two things about   us.        First, it talks about God's memory: God will not forget your   work and your love for his name. He will remember.        Second, it talks about God's justice. His memory of our work   and love is based on his justice: "God is not unjust so as to   forget your work and love..." That means that he is just so as to   remember your work and love. So his memory of your works of love   is based on his justice.        Third, it talks about our service toward the saints: "serving   the saints, as you still do." You have served them in the past and   you are still serving them. This is Christians in the church   having an eye to caring for each other and meeting each other's   needs.        Fourth, it talks about the love we have shown toward the name   of God. The RSV "love which you have showed for his sake" is   literally, "love which you showed toward his name." So don't mix   up the service to the saints in the last part of the verse, and   the love to the name of God in the middle of the verse. They are   not identical.        So there are four things to see: God's memory, God's justice,   our service to the saints and our love toward the name of God. Now   how do those four things relate to each other? Can this verse show   us the way God means for those things to interconnect so that we   will be protected from confusing them or neglecting them or   interchanging them or letting one thing get lost in another thing?   Can we let the interrelationships of this verse renew and   transform our minds so that the very framework and form of our   thinking will be like God's word and not man's? That's our   goal.        So let's ask two questions:        1. What is the relationship between serving the saints and   showing love to the name of God?        2. What is the relationship between God's memory of these   things and his justice? Why is it a matter of divine justice that   our work of serving the saints be remembered?        First, What is the relationship between serving the saints and   showing love to the name of God?        The text says, ". . . the work and love which you showed toward   &#91;God's&#93; name, having served the saints and are still   serving." Virtually all the translations agree that the   relationship here is between the end you are pursuing and the way   that you go about pursuing it. The end pursued is showing love to   God's name, and the way to go about pursuing it is to serve the   saints.        O how easy it would be here to make a fatal mistake. We can   imagine someone--or a whole ministry--saying: "See! Love for the   name of God is virtually equivalent to loving people." And so what   really matters is caring about people. And so they give all their   energies there, and hallowing God's name evaporates into religious   humanitarianism. God ceases to be worshipped and he begins to be   used.        But this is NOT what the text says. It says that God will   remember our love shown to his name. This is the focus of God's   memory. "He is not unjust so as to forget our work and love toward   his name." The love he remembers is toward his name. It is   Godward. It is God-focussed. Yes it comes to expression in service   to the saints. But it does not evaporate in service to the saints.   It is alive and vital in that service. It shapes it and carries it   and sustains it. But the service is for the sake of the name not   vice versa.        But how does loving the name of God work itself out in serving   the saints? Is this love for God's name a desire to see his name   glorified so that we are motivated to serve in a way that   glorifies his name? Or is this love for God's name a delight in   his name, a getting strength from and being satisfied with his   name so that we are sustained in serving by this delight and   strength and satisfaction that we have in God?        The answer is surely: both. Jesus said, "Whoever gives to one   of these little ones (=saints) even a cup of cold water because he   is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward"   (Matthew 10:42). That is, God will remember him. God is not unjust   to forget such a deed done to a saint because he is a   disciple--because he bears the name of Christ. This is one example   of how love toward the name moves a person to serve the   saints.        Another is 1 peter 4:11, "Let him who serves serve in the   strength which God supplies so that in everything God will get the   glory." Here the serving of the saints flows from our getting   strength and joy from God to sustain our serving. So love to God's   name means looking to God for satisfaction that can be shared with   the saints in service.        Now these two ways of relating love toward the name of God and   service toward the saints are not at odds. One says that the goal   of serving the saints is that the name of God be glorified. The   other says that the ground (the spring) of serving the saints is   that the name of God be trusted and enjoyed. In one case loving   the name of God means desiring for his name to be glorified. In   the other case loving the name of God means delighting in the   glory we've already seen. But both come from the same heart of   love to God. One stresses the longing and desiring and yearning   for God to be known and honored and loved. The other stresses the   resting and delighting and satisfaction that he is already known   and honored and loved. They are not two different loves. It is the   way everyone who loves the name of God experiences him.        In both cases serving the saints--caring and loving and helping   and encouraging and supporting the saints--is the way we show our   love for the name of God.        Now the other question is how does God's justice relate to his   memory of our love for his name and our serving the saints? Why is   it a matter of divine justice that our work of serving the saints   for the sake of God's name be remembered?        Let me put this weighty matter very briefly, and then close   with a practical encouragement. First a wrong answer, and a very   dangerous one, it would go like this: justice means a day's wage   for a day's work. We put in a day's work serving the saints, and   God is obliged to give us a day's wage for that service. It's a   matter of justice. In other words, we obligate God by calling   attention to the worth of our service.        But that is not where the text points. The text says that "God   is not unjust to forget our work and love toward his name." What   obliges the justice of God to remember our love is not the worth   of our service, but the worth of his name. When we serve and work   out of love for that name, what we are calling attention to is the   worth of his name. This is why the justice of God is at stake in   remembering our work and love.        Listen to this parallel from Psalm 143:11.         For thy name's sake, O Lord, preserve my life!       In thy justice bring me out of trouble!         God's acting for his name's sake and his acting out of justice   are the same. When we serve the saints as a way of loving the name   of God, God's justice commits him to remember our work and reward   us for his name's sake (cf. 10:35; 11:26).        Now there is a great encouragement for us here. We long for   Bethlehem to become more and more a church where the saints serve   each other--care for each other, help each other, encourage each   other, endure each other, restore each other. We also aspire to be   a very God-centered church--a church where everything is done out   of love for the name of God. What this text says is that this   combination is the secret of great blessing. The point is to   encourage us that when we serve and keep on serving, even in the   small and seemingly unnoticed ways, God will never forget. Every   note you write, every call you make, every visit, every gift,   every late night conversation, every turning the other cheek,   every unrequited kindness, every service out of love for his name   God sees and he will not forget them to all eternity.        So let us love the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and   strength, and for sake of his name let us serve one another! He   will not forget. His justice guarantees it.
