 April 19, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       THE INVINCIBLE PURPOSE OF GOD:    FOUNDATIONS FOR FULL ASSURANCE    "Christ (and Those in Him) Will Never Die Again    (Romans 6:1-11)         What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin      that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin      still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been      baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We      were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that      as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,      we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been      united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be      united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our      old self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might      be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For he      who has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with      Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we      know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die      again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died      he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to      God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive      to God in Christ Jesus.                I want to begin with a confession this morning. The confession   is this: I have a very strong nostalgic attachment to the word   "existentialism."        The reason I say it's a nostalgic attachment is because it was   part of the air that we adolescents breathed in the 1960's--along   with Viet Nam and the Beatles and Sony and Cher and Peter Paul and   Mary and the Mamas and the Papas and Dylan Thomas and John F.   Kennedy and Civil Rights and Martin Luther King and John Steinbeck   and Ernest Hemingway and Robert Frost and Carl Sandberg and Neil   Armstrong and Hippies and Haight Ashbury and LSD and Jesus People   and Cassius Clay and C.S. Lewis and the death of God. To mention a   few things that we breathed in those days.        I turned 14 in 1960 and I turned 24 in 1970. Those are pretty   tumultuous years in a young man's life--14 to 24. Puberty,   pimples, high school, college, marriage, seminary--it all happened   in the sixties. And pervading the air we breathed in the sixties   was this almost undefinable thing "existentialism."        As a full blown world view it was godless and hopeless. Albert   Camus put it in the drama of the absurd, and Jean Paul Sartre put   it in novels, and Martin Heidegger put it in huge books on   philosophy. There is no God. There is no final ultimate meaning to   life or to the universe. There is no fixed value or standard to   live by. There is only raw existence and radical, rootless   freedom. Life is absurd.        Meaning isn't shaped by any given essence in here or out there.   It is created out of nothingness individually, moment by moment by   whatever you do with your existence--hence the name   "existentialism." What's real is what you make real by the use you   make of your existence.        But in the sixties that hopeless, empty world view had not yet   produced the orgies of sexual license in the seventies or the   avalanche of self-ism in the eighties. In the sixties there were   still some pretty strong winds of moral vision blowing. We could   still sing, "The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind. The   answer is blowin' in the wind."        And for thousands of us we heard the answer in the gospel of   Jesus Christ the Son of God, who lived and loved like nobody had   ever lived before or since; who chose suffering and death to bear   the sins of others; who rose from the dead to give hope beyond the   futility of this life; and who fills his people with his Spirit   today to help them live the way he did and bring them to   everlasting life and joy.        Some of us heard this answer in the books of C.S. Lewis, some   in the echoes of Soren Kierkegaard, some from Dietrich Bonhoeffer,   some in the voice of Martin Luther King, some from a thousand   unknown kids with long hair and beads and sandals and a Bible   somewhere between San Fancisco and Kabul, Afghanistan.        And one thing these messengers had in common was the spirit of   existentialism--not the hopeless world view, but the spirit of   radical, passionate existence--the spirit that life without   passion and risk and commitment is phony--no matter how objective   and real it is, no matter how provable and certain and orderly it   is--life is phony if we don't throw ourselves into it with passion   and risk.        Kierkegaard threw all his existential weight against the dead   orthodoxy of the church of Denmark where faith was simply a   yawning yes, yes to creeds and baptisms and confirmations and   ceremonies. I remember reading his book  Purity of Heart is to   Will One Thing , and feeling like I was on top of a high   mountain with no clouds. Chad Walsh called it shock therapy.        Bonhoeffer led the confessing church in Germany against the   compromises with the Third Reich and paid with the cost of his   life. So thousands of us read his book,  The Cost of   Discipleship  and  Letters and Papers from Prison  with   a sense of existential passion that we felt for few other   books.        And even C.S. Lewis, speaking from the very center of the   literary establishment at Cambridge, had the aroma of   existentialism when he said things like, "The salvation of a   single soul is more important than the production or preservation   of all the epics and tragedies in the world." 1         My confession is that I grew from a boy to a man in the   atmosphere of existentialism--in an atmosphere that said, "If you   are going to play games with your religion, or if you are going to   play games with your academic career, don't play them around me.   Because the only faith I admire is a real, heartfelt, risk-taking,   life-changing, existential faith. And the only academic labors I   admire are ones that are driven by a passion for truth and love   and God and eternal life.        I really mean it when I say this is a confession. Because I am   at least partly aware of the sinful downside of growing up in this   atmosphere of existentialism. For one thing, I am not very patient   with status quo Christianity--when people in the name of Christ   use their money and their vocations and leisure pretty much like   the rest of the world. But impatience is not a virtue. The anger I   feel at sham and hypocrisy too easily swallows up compassion for   the weak and patience for people in process. There is no point in   a pastor trying to hide these things. That's where I struggle and   that is where you need to pray. There are scars, as well as   strengths, left from the sixties.        * * *        But now what in the world does all this have to do with Easter   Sunday morning and the resurrection of Jesus from the dead? I'll   try to show you.        I see four breathtaking facts about resurrection from the dead   in this text. And we are not talking here about reincarnation or   about escape from the body or about ghosts or spirits or anything   like that. We are talking about Christ's body and soul and spirit   as a unified whole person coming out of the grave and some day his   people following him in exactly the same way.        Here are the four facts: 1) Verse 4: "Christ was raised from   the dead by the glory of the Father." 2) Verse 9: "Christ being   raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has   dominion over him." 3) Verse 8: "We have died with Christ"--those   who trust in Christ are united with him (Col. 2:12; Gal. 3:26).   When we trust Christ we are identified with him so that what   happened to him, happens to us. Our faith is expressed in baptism:   we are buried with him in baptism (v. 2); we died with him. 4)   Verse 5: "If we have been united with him in a death like his, we   shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his." We   too shall rise. And we will rise like him--never to die again.   Death has no dominion over us.        1. Christ rose from the dead.        2. Christ will never die again. He reigns triumphant over   death.        3. Through faith we are united to Christ and die in him.        4. We shall rise like he rose and live with him for ever.        As I have read over those stunning facts for weeks, the   Biblical realist in me said, "There are some really good arguments   to give on Sunday morning for why you all should believe these   four things." And then the existentialist in me said, "Yes, but a   sermon is very short, and what if they hear those arguments and   say, "That's an interesting religion. Thanks for a stimulating   sermon. Now off to Easter Sunday dinner."        And I felt a tremendous longing that this morning be an   existential encounter with these realities rather than a merely   intellectual awareness of them. There's that word again and why it   matters so much this morning.        The difference is this. Suppose you are sitting in your kitchen   listening to the news one evening just before supper and you hear   on the radio that last year in Minnesota 30 children playing near   the street were killed by motorists. You hear it and you may wince   and say, "What a tragedy. That must be hard for those parents."   Then you go on to the next news item.        But then suddenly the front door bursts open and your 12   year-old son comes screaming into the house with the news that   your nine year-old son has just been hit by a car that swerved   over the curb and cut him down on the sidewalk. Now this piece of   news is different.        The first piece of news was true. You didn't doubt it. There   was good evidence for it. It could probably be proved. But now   here was a piece of news that goes to the core of your being. It   shakes you. Everything in you comes alive to this reality that   it's your son. It touches your existence. It will change   everything in your life. It will break your heart. It will shatter   things in you more deeply than you have ever been touched.        As I read these four great facts: Christ is risen from the   dead; Christ will never die again; I have died with Christ; and I   shall be raised like him to live with him for ever--when I read   those again and again, I longed for you who are here today not to   hear them as merely provable reports of some religious claims, but   as the cry of your child bursting through the door. "It has to do   with you! This is your death and your life and your hope."        And I remembered the story I read recently about a Ukranian   rabbi Levi-Yitzhak. He was confronted by an atheist philosopher   who rattled off a list of arguments against the existence of God   thinking that the rabbi would take up the intellectual challenge,   which he could have easily done. But the rabbi did it differently   than the philosopher expected. He simply looked him directly in   the eye and said gently, "And what if, after all, it were true   that God exists? Tell me, and what if it were true?"        By the grace of God that became an existential moment for the   philosopher. He was shaken. These words troubled him more than all   the arguments he had heard. He came to feel for the first time how   vulnerable and accountable he was before the living God. There was   no more time for playing intellectual games. His whole world was   turned on end and he was opened to the truth and was persuaded and   became a believer.        So that's what I want to ask you this morning: What if it's   true that Christ rose from the dead; that he will never die again   and death has no dominion over him so that he is the Lord of the   universe; that by faith we are united to him in his death and rise   with him to live for ever? What if it is true--not just like radio   facts out there somewhere, but like the truth as heard in the   mouth of a screaming child that suddenly, in a moment, changes   everything?        Let me just get you started from the Bible:         If it's True, ...                ...the power of death is broken, and the root of bondage,      the fear of death is severed and we can be freed.              ...you don't need to get to the top in order to get to be a      success.              ...you don't need to run away from trouble and live in fear      that he who has the most toys wins.              ...you can rejoice in persecution for righteousness sake      for great is your reward in heaven.              ...every loss you endured for the kingdom will be made up      to you a thousand-fold.              ...there is no ultimate risk in the cause of truth and      love; nothing can defeat you.              ...the decay of your body is prelude to glory.              ...you will be made completely whole with no impurity and      no struggle with lust or greed or covetousness or fear or      inferiority or cowardice or painful memories or paralyzing      shame.              ...there will be no mourning or crying or tears or pain for      the former things will pass away.              ...swords will be turned into plowshares and spears into      pruning hooks and war will be no more.              ...every injustice will be rectified and every evil will be      recompensed and every wrong made right.              ...and those who are in Christ will rise with him never to      die again, and God will be our God and we will be his people,      and the glory of the Lord will be our light and our joy for      ever.            The witness of God in Scripture, the witness of all the martyrs   and all the people of God for two thousand years is that these   things are indeed so. 2   Let your response be a life of   faith and love and joy and praise.                              1 C.
