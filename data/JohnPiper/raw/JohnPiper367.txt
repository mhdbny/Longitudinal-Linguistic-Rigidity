 December 27, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       A YEAR-END LOOK AT JESUS CHRIST    (Revelation 1:9-20)         I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the      tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus,      was on the island called Patmos, because of the word of God and      the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,      and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet,      saying, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven      churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to      Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."      And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And      having turned I saw seven golden lamp stands; and in the middle      of the lamp stands one like a son of man, clothed in a robe      reaching to the feet, and girded across His breast with a      golden girdle. And His head and His hair were white like white      wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and      His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been caused to      glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many      waters. And in His right hand He held seven stars; and out of      His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like      the sun shining in its strength. And when I saw Him, I fell at      His feet as a dead man. And He laid His right hand upon me,      saying, "Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, and the      living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore,      and I have the keys of death and of Hades. "Write therefore the      things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the      things which shall take place after these things. As for the      mystery of the seven stars which you say in My right hand, and      the seven golden lamp stands: the seven stars are the angels of      the seven churches, and the seven lamp stands are the seven      churches."                One of the most important principles that guides the way I   preach and what I preach comes from 2 Corinthians 3:18. It says,   "We all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of   the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to   glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit." The principle is this:   true gospel change of a person's character comes from steady   gazing at the glory of Jesus. "Beholding the glory of the Lord, we   are being transformed into his image." We become like what we   treasure enough to spend time focussing on. Some say, "Seeing is   believing." This text says, "Seeing is becoming." You become like   what you behold.        The implication of this for preaching is that, if I aim for us   as a church to be transformed from one degree of glory to   another--to become more and more like Jesus, then I should hold up   Jesus again and again for you to gaze at.        There are things about Christ that we need very much at the end   of this year.               We need the perseverance of Christ in the face of      affliction.              We need the energy and strength of Christ in the face of      depleting pressures.              We need the wisdom of Christ in the face of complexities of      life and ministry.              We need the stability of Christ in the midst of rapid      social and political and personal changes all around us.              We need the assurance of his sovereign authority in a      culture sliding farther and farther from his truth.            It is no exaggeration to say that we need Christ present to our   view and for our fellowship more than we need anything else. 1   John 3:2 says, "Beloved, we are God's children now. It does not   yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he appears we   shall be like him for we shall see him as he is." To the degree   that we can see him now, we are changed into his image. When he   comes to be seen in his full glory, our transforming will be   completed. And it all happens because of seeing him--gazing   steadily at Him.        Our needs here at the end of 1992 are not primarily financial,   but primarily spiritual. We need to be the kind of people that   radiate the beauty and truth and value of Christ. We need to be   like lights shining in a dark place. Which means we need to behold   Jesus. We need to gaze at Christ.        So I want us to take a year-end look at Christ from Revelation   1. I want us to linger for a while with our gaze simply fixed on   this Jesus.        According to verse 9b John was exiled on the island of Patmos   "because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus." Jesus was   so real and so precious to John that he would rather be exiled to   a barren island than not to talk about Christ. John had gazed at   Jesus long enough to become like him in this way: obedient   fellowship was more important than the comforts of life.        But now on the island God gives John another remarkable chance   to gaze at Jesus. He gives him a vision. And he does this not just   for John but for the seven churches of Asia and for us. In verse   10 John says that he was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day. That   means that on one of his Sunday's on the island he was deeply in   tune with the Spirit of God. So much so that suddenly (v. 10) he   "heard behind &#91;him&#93; a loud voice like the sound of a   trumpet."        The voice says in v. 11, "Write in a book what you see, and   send it to the seven churches." This means that the vision John is   about to get is meant not just for him but for us as well. And the   point of writing it down is to transmit to us the same kind of   experience of seeing Jesus that he had.        This is not easy to do--"write what you see." It is easy to   write words that you hear. But it is not easy to write in words   glorious things that you see with your eyes. But it is possible,   because Jesus said to do it. Jesus does not intend to come to each   of the seven churches the way he came to John. He could have   appeared to each congregation with this same vision. But he   doesn't. He appears to John and says, "Write in a book what you   see, and send it to the seven churches." John gets the vision. We   get the book.        But this is not because Christ wants to be distant and   impersonal with his churches. It is because he wants to come to us   in and through his word. He wants us to seek him in his word, and   know him by his word, and gaze upon him steadily through his word.   And when we do the Lord stands forth from his word in ways beyond   the merely rational and intellectual possibilities of reading.        The primary way of gazing on Christ today is through his word.   That is the clear implication of these words in verse 11, "Write   in a book what you see and send it to the . . . churches." Why   else write in a book what he saw except to transmit to the readers   some of that same experience. That is what I want us to have this   morning.        So lets look at what John saw when Christ came and revealed   himself.        Verse 12: John turns to see whose voice was like a trumpet (v.   10). And what he saw was seven golden lamp stands and Christ in   the midst of them. Notice verse 20 for an interpretation of the   lamp stands: "As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw   in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands: the seven   stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamp   stands are the seven churches."        So the vision of Jesus that John gets is him among the   churches. Christ is standing among the churches. He is not merely   over the churches. He is not distant from the churches. He is in   the middle of them. Verse 12b-13a: "I saw seven golden lamp   stands; and in the middle of the lamp stands one like a son of   man."        Here we can see how our reading is meant to be so much more   than a mere remembering of something that happened to John a long   time ago. He begins the record of his vision by telling us that   the Christ we are about to look at is in our midst. He is among   the churches. He is not far away in time or space. He moves among   his lamp stands, trimming the wicks and carving wax, breathing   life back into flickering flames.        Bethlehem is one of his lamp stands. Jesus is here this   morning. He is eager to see us burn with the light of his own   countenance. And so he bids us look at what John saw.        John saw (according to v. 13) "one like a son of man." "Son of   Man" was Jesus' favorite title for himself when he was on the   earth. You might think it refers merely to his humanity, and so is   only a title of humility. But in fact it was probably that, plus a   lot more, because of its use in Daniel 7:13-14. In Daniel the term   "son of man" or "one like a son of man" refers to a great   ruler.        I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of   heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the   Ancient of Days &#91;God the Father&#93; and was presented before   him. And to him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all   peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is   an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his   kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.        So when John says that he saw "one like a son of man" standing   in the middle of the lamp stands, he means that he saw someone   with dominion and glory and kingly power with authority over all   the nations and over all the peoples and who would rule the world   forever and ever because his kingdom could not be destroyed.        The one who stands among the churches and trims our wicks and   fans our flames is the one who received from the Ancient of Days   dominion and glory and kingdom over all rule and power and   authority in heaven and on earth. We need to see this today, just   like the seven churches needed to hear it in John's day. It is   "the son of man" who walks among the lamps stands. And that means   one with everlasting dominion whose kingdom cannot be destroyed.   We must renew this eternal focus and assurance again and again in   the midst of the adversities and the allurements of life.        The next thing John saw (in v. 13) was that this son of man was   "clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His   breast with a golden girdle." The word translated "robe reaching   to the feet" is not used anywhere else in the New Testament, but   in the Old Testament it almost always refers to the robe of the   high priest. And the gold band across his chest shows two things:   the fact that it is high--not around the waist but around the   chest--and the fact that it is gold, show that the priesthood that   he holds is very great.        Jesus is not only the son of man from Daniel 7 who receives   everlasting dominion over all nations; he is also the final high   priest who brings all the priestly work of the temple to an end.   There is no more need for animal sacrifices with all their   priestly labors. Verse 5 says Christ "released us from our sins by   his blood." This priest is so great that he gave his own blood   once for all at the end of the age to put away sin once for all by   the sacrifice of himself.        He stands among the lamp stands--he stands here by us today--as   one with authority and everlasting dominion and one with final,   decisive forgiveness for our sins.        Then John sees (v. 14) that "his head and his hair were white   as white wool, like snow." This is remarkable, because in that   same chapter in Daniel where John gets this picture of "one like a   son of man" (v. 13-14), God the Father is described like this in   verse 9, "The Ancient of Days took his seat; his vesture was like   white snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool." In other   words John is describing the Son of Man in terms used for God   himself.        I think John wants us to see something here about the age of   Christ and the wisdom and dignity that come with age--everlasting   age!        In American culture today, we respect the process of aging less   and less. A person is admired if he can keep looking young, not if   he has the dignity of age. The Bible saw it another way. Proverbs   16:31 says, "A white head is a crown of glory." So much so that in   the law God commanded, "You will rise up before the white head,   and honor the face of an old man, and you shall fear your God; I   am the Lord" (Leviticus 19:32).        One of the reasons we don't want to grow old, is that we   associate age with the fading of powers that make life worth   living--the capacity to see and hear and think clearly and move   about and not have pain. But all of those things do not belong to   aging as aging. They belong to aging in a futile and fallen world   of sin. Once God does away with sin and the curse, and establishes   the new heavens and the new earth, aging will not have any of   these negative connotations. It will only be associated with   growing wisdom and insight and maturity. All the strength will   still be there. All the mental powers. All the sight and hearing   and agility. Nothing that is great about youth will be left   behind. There will only be added all the powers and beauties and   depth of age.        This is what John saw in Jesus. He was like the Ancient of Days   with all the wisdom of eternity and all the maturity and   steadiness age, but he was not weak or weary or faltering in his   step.        Put this picture together with the next thing John saw at the   end of verse 14, "His eyes were like a flame of fire." The eyes of   this son of man are not the clouded eye of fading glory. They are   eyes of sharpest clarity. They miss nothing that happens in the   universe. And they are exploding with energy.        We all know the drooping eye that is about to go to sleep or is   sullen and half shut with scowl or a bad mood. And we know the eye   that is alive with wonder and excitement and hope and expectancy   and energy. Jesus's eyes were like a flaming fire. What we see   then is hair as white as snow and eyes like fire--wisdom and   maturity like the ancient of days together with the energy and   vitality and zeal of youth--like a bridegroom coming out of his   chamber with strength and hope, and yet with the depth and   ripening of many many years of life and marriage.        When you gaze upon Jesus at the end of 1992, remember he is not   tired or careworn or burned out or fatigued. In stead his eyes are   aflame with the flashing fire of inexhaustible energy and hope.   When Jesus thinks about his plans for you and for Bethlehem and   for America and for all the nations of the world in 1993 he is not   hesitant or wearied or bored. His eyes are a flame of fire with   utter exhilaration and passion and relish for the work he intends   to do as another year's pieces are put in place for the   consummation of history.        There is more. So much more to what John saw. Always more that   we have not seen in Jesus. There are the bronze feet and the voice   like the sound of many waters and a right hand with seven stars   and a sharp sword coming out of his mouth and his face shining in   like the sun in full strength. And there is John's reaction and   Jesus' reaction to John's reaction.        This is what we will look at as the last act together Thursday   night as we take communion and enter the new year.        But this morning gaze on this: He is among the lamp stands--the   churches--as the son of man, the one with power over the nations   and with everlasting dominion and glory. He is the great high   priest that has put away the sins of his people once and for all.   He is as aged and wise and mature as the great white-crowned   Ancient of Days, yet with eyes that are aflame with the fire of   youth and energy and hope and exhilaration for his unstoppable   plans for you and for this church and for the world.        Gaze upon Jesus in the last days of 1992 and let his royal   power and his priestly forgiveness and his ancient wisdom and his   fiery hope fill you with confidence afresh that 1992 has not been   in vain, and that 1993 will be the appointed brush-stroke on the   canvass of your life and on the canvass of history till the great   mosaic of God's work is done.
