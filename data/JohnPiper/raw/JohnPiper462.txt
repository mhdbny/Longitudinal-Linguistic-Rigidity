    December 24, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Son of Man Did Not Come    to Be served but to Serve (Part 2)   (Mark 10:45)           For even the Son of Man did not come tobe served, but to serve,    and to give His life a ransom for many.         Introduction and Review: Don&#146;tServe Jesus     Last week we focused on the spectaculartruth about the coming of  the Son of Man -- that he came NOT to be served, but to serve. Thereason this is so  important to see is that in the preceding verses Jesus had justlaid some radical  expectations on his disciples. He had told James and John thatthey would be required to  drink the cup of his suffering (v. 39), and he had told the otherten disciples that, if  they want to be great in the kingdom, they must become servant ofall (v.44). So he is  expecting them to be radically different from the way humansordinarily act. They are to  serve each other and all people, even non-Christians, and in thatservice drink the cup of  whatever suffering it will cost. And it will cost.    Now if that were the only message ofChristianity it would not be good  news. There would be no gospel. I need more than for someone totell me what I should do  and should be. I need help to be that and do that. This is whyJesus says what he says in  verse 45. The Son of Man did not come to be served but toserve. What a  horrendous mistake it would be if we heard Jesus&#146; call to bethe servant of all in  verse 44 as a call to serve him. It is not.    It is a call to learn how to be served by him.Don&#146;t miss this.  This is the heart of Christianity. This is what sets our faith offfrom all other major  religions. Our God does not need our service, nor is he glorifiedby recruits who want to  help him out. Our God is so full and so self-sufficient and sooverflowing in power and  life and joy, that he glorifies himself by serving us.    He does this by taking on a human nature andseeking us out and then  telling us that he did NOT come to get our service, but to be ourservant. In other words,  he is saying that the demand that we be servants and that we drinkthe cup of suffering in  service -- that demand is where he wants to serve us.     Here is a general truth I give you to ponderand believe: every time  Jesus commands something for us to do, it is his way of telling ushow he wants to serve  us. Let me say it another way: The path of obedience is the placewhere Christ meets us as  our servant to carry our burdens and give us his power. When youbecome a Christian -- a  disciple of Jesus -- you do not become his helper. He becomes yourhelper. You do not  become his benefactor. He becomes your benefactor. You do notbecome his servant. He  becomes your servant. Jesus does not need your help, he commandsyour obedience and offers  his help.    This is why becoming a Christian is a humblingthing. We admit that we  need help. And we turn to Christ and say, I can&#146;t be ordo what I know I am  supposed to be and do. I am desperate. I need something way beyondwhat is inside of me or  in any other ordinary person. I need you. I turn to you. I havenothing to offer in trade  or purchase. I trust you to show me mercy. I trust you to be myservant.    When we do that, when we submit to him in thatway, Christ becomes our  servant. And when he does, all of his other radical commands areno longer things we do  for him, but things he enables us to do for others. The Christianlife is a life of  serving others in the strength that he supplies as our servant. Itis loving others with  the love he gives us as our servant. It is sacrificing andsuffering with the hope and joy  and patience that he gives us as our servant.     Christian living is walking in the shadow ofour servant King. It is  making sure that we stay in the path where he loves to serve hispeople -- the path of  faith and love.    I know that the apostle Paul called himself theservant of Jesus  Christ (Romans 1:1). This is not a contradiction of whatJesus is teaching here in  Mark 10:45. Jesus himself called us his servants in othercontexts: The servant is  not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than hethat sent him  (John 13:16). The idea of servant is being used in two differentways. We are the servants  of Jesus in that we submit to his authority and his right to tellus to do whatever he  pleases. But we are not his servants in the sense that he needsour help and that his  enterprise in the world is sustained by our energy. He is not ourservant in the sense  that we command him how to live. He is our servant in the sensethat he uses all his  divine resources to help us and strengthen us and guide us andsupport us and provide our  needs.     Acts 17:25 shows what is bad aboutserving God:           He is not served by human hands, asthough he needed anything,    since he himself gives to all men life and breath andeverything.        In other words God does not want to be servedin any way that implies  we are supplying his need or supporting him or offering himsomething that he does not  already own by right.     Therefore we simply cannot negotiate with God.We have nothing of value  that is not already his by right. We cannot service him. His carnever breaks down. It  never runs out of gas. It never gets dirty. He never gets tired.He never gets depressed.  He never gets caught in traffic so that he can&#146;t get to wherehe wants to go. He  never gets lonely. He never gets hungry.     In other words, if you want what Jesus has togive, you can&#146;t buy  it. You can&#146;t trade for it. You can&#146;t work for it. Healready owns your money  and your everything you have. And when you work, it is onlybecause he has given you life  and breath and everything. All we can do is submit to hisspectacular offer to be our  Servant. And this submission is called faith -- a willingness tolet him be God. Trust him  to be the Supplier, the Strengthener, the Counselor, the Guide,the Savior. And being  satisfied with that -- with all that God is for us in Jesus.That&#146;s what faith is.  And having that is what it means to be a Christian.     Jesus Came to Give His Life as aRansom for Many     But now let&#146;s take the specific act ofJesus&#146; service  that he mentions in Mark 10:45. The Son of Man did not cometo be served but to  serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. Jesus cameto give his life  as a ransom for many. This is what Christmas is about. Hecame. He did not come to  be served. He came to give his life a ransom for many. Let&#146;sthink about this act of  service.    First of all, let it sink in that this act ofgiving his life as a  ransom was intentional. It says he came to do it. Christ did notcome to earth for other  reasons and then get caught up in a plot that resulted in hisdeath. He came to die.  Hebrews 2:14 puts it plainly:           Since then the children share in fleshand blood, He Himself    likewise also partook of the same, that through death He mightrender powerless him who    had the power of death, that is, the devil.        Jesus came to die.    Look back in this very context to Mark 10:33-34. Jesus is on the road  going up to Jerusalem. There is fear and amazement in the air,because everyone suspects  something tremendous is going to happen. Jesus tells them what heis walking into,  willingly:          Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, andthe Son of Man will be    delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they willcondemn Him to death, and    will deliver Him to the Gentiles. 34 And they will mock Him andspit upon Him, and scourge    Him, and kill Him, and three days later He will riseagain.        So Jesus is knowingly walking into the jaws ofsuffering and death.  Verse 45 says why: He came to give his life a ransom for many.Don&#146;t miss this. Jesus  is choosing to suffer. He is choosing to die. He is participatingintentionally in his own  execution.    Now why is his death called a ransom? TheSon of Man came to give  his life a ransom for many. Ransom is a good translation.The Greek word here ( lutron )  meant just that -- a payment to release someone from some kind ofbondage: prisoners of  war, slavery, debt. So the implication is that Jesus sees hisdeath as a ransom to release  many from bondage. He is paying what they cannot pay so that theymay go free. He is  substituting himself for them. And at the cost of his life, theyget freedom.    So this ransom is describing a substitution.Jesus in the place of the  many. Sometimes people say that the word fordoesn&#146;t have to mean  substitution. Ransom  for  many they say, mayonly mean, for the  benefit of many, not in the place of many. Butlisten to this compelling  word from Leon Morris:         Even if . . . we take the substitutionarymeaning out of the    preposition [for =  anti ], we have not takenit out of the passage, for    the situation [in view] is one in which the many are condemned,their lives are forfeit.    If Jesus gives His life a ransom for many andthereby they are released from    their condemnation, then a substitutionary transaction has takeplace, understand the    individual words as we will. (Leon Morris,  The ApostolicPreaching of the Cross ,    [Grand Rapids; Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1955], p. 36)       That seems exactly right to me. But what is thebondage or slavery that  the many are in that they need to be ransomed from?     What Are the Many RansomedFrom?     Jesus describes us in John 8:34 as enslavedto sin: Truly,  truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave ofsin. He did not see us  as occasionally sinning, but as under   the power of sin. Weare slaves of sin and we  need to be ransomed from its power.    But that&#146;s not the worst of it. Jesustaught that the penalty for  sin is eternal punishment. In Matthew 25:46 he says, Thesewill go away into eternal  punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. Sin bringsthe wrath of God. It  brings judgment. If we don&#146;t find rescue from the guilt ofour sin, we will be  punished, Jesus says, for ever, because sin is an infinite offenseagainst an infinitely  holy God.   So the slavery and the bondage that we needransoming from is the slavery  of sin and eternal punishment  .      How Do We Know We Need Ransoming?     That is what Jesus comes to do: ransom manyfrom the guilt and  power of sin and the penalty of eternal punishment. That is ourcondition. How do we know  this is so?    First, our  conscience  tells us that weare sinners. We know that  we have fallen short of our own standards, and therefore how muchmore must we have fallen  short of God&#146;s. But what about the penalty of that? It isamazing how we excuse  ourselves here. Some say, I am not worse than others.Some say, My sins  are only small, compared to the sins of others Some say,God would not condemn  me, because he is loving. Some say, Eternal punishmentwould be unjust.    But what are all these. They are opinions ofmen. How can you know how  God will respond to your sin when you die? The answer is writtenby God in your heart  (Romans 1:32); and written plainly in his Word. Therefore, do notlet your own mind make  up an answer to this. Way too much hangs on it. Search the Word ofGod. Seek for his  answer and he will show you. I believe the answer is plain inScripture: our condition of  sin will bring judgment and wrath on us after we die if we do notfind a rescue. The  wages of sin is death, said the apostle Paul, but thefree gift of God is  eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23). Thereare two destinies:  eternal life, and eternal death. Eternal death is what we need tobe saved from because of  our sin.     How Does Jesus Ransom Us?     So what then is the way Jesus rescues us?Jesus says, The Son  of Man came . . . to give his life as a ransom for many. Hegives his life for the  many. That is, he dies for many.   The ransom price is hislife  . This is why  the Bible says again and again that Christ  died  to save us.While we were yet  sinners Christ died for us (Romans 5:8). We werejustified by his blood  (Romans 5:9). We were reconciled to God by the death of hisSon (Romans 5:10).  He bore our sins in his body on the cross (1 Peter2:24). Christ died  for sins once for all, the just for the unjust (1 Peter3:18).    The heart of the Christian message is thatChrist came to give his life  a ransom for many. That is, to die for many. That is: to save manyfrom their sin and from  its guilt and power and penalty in eternal punishment.     Are You in the Many?     Now the last question is: who are the many?Are you in the many?  Were you ransomed when Christ died? Are you still under the guiltand power of sin when  you might be free? Are you moving toward eternal life or eternalpunishment? Who are the  many that were ransomed by the Son of Man when he gave his life?    Turn with me to John 15:13. Here Jesus answersthe question about whom  he ransomed. He says, Greater love has no one than this,that one lay down his life  for his friends. He says that he will lay down his life forhis friends. He will  ransom his friends. So here is the question for us this Christmas:Are you a friend of  Jesus? If you are, you were ransomed. If you aren&#146;t, you canbecome one this morning.  What does it mean, to be a friend of Jesus?    The next verse explains (John 15:14): Youare My friends, if you  do what I command you. This is not how you become a friend.This is the way you act  when you are a friend . This is not the way you become hisfriend . It the  evidence   that you are ransomed. The ransom is what frees you and empowersyou to do what Jesus  commands you to do. First you know yourself ransomed, then youenjoy the freedom and power  and fruit of the ransom.    So we have come back to where we started. Jesusdid not come to be  served but to serve. You can&#146;t serve your way into thefriendship of Jesus. If you  want to earn wages from Jesus you are not his friend. Right inJohn 15:14-16 he makes  clear that you can&#146;t be a slave and a friend at the sametime:           You are my friends if you do what Icommand you. No longer do I    call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master isdoing; but I have called    you friends, for all things that I have heard from my Father Ihave made known to you. 16    You did not choose me, but I chose you.        Jesus did not come in search of slave labor. Hedoes not need it. He  came in search of those who would become his friends. That is, hecame in search of those  who would  trust him to serve them . TRUST HIM TO SERVE THEM!For these he laid down  his life. For these he gave his life as a ransom. These are themany in Mark 10:45.  Everyone who trusts the servant Christ as Satisfier, Supplier,Guide, Forgiver.    What creates the friendship is that Jesuschooses you and opens his  heart to you and reveals the glory of the Father. (John 15:15:All things that I  heard from my Father I made known to you. In fact, this isthe essence of becoming a  friend of Jesus: you hear in the  words  of Jesus and you seein the  work  of  Jesus the revelation of God the Father. That revelation changesyou. It causes you to be  born again. It wakens in you faith that Jesus is the finalrevelation of God, and that God  loves you in Christ, and that he will serve you for all eternity.This is what it means to  become the friend of Jesus: seeing in him the all-satisfying gloryof God, and trusting  him to be your servant-guide and your servant-helper, for ever.
