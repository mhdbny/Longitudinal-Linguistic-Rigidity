 April 26, 1998    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor            THE AUTHOR OF THE GREATEST LETTER EVER WRITTEN (First in a   Series of Messages on Romans) (Romans 1:1)        Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set   apart for the gospel of God.        The Time Has Come        For almost 18 years of preaching here at Bethlehem I have   waited and waited for the time when it would seem most fitting to   preach through Paul's letter to the Romans. I have considered it   again and again, and backed off from the task - like a mountain   climber gazing up into the clouds around the peak of Mount Everest   and then turning to lower heights. It has felt very daunting.        But in God's patience and grace, I have felt in recent months   that now is the time. We are coming to the end of a millenium. And   I am well into the second half of my thirty-year pastorate of this   wonderful church - if God wills. The pace of time feels quicker   now at age 52 than it did when I came at age 34. And the gospel of   the glory of Christ, who is the image of God (2 Corinthians 4:4),   seems more glorious to me now than it ever has. And there is no   greater exposition of the Gospel of God than the book of   Romans.        I am not as moved now as I used to be by the tyranny of the   urgent and by the need to respond to every trendy view that blows   across the cultural sea in America. Well past midlife, I have a   deep confidence that the best way to be lastingly relevant is to   stand on rock-solid, durable old truths, rather than jumping from   one pragmatic bandwagon to another. Romans is as solid and durable   and reliable and unshakable and thorough as the truth can get.        My History with Romans        I have a personal history with the book of Romans that might   stir up some of you to join me in the quest to meet God and know   him and worship him and enjoy him and obey him as he meets us in   the book of Romans.        Conversion        I don't remember being converted at age six at my mother's side   in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (as my father reminds me). I only   remember believing. But I do remember learning the meaning of my   conversion - and I learned it from the book of Romans: "All have   sinned and fallen short of the glory of God" (3:23); and "the   wages of sin is death" (6:23); and "God demonstrates His own love   toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"   (5:8); and "if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and   believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will   be saved" (10:9). Which of us, who has tasted the goodness and   glory of God in this great gospel, does not count the book of   Romans precious beyond reckoning?        Call to Ministry of the Word        I went to college thinking that maybe I would be a doctor or a   veterinarian. Then in the summer of 1966, between my sophomore and   junior years, my whole life-direction changed, in the painful and   precious providence of God. He called me to the ministry of the   Word. That fall I had signed up to live with three friends in a   dormitory suite. But midway through the year I knew I needed more   solitude to study and pray the way I felt driven to study. For the   next year and a half I lived alone in the single room of another   dorm. And there I remember - I can see it and almost smell it -   reading John Stott's little yellow book on Romans 5-8 called Men   Made New. The effect on me was to seal the calling to be a   faithful minister of God's Word. So Romans confirmed my   conversion, and Romans confirmed my call to the ministry of the   Word.        Theological Shaping        Then came seminary in 1968-1971, with all the overwhelming   discoveries of the sovereignty of God. And under God the source   from which all that new light was streaming was the book of Romans   - first a course on Romans 1-8 and then a climactic course on the   Unity of the Bible built around Romans 9-11. These were the days   of decisive theological shaping in my life. Everything I have   thought since is rooted there. So my conversion, my call to the   ministry of the Word, and the decisive shaping of my vision of God   was sealed by the book of Romans.        Call to the Pastorate        Then, after three years of study in Germany and six years of   teaching at Bethel, Romans again became the decisive agent of God   in my leaving teaching to become a pastor at this church in 1980.   I had been working on Romans 9 for years, trying to understand the   awesome picture of God in that chapter. In the fall of 1979, I was   given a sabbatical and resolved to settle the matter, as best I   could, and write a book about it. As I immersed myself in Romans 9   day after day, something utterly unexpected happened. The word I   kept hearing for me personally was, "I, the God of Romans 9, will   be heralded, and not just analyzed or explained."        On October 14, 1979, late at night after No&euml;l had already   gone to bed, God did the decisive work of calling me from teaching   in college to preaching in the church. This was in the midst of   writing The Justification of God, an exposition of Romans 9. The   journal entry begins, "I am closer tonight to actually deciding to   resign at Bethel and take a pastorate than I have ever been. . . .   The urge is almost overwhelming. It takes this form: I am   enthralled by the reality of God and the power of his Word to   create authentic people." Within weeks a call came from Bethlehem   that set in motion the events that brought me to this church and   this pulpit. So again it was Romans that seemed to be the hinge on   which the door of my life swung.        Sustaining the Ministry        And though I have never preached through Romans, it has been   the great truths of Romans 8:28 and 8:32 that have sustained the   ministry here these 18 years. And I can say with John Stott that I   have heralded the final triumphant verses of Romans 8 at   innumerable funerals and "never lost the thrill of them" (Romans:   God's Good News for the World &#91;Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity   Press, 1994&#93;, p. 10). "For I am convinced that neither death,   nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor   things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other   created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God,   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38-39).        So I have a personal history with this book. And so do many,   many people. I will be telling you some of their stories in the   weeks - and years - to come (for instance, Augustine, Martin   Luther, John Wesley, Karl Barth and some of you in this   congregation). For now, suffice it to say that Samuel Coleridge,   speaking for many, said, "I think that the Epistle to the Romans   is the most profound work in existence"(Table Talk &#91;Oxford:   Oxford university Press, n.d.&#93;, p. 232). And John Knox (not   the Scot) said that it is "unquestionably the most important   theological work ever written" (The Interpreter's Bible, Vol. 9   &#91;Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1954&#93;, p. 355).        * * * * *        How did this happen? How did it come about that the most   important theological, Christian work ever written came from a   former Jewish Pharisee who hated Christianity (Acts 9:1), and   helped kill the first Christian martyr (Acts 7:58; 8:1), and   persecuted the early church with passion (1 Timothy 1:13)? How did   it happen that this man wrote a 22-page, 7100-word letter that   "century after century . . . has been the flame at which one great   Christian leader after another . . . has kindled his own torch to   the revival of the church and the enrichment of Christendom" (A.   M. Hunter, Introducing the New Testament &#91;Gateshead: SCM Press   Ltd., 1972&#93;, p. 94)?        The answer begins in Romans 1:1, in the first three phrases of   the book - "Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an   apostle, set apart for the gospel of God." Take them one at a time   and ponder what they mean about this man and his letter and his   God. In all three phrases the crucial thing is not who Paul is,   but whose Paul is. And this will, in the end, be what makes your   life significant or not - not who you are, but whose you are.        A Bond-servant of Christ Jesus        First, Paul, the writer of this letter, says he is "a   bond-servant of Christ Jesus." We are confronted immediately with   a choice: is this man a deluded maniac? Jesus, called Christ, was   killed in about A.D. 30 by a Roman governor named Pilate. We have   several secular, historical testimonies to that fact. He was dead.   Now here is Paul saying that this man, Christ Jesus, is not dead   but is his master, and that he is the man's slave. Are these 16   chapters the rantings of a delusion? You must decide.        Paul's own testimony is not that he is deluded but that he is   bought and owned and ruled by his own contemporary, who died and   rose from the dead - Christ Jesus. I say "bought and owned,"   because that's what being a bond servant implies. In 1 Corinthians   7:23, Paul says, "You were bought with a price; do not become   slaves of men." In other words, Christians are slaves of Christ   because he bought us by dying for us, and therefore he owns us.   "You are not your own. For you have been bought with a price:   therefore glorify God in your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Paul   is the bond-servant of Christ Jesus because Christ bought him and   owns him.        It also means that this living Christ rules him. In Galatians   1:10, Paul says, "Am I striving to please men? If I were still   trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ." In   other words, being a bond-servant of Christ means utter submission   to what pleases him, not what pleases anybody else.        So Paul's self-understanding is that he is bought and owned and   ruled by Christ Jesus - a man who was killed as a criminal perhaps   25 years before this letter was written, and who, Paul will say in   verse 4, was raised from the dead and is the absolutely unique Son   of God in power. In other words, here in this history-making   letter we are not dealing with a man and his genius. We are   dealing with a man and his Owner and Ruler and God. This begins to   explain why the letter is no ordinary letter.        Called as an Apostle        Second, Paul says that he is "&#91;not only&#93; a bond-servant   of Christ Jesus, &#91;but also&#93; called as an apostle." He is   not only bought and owned and ruled; he is also called. Paul's   significance is not first or primarily what he has done, but what   has been done to him - he has been bought and owned; he has been   called and he has been set apart. Someone else is the Primary   Actor here, not Paul. We are not dealing in this letter merely   with the work of a man, but with the work of God in a man.        In Paul's mind, to be an apostle was to be a person who had   seen Jesus Christ risen from the dead so that he could give   first-hand testimony, and who had been commissioned and authorized   by Christ to represent him and speak for him and provide a   foundation for his church through true and authoritative   teaching.        Paul saw Jesus on the Damascus Road. And there Jesus called him   into his apostolic ministry. He says in 1 Corinthians 15:7-8,   "&#91;Jesus&#93; appeared to James, then to all the apostles; and   last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also."   There Jesus said to him, "For this purpose I have appeared to you,   to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things   which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear   to you" (Acts 26:16). With this commission he became one of the   founders of Christianity, as it says in Ephesians 2:20, The church   has been "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,   Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone."        If we ask today where the foundation of the apostles is for the   church and its life and ministry, the answer is: in the deposit of   writings that they left behind. And among all those apostolic   writings there is none like the Letter to the Romans. It is simply   the great Biblical summary of the great gospel and is therefore   preeminently the foundation of the church, with Christ as the   cornerstone. Paul says that he is "called as an apostle" so that   the church - so that we - will receive the book of Romans as the   message not just of a man, but of Christ. Romans is not great   because it is the word of a genius, but because it is the word of   God (see 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 2:13). That's the   significance of being called as an apostle.        Set Apart for the Gospel of God        Finally, Paul says that he is not only "a bond-servant of   Christ Jesus, &#91;and not only&#93; called as an apostle,   &#91;but he was also&#93; set apart for the gospel of God."        When did that happen - being set apart for the gospel of God?   Galatians 1:15 says, "God . . . set me apart even from my mother's   womb." This means that before Paul was bought as a slave, and   before he was called on the Damascus road, and before he was born,   God set him apart for the gospel of God. Which means that God did   not look around for a person to fill the apostolic role; he   prepared Paul from his mother's womb to serve the gospel - which   is an astonishing thing when you realize the pathway that led from   the womb to the Damascus road, namely, Paul's unbelief and   persecution of the church.        Which means that in the very first verse of this great book we   taste some of the magnitude of God's inscrutable wisdom which Paul   worships in 11:33-36 ("Oh, the depth of the riches both of the   wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments   and unfathomable His ways!"). God did not leave anything to chance   in the founding of his church through the writing of his apostles:   He set him apart before birth; he purchased him by the death of   his Son; he called him effectively on the Damascus road.        Romans is about God        So verse one may look like it is about the author of the   letter; but behind every phrase is Someone far greater. God bought   him by the death of his Son, God called him to be an apostle   (Galatians 1:15; 1 Corinthians 1:1), God set him apart from before   he was born. And he did it all, "for the gospel of God" - which we   will look at next week. In other words, even in the first verse we   hear Romans 11:36, "From him and through him and to him are all   things. To him be glory for ever."        Leon Morris is exactly right when he says, "God is the most   important word in this epistle. Romans is a book about God. No   topic is treated with anything like the frequency of God.   Everything Paul touches in this letter he relates to God. In our   concern to understand what the apostle is saying about   righteousness, justification and the like we ought not to overlook   his tremendous concentration on God. There is nothing like it   elsewhere" (The Epistle to the Romans &#91;Grand Rapids: Wm. B.   Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1988), p.40).        Indeed there isn't. This is why the epistle has had the effect   it has. It is from God and through God and to God. God chose the   author before he was born. God purchased his freedom by the death   of his Son. God called him to be an apostle. And then God gave him   a gospel - the Gospel of God himself. So God is at the bottom and   God is at the top and God is in the middle.        And since we are dedicated as a church to spreading a passion   for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples,   it is, I believe, time to meet God in the book of Romans. I   believe God has chosen us, called us and set us apart for this   very thing. Pray with me that his word would run and triumph in   the salvation of many and the building up of his church to the   glory of his name.
