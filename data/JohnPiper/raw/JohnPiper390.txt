       LET THE NATIONS BE GLAD!    (Psalm 67)       
        God be gracious to us and bless us, and cause His      face to shine upon us--that Thy way may be known on the earth,      Thy salvation among all nations. Let the peoples praise Thee, O      God; let all the peoples praise Thee. Let the nations be glad      and sing for joy; for Thou wilt judge the peoples with      uprightness, and guide the nations on the earth. Let the      peoples praise Thee, O God; let all the peoples prise Thee. The      earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us. God      blesses us, that all the ends of the earth may fear Him.         
        Overview of 1986 Missions Fest sermon        When I preached on this Psalm several years ago in our 1986   Missions conference I passed over the main point of the Psalm   explaining that Don Richardson was going to cover that at his   seminar. Instead I took my points from the rest of the Psalm.       I said that the Psalm teaches that God's purpose is to be known   and praised and enjoyed and feared among all the nations.       To be known: verse 2 -- "That Thy way may be known on the   earth."       To be praised: verse 3 -- "Let the peoples praise Thee, O God;   Let all the peoples praise Thee."       To be enjoyed: verse 4 -- "Let the nations be glad and sing for   joy."       To be feared: verse 7 -- "That all the ends of the earth may   fear Him."       That was my first point: God is jealous to be known and praised   and enjoyed and feared. He is displeased when people are ignorant   of him or disrespectful to him or bored around him or unduly   casual in his presence.       The second point was that what God wants people to know about   him is that he is a God of justice, a God of power, and a God of   grace.       A God of justice: verse 4 -- "Thou wilt judge the peoples with   uprightness."       A God of power: verse 4 -- "&#91;Thou wilt&#93; guide the   nations on the earth."       A God of grace: verse 1 -- "God be gracious to us and bless   us."       In other words six years ago I stressed what is just as true,   and even more needed, today -- namely, that there is one true and   living God and that he wills to be known by all the peoples of the   world. And that means known subjectively with joy and praise and   fear, and known objectively as being one kind of God and not   another -- being just and powerful and gracious.       Psalm 67 does not support the kind of new age spirituality so   common today that simply emphasizes the mood of serenity and   solemnity through meditation and centering without any serious   concern that the Object in focus be the true an living God.       God wants to be known for who he really is: just and gracious   and powerful, so that our praise and joy and fear are rooted in   reality not imagination and really show God's worth and glory.        The main point of Psalm 67        A. God Blesses us so that the nations will be blessed       But I passed over the main point seven years ago -- at least in   one sense it's the main point. The main point of the Psalm is what   the Psalmist does with all that truth. He knows that God wills to   be known and praised and enjoyed and feared for who hear really   is. So his response is to pray that God would bless Israel in such   a way that God really would be known among the nations.       In other words, the main point of the psalm is the link between   verses 1 and 2 found in the word "that." He prays, "God be   gracious to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us;   2 that Thy way may be known on the earth, Thy salvation among all   nations."       So the point I want to stress this morning is this: God blesses   his people for the sake of the nations. This was the foundational   truth that God spoke to Abraham when he called him out of Ur of   the Chaldees: "I will make you a great nation, and I will bless   you, and make your name great; and so you shall be a blessing; and   I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I   will curse. And in you all the families of the earth shall be   blessed" (Genesis 12:2-3).       It was a theme that Isaiah and others picked up in words like,   "I will give you (Israel) as a light to the nations, that my   salvation may reach to the end of the earth" (Isaiah 49:6).       This is almost exactly what the psalmist says in Psalm 67:1-2.   Only the psalmist turns that promise into a prayer (which is what   we should do with promises): "God be gracious to us and bless us,   and cause His face to shine upon us; 2 that Thy way may be known   on the earth, Thy salvation among all nations."       God promises blessing to his people because he wants them to be   a blessing to the nations. Therefore we should pray for blessing   on ourselves for the sake of the nations.       This is not because God does not love us, or is just using us.   It's because he loves the nations and because he knows that our   joy in all that God is for us increases when it expands into the   lives of others. In other words, when we ask for God's blessing on   us for the sake of the nations we are also asking for our joy to   be full.       B. God will most likely bless us when we are planning to bless   the nations       There is another point implied in this main one: if God blesses   his people for the sake of the nations; then God is most likely to   bless us when we are planning and longing and praying to bless the   nations. If God wants his goods to get to the nations, then he   will fill the truck that's driving toward the nations. He will   bless the church that's pouring itself out for unreached peoples   of the world. And this blessing is not payment for a service   rendered; it's power and joy for a mission to accomplish. When we   move toward the unreached peoples we are not earning God's   blessings, we are leaping into the river of blessings that is   already flowing to the nations.       So we have two truths in the connection between verses 1 and 2.   1) God blesses his people for the sake of the nations. 2)   Therefore God is most likely to bless us when we are planning and   longing and praying to bless the nations--and to make the nations   glad in God.       C. 10 ways God has blessed Bethlehem       The way I to want reinforce these two truths in your mind this   morning is to tell you about ten blessings from the last decade   here at Bethlehem, which, I think, illustrate a few ways that God   blesses a people who are bent on blessing the nations -- the   unreached peoples of the earth.       Bethlehem was a fairly missions-minded church when I came 13   years ago, but I was not very missions-minded pastor when I came.   A book like this (Let the Nations Be Glad: the Supremacy of God in   Missions) would have been unthinkable for me to write in 1980. But   God did some pretty decisive things in the fall of 1983 -- ten   years ago this month.       I preached the sermon, "Missions: The Battle Cry of Christian   Hedonism" and felt that a Rubicon had been crossed. Tom Steller   and I and others that were here in those days felt like a new   calling had come on our lives to direct this church more and more   toward the unfinished task of reaching the unreached peoples.       I look back at my journal from those days and find the evidence   of God's hand getting us ready for more blessing by turning our   hearts to the nations.       For example, on December 9, 1983 I wrote,       "Noel and I are reading Ruth Tucker's book, From      Jerusalem to Irian Jaya. Last night I read the section on      Zinzendorf. It was encouraging because it showed that a man can      inspire others to do a thing for which he is unsuited...      Zinzendorf inspired a great missionary force but in the few      efforts of foreign missionary service which he made, his      experience was unhappy...             Whatever I am good for it is encouraging to know that others      can be inspired to do what I may be unsuited for. We are not      apparently locked in to only mobilizing duplicates of      ourselves.             Is this not already happening at BBC? I am praying that we      become increasingly a launching pad for missionaries and      pastors and teachers and evangelists. Matthew 9:38 now precedes      Mt. 28:19-20 in my missionary thinking. I must not feel      squeamish, as I have, about challenging others to do things I      may not be very good at or comfortable in.        Eight days later there is an entry on how inspiring Mary   Drewry's biography of William Carey was to me because of all the   hardships he endured without every giving up for 40 years in   India.       A month later in January of 1984 I wrote,       A new sense is in my life owing to my new awakening to      the big unfinished Cause of Missions and to the wartime      mentality I am trying to cultivate. The sense is this: as I      kneel to pray this morning about a very busy Monday I feel a      new strategicness about it all. I feel the sense of wanting and      expecting God to make every meeting and visit and report and      leisurely contact and Bible study and preparation a part of a      plot, thought through and schemed for the effectual execution      of a strategic invasion of Satan's domain either to achieve      today some act of liberation for the captives, or to plant      decisive explosives at the prison doors and lay the wires and      hide the maps and rations for the day not far hence when I or      someone else will ignite the fuse of God's power.        Six weeks later in the glow of the first Missions in the Manse   I wrote a prayer:       Lord Jesus Christ, rise like the sun on our darkness.      Be exalted in your matchless power and wisdom and love! To see      you and know you in your fullness Lord Christ is the key to all      power. . . So I look to you. I marvel at you. I long to know      you. Shine Lord! Crack the dark in every heart, Lord Jesus. Use      me. Use me. Use me to fill the world with your glory.        God was doing something in those days to fix our prayers and   our hopes and our plans on the nations. In view of what Psalm 67   says in verses 1 and 2 I attribute many of our blessings in the   last ten years to this awakened sense of calling to be a church   for the nations, as well as a church for the neighborhood. God   blesses his people for the sake of the nations. And if we devote   ourselves to reaching the nations, God will very likely bless us.       Let me list off ten of the blessings that I think have come for   the sake of the unreached peoples of the earth.       1. For the nations God has blessed us with ten years of   intense, earnest, authentic, God-centered, hope-giving,   life-changing worship. One of the reasons for this blessing is   that we see worship as the fuel and the goal of world missions.   The goal of world missions is the gladness of the peoples in the   glory of God. The fuel of that goal is our own gladness in God. If   we are not real and deep and fervent in our worship of God, we   will not commend him among the peoples with genuineness. How can   you say to the nations, "Be glad in God!", if you are not glad in   God?       2. For the nations God has blessed us with passionate,   God-sized, globe-circling prayer. We do not have big prayer   meetings. But there are many small clusters of praying people. And   the ones I am a part of bear the wonderful marks of missionary   zeal. They are laced with the bigness and unstopability of God's   purposes in history.       3. For the nations God has blessed us with suffering. We cannot   calculate the good effects of God's severe mercies in these recent   years. It has broken us, softened us, weaned us more from pride   and from the temporary things of the world, and fixed us more on   the eternal matters of salvation and holiness and the lostness of   the peoples. God gives us the gift of suffering for the sake of   the nations.       4. For the nations God has blessed many of you with courageous   faith. When Tim White was shot there was no mass exodus from the   city. When the violence subsided in Congo, Steve and Julie went   back. When there was the threat of radio activity in their town in   China, Mark and Rene went back. When ELWA was surrounded by rebel   forces, David Decker stayed behind. When political upheavals are   expected in Guinea this December, David and Faith go in anyway.   God is blessing us with the preciousness of genuine courageous   faith because we have our hearts set on the nations. They won't be   reached without it.       5. For the nations God has blessed us with a World Christian   pastoral staff. Is it an accident that all of us have been   overseas in one kind of ministry or another? Dan Lehn in China,   David Livingston in Nigeria, Tom Steller in Cameroon, Joan   Lovestrand in Indonesia and the Philippines, Brad Nelson in Mexico   and Thailand, Greg Dirnberger in Japan, Dean Palermo Colombia,   David Michael in Equador, and I in Liberia. This is a blessing   from God on this church for the sake of the nations.       6. For the nations God has blessed us with increasing numbers   of people. In 1983 there were less than 600 of us in worship.   Today there are about 1200. Here's an entry from my journal in   April 1983: "Let's grow in order to build a sending base for the   frontiers. Let's think of recruiting people for the mission of   evangelizing unevangelized cultures. God will not honor our zeal   for growth if it is motivated by vanity. But he will if it is   motivated by love for his glory and concern for the cultures   without a gospel witness." I believe God honored that and has   given us growth for the sake of the nations.       7. For the nations God has blessed us with increased giving.   Not just because there are more people but because there is more   radical commitment to live and give like heaven and hell are at   stake. The giving per attender has far more than doubled between   1983 and 1993. Our missions budget has increased in that period   six fold from $72,000 to $484,000 and from 22% of the budget to   34% of the budget while the compensation for pastors and staff has   dropped from 52% to 42% of the budget. This remarkable increase is   the blessing of God for the sake of the nations.       8. For the nations God has blessed us with this building. That   is&yuml;a controversial thing to say. Not all of us thought we   should build a building like this. But God is merciful with the   honest disagreements of his people. The fund raising plan was   called SPAN I and then SPAN III -- Spreading Praise to All   Nations. God blessed us with this building for the sake of the   nations. That was our plan -- that it exist to spread praise to   all the nations. If we honor that intention, God will see to it   that the building is paid for, and perhaps sooner than the seven   years that remain on the loan.       9. For the nations God has blessed us with a vision, a prayer   goal, of 2000 by 2000 -- to send 2000 people out from us (in short   term or vocational missions) and to win 2000 people from lostness   here at home, by the year 2000.       10. For the nations God has blessed us with missionaries. It is   overwhelming how many people, younger and older, are being called   by God to uproot from the comforts and security of Minnesota to   minister cross-culturally for the sake of the kingdom. Of the 85   people listed on your blue folder this morning only 9 of them, I   believe, were already on the field in 1982. And besides these   there are now over 50 people in the nurture program on the way   into missions at Bethlehem. In one sense, Bethlehem is not just a   church, it's a missionary recruiting and support agency. God   continues to answer the prayer of Matthew 9:38 among us: "Lord of   the harvest, send out workers into your fields."       We have seen in Psalm 67 and we have seen in our experience the   truth that God blesses his people for the sake of the nations. Now   I want to pray for his added blessing, especially on two groups of   people.       One, those of you who have discerned God's call on your life   and are now moving intentionally through whatever processes are   necessary toward a missionary vocation cross-culturally.       Two, those of you who in recent years or even days have been   unsettled where you are and are wondering seriously if God might   be calling you and are seeking his will in this matter and would   like prayer for clarity and assurance whether for next year or   five years from now.       There is every reason Biblically to believe that the blessing   of God will remain on us in the years to come if we remain   committed to being a blessing to the unreached peoples of the   world -- not just to the people around us, and not neglecting the   people around us, but remembering that there are several thousand   of people groups with no witness to Christ at all. Not forgetting   that the University of Minnesota has thousands of unbelievers next   door, but also remembering that in Turkey there are 343   universities with 500,000 students with not one Christian student   organization planted on those campuses.       We are on the brink of a tremendous surge in missionary sending   at Bethlehem. It is necessary that all ten of these blessings from   the last ten years keep on abounding -- and more. Give yourselves   to prayer for the company of goers and for the enlarging and   strengthening of the sending base here at home.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
