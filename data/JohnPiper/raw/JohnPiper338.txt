 January 5, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       HOW TO PRAY FOR A DESOLATE CHURCH    (Daniel 9:1-23)        The reason I titled this message "How to Pray for a Desolate   Church" is that I see much of the Christian church today as   desolate. The ruin of Jerusalem and the captivity of Israel in   Babylon are pictures of the church today in many places around the   world. There are pockets of life and purity and depth and   faithfulness and power and zeal around the world. God will never   give up on his people and he will get his global purposes done   even if he has to use a remnant to do it.        But much of the Christian movement today has become a   desolation of disobedience and disunity and dishonor to the name   of Christ. So the way Daniel prays for the desolation of his   people is a pointer for how we can pray for the desolation of   ours.        Let me mention three aspects of the desolation of God's people   in this text to see if you won't agree that it sounds like much of   the Christian movement today.         1. The people are captive to godless   forces.         Two times, verses 11 and 13, Daniel says that this calamity of   Babylonian captivity was warned against in the law of Moses. For   example, in Deuteronomy 28:36 Moses says that if the people   forsake God, "The Lord will bring you . . . to a nation that   neither you nor your fathers have known; and there you shall serve   other gods." Now that had come true in Babylon.        In 1520, Martin Luther wrote an essay which he called "The   Babylonian Captivity of the Church." What he meant was that forces   and powers that were foreign to Christ and to his word had   captured the mind and heart of the church. She was in bondage to   godless forces.        That is the situation in much of the church today. Millions of   church-goers today think the way the world thinks. The simple   assumptions that govern behavior and choices come more from what   is absorbed from our culture than from the word of God. The church   shares the love affair of the world with prosperity and ease and   self. Many groups of Christians are just not that different from   the spirit of Babylon, even though the Lord says that we are   aliens and exiles and that we are not to be conformed to this age.   So, like Israel of old, much of God's church today is captive to   godless forces.         2. The people are guilty and ashamed.         Daniel spends most of his prayer confessing the sin of the   people. For example, verse 5: "We have sinned and done wrong and   acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from thy commandments."   In other words, we have great guilt before God. And because of   this real guilt there is real shame. This is mentioned in verses 7   and 8. The RSV has the phrase "confusion of face"--"To us belongs   confusion of face." Literally it means, "To us belongs shame of   face". What we have done is so terrible and so known that our face   turns red and we want to cover it and run away. That is the way   Daniel felt about the people of God. Their guilt and their shame   were great.        Today in the church there is an uneasy conscience. There is the   deep sense that we are to be radically different, living on the   brink of eternity with counter-cultural values and behaviors of   love and justice and risk-taking service that show our citizenship   is in heaven. But then, we look in the mirror and we see that the   church does not look that way. And the result is a sense of shame   based on the real guilt of unbelief and disobedience. So we slink   through our days with faces covered, and scarcely anyone knows we   are disciples of Jesus.         3. Finally, the people were a byword among the   nations.         Verse 16b: "Jerusalem and thy people have become a byword among   all who are round about us." "Byword" (in the RSV) means reproach,   or object of scorn. It means that the nations look at the defeated   and scattered Israelites and they laugh. They mock Israel's   God.        That is the way it is with the Christian church in many places.   She has made the name of Jesus an object of scorn by her   duplicity--trying to go by the name Christian and yet marching to   the drum of the world. So the world sees the name "Christian" as   nothing radically different--perhaps a nice way to add a little   component of spirituality to the other parts of life that   basically stay the same.        
So when Daniel prays for the desolations of the people of   Israel, I hear a prayer for the desolations of the Christian   church--captive to godless forces, guilty and ashamed, and a   byword among the nations.         Now how do we pray for such a church?           1. First, we pray for a desolate church by   beginning where Daniel began. We go to the   books.          Verse 2: "In the first year of &#91;Darius's&#93; reign, I,   Daniel, perceived in the books . . ." The books are the prophet   Jeremiah and other Biblical books. Prayer begins with the   Bible.        George Mueller said that for years he tried to pray without   starting in the Bible in the morning. And inevitably his mind   wandered. Then he started with the Book, and turned the Book into   prayer as he read, and for 40 years he was able to stay focussed   and powerful in prayer.        Without the Bible in our prayers, they will be just as worldly   as the church we are trying to free from worldliness. Daniel's   prayer begins with the Bible and it is saturated with the Bible.   Phrase after phrase comes right out of the Scriptures. There are   allusions to Leviticus (26:40) and Deuteronomy (28:64) and Exodus   (34:6) and Psalms (44:14) and Jeremiah (25:11). The prayer brims   with a Biblical view of reality, because it brims with the   Bible.        What I have seen is that those whose prayers are most saturated   with Scripture are generally most fervent and most effective in   prayer. And where the mind isn't brimming with the Bible, the   heart is not generally brimming with prayer. This is not my idea.   Jesus was pointing to it in John 15:7 when he said, "If you abide   in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it   shall be done for you" (John 5:7). When he says, "If my words   abide in you . . ." he means, "If my words saturate your mind . .   . if my words shape your way if thinking . . . if my words are   memorized and just as likely to come to your mind as advertising   jingles . . ." then you will pray so as to heal the desolations of   the church."        So the first way to pray for a desolate church is to go to the   Book. Saturate your mind with the Bible. Pray the scripture.          2. The second way to pray for a desolate church is   to confess our sin.           About 12 verses of Daniel's prayer is confession: verses 4-15.   This means being truthful about God and about sin.        It means recognizing sin as sin and calling it bad names, not   soft names: things like wickedness and rebellion and wrong (v. 5)   and treachery (v. and shameful (v. 7) and disobedience (v. 10). It   means recognizing God as righteous (v. 7) and great and fearful   (v. 4) and merciful and forgiving (v. 9). It means feeling broken   and remorseful and guilty (v. 8) before God.        Before God! There is a difference between feeling miserable   because sin has made our life miserable and feeling broken because   our sin has offended the holiness of God and brought reproach on   his name. Daniel's confession--Biblical confession--is   God-centered. The issue is not admitting that we have made our   life miserable. The issue is admitting that there is something   much worse than our misery, namely the offended holiness and glory   of God.        So we pray for a desolate church by going to the Book &amp; by   confessing our sins.          3. The way to pray for a desolate church is to   remember past mercies, and be encouraged that God never   changes.          Verse 15: "And now, O Lord our God, who didst bring thy people   out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand . . ." Daniel knew   that the reason God saved Israel from Egypt was not because Israel   was so good. Psalm 106:7-8,        Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy   wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy   steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High at the Red Sea.   Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known   his mighty power.        Prayer for a desolate church is sustained by the memory of past   mercies. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever   (Hebrews 13:8). If God saved a rebellious people once at the Red   Sea, he can save them again. So when we pray for a desolate   church, we can remember brighter days that the church has known,   and darker days from which she was saved.        This is why church history is so valuable. There have been bad   days before that God had turned around. The papers this week have   been full of statistics of America's downward spiral into violence   and corruption. Church history is a great antidote to despair at   times like this. For example, to read about the moral decadence   and violence of 18th century England before God sent George   Whitefield and John Wesley is like reading today's newspapers. For   example,        Only five or six members of parliament even went to church. . .   The plague, small pox, and countless diseases we call minor today   had no cures. . . Clothing was expensive, so many of the cities'   poor wore rags that were like their bedding, full of lice. . . The   penalties for crimes seem barbaric today (hanging for petty   thievery). . . Young boys, and sometimes girls, were bound over to   a master for seven years of training. They worked six days a week,   every day from dawn to dusk and often beyond. . . If you were   unlucky and starving, you might fall foul of the law and be packed   off to the stench of New gate Prison. From there, you might have   the chance to go to the New World in a boat loaded with prisoners   of all sorts. . . &#91;Drunkenness was rampant&#93; and gin was   fed to the babies too, to keep them quiet, with blindness and   often death as a result (did you think crack babies were a new   thing?). . . The people's love of tormenting animals at   bull-baitings was equaled only by their delight in a public   execution. (Taken from "Revival and Revolution" in Christian   History, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 7-8.)        All that and more, including a desolate and corrupt and   powerless church. Yet God moved with a great awakening. And to add   hope upon hope for our prayers, he used two men who could not   agree on some significant theological points and one of them was   overweight and the other was 5' 3" tall and weighed 128   pounds.        We pray for a desolate church by remembering past mercies, past   triumphs of grace. We remember that history is not a straight line   down any more than it is a straight line up.          4. Finally, we pray for a desolate church by   appealing to God's zeal for the glory of his own   name.          Look how the prayer comes to its climax in verses 18b-19: "We   do not present our supplications before thee on the ground of our   righteousness but on the ground of thy great mercy. 19) O Lord,   hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, give heed and act; delay not, for   thy own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called   by thy name."        The people of God are known by his name. And God has an   infinite zeal for his own name. He will not let it be reproached   and made a byword indefinitely. That is our deepest confidence.   God is committed to God. God is committed with explosive passion   to the glory of his name and the truth of his reputation.        So that's the bottom of our prayer for a desolate church. We   are called by your name. We live by your name. Not to us, O Lord,   not to us, but to your name give glory. For your name's sake, O   Lord, save. For your name's sake, revive. For your name's sake   purify and heal and empower your church, O Lord. For we are called   by your name.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
