  October 23, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       WHY WE CAN REJOICE IN SUFFERING    (1 Peter 4:12-19)        Beloved, do not be surprised at the fieryordeal among      you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some      strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you      share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also      at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with      exultation. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are      blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.      By no means let any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or      evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; but if anyone suffers as a      Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but in that name let him      glorify God. For it is time for judgment to begin with the      household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be      the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And if      it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will      become of the godless man and the sinner? Therefore, let those      also who suffer according to the will of God entrust their      souls to a faithful Creator in doing what isright.         It might seem strange to you that 1 Peter is one of my favorite   Biblical books -- since it's mostly about suffering and how to   live in a hostile culture, while I am a card-carrying,   full-blooded, unwavering Christian Hedonist. But it isn't strange   for people who have lived long enough to realize what Paul Brand,   the missionary surgeon to India wrote in his book: Pain: The Gift   Nobody Wants.       I have come to see that pain and pleasure come to us not as   opposites but as Siamese twins, strangely joined and intertwined.   Nearly all my memories of acute happiness, in fact, involve some   element of pain or struggle. (Christianity Today, Jan, 10, 1994,   p. 21)       I have never heard anyone say, "The deepest and rarest and most   satisfying joys of my life have come in times of extended ease and   earthly comfort." Nobody says that. It isn't true. What's true is   what Samuel Rutherford said when he was put in the cellars of   affliction: "The Great King keeps his wine there" -- not in the   courtyard where the sun shines. What's true is what Charles   Spurgeon said: "They who dive in the sea of affliction bring up   rare pearls."       Christian Hedonists will do anything to have the King's wine   and the rare pearls -- even go to the cellars of suffering and   dive in the sea of affliction. And so you can see that it is not   strange that we love the epistle of 1 Peter -- a handbook for   Christian persecution and martyrdom.       When Bernie May was the head of Wycliffe Bible Translators he   visited a young family in a Muslim nation. They had been there   three years working with a people group of 100,000 people and no   knowledge of Christ. This couple had three children under five   years old.       The baby was covered with pox marks, some of which looked   infected. He asked if the child had chicken pox. "No, those are   ant bites," the mother said. "We can't keep the ants off him.   Eventually he will become immune to them."       Bernie May wrote:       In a moment of honesty she confessed she felt guilty because   she was suffering from stress. Stress! She and her young husband   came there from mid-USA. Now they live in a place where the   temperature is above 100 degrees most of the year. The children   are covered with bites; a war is going on close by; their helpers   are in danger for being their friends; many in the villages are   suffering from hunger and disease; they can't even let their   supporters know what they are doing so that they can pray for them   since they are in a "critical" area -- and she feels guilty   because she is under stress.       I told her she had every right to feel stressful. I had only   been their three days and I was already beginning to come unglued.       Yet this dedicated young couple are laughing and joking and   filled with the joy of the Lord. (Letter from Bernie May, Jan.   1990)       1 Peter is a letter mainly about how to be like that. Today's   text in fact commands us to be like that and gives at least six   reasons why we should be and can be.       The command is found in verse 13: "To the degree that you share   the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing." Keep on rejoicing.   When you are thrown in the cellars of suffering keep on rejoicing.   When you dive in the sea of affliction, keep on rejoicing. In   fact, keep on rejoicing not in spite of the affliction but even   because of it. This is not little piece of advice about the power   of positive thinking. This is a an utterly radical, abnormal,   supernatural way to respond to suffering. It is not in our power.   It is not for the sake of our honor. It is the way spiritual   aliens and exiles live on the earth for the glory of the great   King.       "Count it all joy when you meet various trials," is foolish   advice, except for one thing -- God. Peter gives six reasons why   we can "keep on rejoicing" when the suffering comes. They all   relate to God.       1. Keep on rejoicing because the suffering is not a surprise   but a plan.       Verse 12: "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal   among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some   strange thing were happening to you."       It isn't strange. It isn't absurd. It isn't meaningless. It is   purposeful. It is for your testing. Look at verse 19: "Let those   also who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls   to a faithful Creator." "According to God's will." Suffering is   not outside the will of God. It is in God's will. This is true   even when Satan may be the immediate cause. God is sovereign over   all things, including our suffering, and including Satan.       By why? For what purpose. Compare verses 12 and 17. Verse 12   your fiery ordeal comes "for your testing." Verse 17 says, "For it   is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it   begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do   not obey the gospel of God?" The point is that God's judgment is   moving through the earth. The church does not escape. When the   fire of judgment burns the church, it is a testing, proving,   purifying fire. When it burns the world it either awakens or   destroys.       Verse 18: "And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is   saved, what will become of the godless man and the sinner?"   Believers pass through the testing fire of God's judgment -- not   because he hates us, but because he loves us and wills our purity.   God hates sin so much and loves his children so much that he will   spare us no pain to rid us of what he hates.       So reason number one is that suffering is not surprising; it is   planned. It is a testing. It is purifying fire. It proves and   strengthens real faith, and it consumes "performance faith."       Alexander Solzhenitsyn had long been impressed with the   patience and longsuffering of Russian believers. One night in   prison in Siberia Boris Kornfeld, a Jewish doctor, sat up with   Solzhenitsyn and told him the story of his conversion to Christ.   The same night Kornfeld was clubbed to death. Solzhenitsyn said   that Kornfeld's last words were, "lay upon me as an inheritance. .   . It was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I   sensed within myself the first stirrings of good . . . Bless you,   prison, for having been my life."       We have strong hope therefore that the sufferings of our own   day will bring purity and life to many. Suffering is not   surprising; it is purposeful.       2. Keep on rejoicing because your suffering as a Christian is   an evidence of your union with Christ.       Verse 13a: "But to the degree that you share the sufferings of   Christ, keep on rejoicing." In other words your sufferings are not   merely your own. They are also Christ's. This is cause for   rejoicing because it means you are united to Christ.       Joseph Tson, a Romanian pastor who stood up to Ceausescu's   repressions of Christianity, wrote,       This union with Christ is the most beautiful subject in the   Christian life. It means that I am not a lone fighter here: I am   an extension of Jesus Christ. When I was beaten in Romania, He   suffered in my body. It is not my suffering: I only had the honor   to share His sufferings. (undated paper: A Theology of Martyrdom)       Keep on rejoicing, because your sufferings as a Christian are   not merely yours but Christ's and give evidence of your union with   him.       3. Keep on rejoicing because this joy will strengthen your   assurance that when Christ comes in glory you will rejoice for   ever with him.       Verse 13b: "&#91;As you share the sufferings of Christ&#93;   keep on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory,   you may rejoice with exultation." Notice: keep on rejoicing now,   so that you may rejoice then. Our joy now through suffering is the   means of attaining our joy then, a thousand-fold in glory.       First there is suffering, then there is glory. 1 Peter 1:11,   "The Spirit predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glory to   follow" (cf. 5:1). Paul said, "If we suffer with him we will be   glorified with him." First the suffering, and then the glory --   both for Jesus and for those who are united to him.       If we become embittered at life and the pain it deals us, we   are not preparing to rejoice at the revelation of Christ's glory.   Keep on rejoicing now in suffering in order that you might rejoice   with exultation at the revelation of his glory.       4. Keep on rejoicing in suffering because then the Spirit of   glory and of God rest upon you.       Verse 14: "If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are   blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."       This means that in the hour of greatest trial there is a great   consolation. In great suffering on earth there is great support   from heaven. You may think now that you will not be able to bear   it. But if you are Christ's you will be able to bear it, because   he will come to you and rest upon you. As Rutherford said, The   Great King keeps his finest wine in the cellar of affliction. He   does not bring it out to serve with chips and on sunny afternoons.   He keeps it for extremities.       If you say, "What is this?" -- the Spirit of glory and of God   resting on me in suffering -- the answer is simply this: you will   find out when you need it. The Spirit will reveal enough of glory   and enough of God to satisfy your soul, and carry you through.       Seek to be holy; seek to bring truth; seek to bear witness; and   do not turn aside from risk. And sooner or later you will   experience the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon you in   suffering.       5. Keep on rejoicing in suffering because this glorifies God.       Verse 16: "If anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel   ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God."       Glorifying God means showing by your actions and attitudes that   God is glorious to you -- that he is valuable, precious,   desirable, satisfying. And the greatest way to show that someone   satisfies your heart is to keep on rejoicing in them when all   other supports for your satisfaction are falling away. When you   keep rejoicing in God in the midst of suffering it shows that God,   and not other things, is the great source of your joy.       I mentioned Paul Brand earlier -- the missionary surgeon to   India. He tells the story of his mother who was a missionary in   India and who did something that symbolizes a life devoted through   suffering to the glory of God and not self. Dr. Brand writes,       For Mother, pain was a frequent companion, as was sacrifice. I   say it kindly and in love, but in old age, Mother had little of   physical beauty left in her. The rugged conditions, combined with   the crippling falls and her battles with typhoid, dysentery, and   malaria, had made her a thin, hunched-over old woman. Years of   exposure to wind and sun hand toughened her facial skin into   leather and furrowed it with wrinkles as deep and extensive as any   I have seen on a human face. . . Mother knew that as well as   anyone -- for the last t 20 years of her life she refused to keep   a mirror in her house. (Christianity Today, Jan. 10, 1994, p. 23)       Twenty years of ministry without a mirror. Do you get it? She   was the mirror. God was the light and the glory       6. Finally, keep on rejoicing because your Creator is faithful   to care for your soul.       Verse 19: "Therefore, let those also who suffer according to   the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing   what is right."       The degrees of suffering and the forms of affliction will   differ for every one of us. But one thing we will all have in   common till Jesus comes: we will all die. We will come to that   awesome moment of reckoning. If you have time you will see your   whole life played before you as you ponder if it has been   well-spent. You will tremble at the unspeakable reality that in   just moments you will face God. And the destiny of your soul will   be irrevocable.       Will you rejoice in that hour? You will if you entrust your   soul to a faithful Creator. He created your soul for his glory. He   is faithful to that glory and to all who love it and live for it.   Now is the time to show where your treasure is -- in heaven or on   earth. Now is the time to shine with the glory of God. Trust him.   And keep on rejoicing.
