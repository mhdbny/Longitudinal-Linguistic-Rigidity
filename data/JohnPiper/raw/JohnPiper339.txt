 January 12, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       ANGELS AND PRAYER:    DANIEL'S EXPERIENCE AND OURS    (Daniel 10)        This chapter is the clearest reference in all the Bible to what   people today are calling "territorial spirits." I want you to be   aware of what is happening today in this realm of spiritual   warfare, and I want us to think Biblically about it. I don't want   us to have our head in the sand as God awakens the church to   spiritual realities long overlooked. And I don't want us to be   naive in believing everything we hear, or lopsided in letting a   secondary Biblical truth become a primary preoccupation.        I believe that territorial spirits are real, as they turn up in   Daniel 10, and that they exist today. How then should we think   about them? How do they fit in with other Biblical truth? How   should we pray in view of their reality? That's my goal this   morning        Before we look at Daniel let me give you a taste of the kind of   thing that is happening today. Peter Wagner just published a book   called  Engaging the Enemy: How to Fight and Defeat Territorial   Spirits . He believes that as we move into the '90s the Holy   Spirit is calling the church to a spiritual warfare with   territorial spirits--evil spirits, demons, principalities, powers,   world rulers of this present darkness, spiritual hosts of   wickedness in the heavenly places (Eph. 6:12)--which attach   themselves to specific territories or regimes or institutions.        His assessment is that in the 1950's God began to ripen a   harvest of souls as he put evangelism high on the church's agenda.   In the 1960's God pressed the issues of compassion for the poor   and oppressed on the conscience of the church. In the 1970's there   were the first seeds of the growing prayer movement around the   world. And in the 1980's, with the third wave, there has been a   great emphasis on supernatural power in ministry, especially gifts   relating to prophecy and healing. As we enter the 1990's Peter   Wagner sees spiritual warfare with territorial spirits moving to   the forefront.        Of course, spiritual warfare is not new. But the way   territorial spirits are being confronted seems to be new. For   example, in Cordoba, Argentina 200 Youth With a Mission   missionaries gathered from around the world to tell fans at the   World Cup (soccer play-offs) about Jesus. But no one seemed to be   listening to their good news. Their evangelism efforts were   listless and powerless; their Spanish tracts were ignored.        The missionaries decided to devote a day to prayer and fasting.   In that meeting God revealed that Satan was not only busy with   individuals, but that he had immersed himself deeply into the   culture of the territory--especially in the form of pride. Cordoba   was very sophisticated, fashion-conscious and materialistic, and   the people clung to their values of position, possessions, and   appearance. The missionaries discerned that the only way this   "territorial spirit" manifesting itself in pride would be overcome   was by humility.        So they scattered themselves throughout the central mall   shopping area and got down on their knees with their foreheads to   the cobblestones in full view of passers-by and prayed for Jesus   to be revealed to the city.        A breakthrough came immediately. Large curious crowds gathered   to watch and listen. People took the tracts eagerly and even asked   to have them autographed by the missionaries. John Dawson preached   at the Plaza of St. Martin, and people in the crowd dropped to   their knees repenting of their sins. His interpretation of what   happened was that "the intimidation of the enemy was broken along   with our pride."        In other words, the way many are doing spiritual warfare today   is by moving into an area, seeking to discern supernaturally the   spirit that Satan has assigned to oppress and blind and control   the area, and then specifically serving notice on that spirit that   Jesus Christ is triumphant in this place and breaking its   spiritual hold on the region. S. D. Gordon said 90 years ago,   "Intercession is winning the victory over the chief, and service   is taking the field after the chief is driven off." That's the   strategy that many seem to be applying today with a direct focus   on territorial spirits.        Let's look at Daniel 10 to see what it will teach us about   these things.        Daniel receives a word from the Lord in verse 1--a vision of   conflict that stunned him with its greatness. Verse 1b says that   he understood it. But verse 12 it says that when he received the   vision he set himself to understand it. I take this to mean that   the general structure of the vision was clear to him, but the   meaning of its parts was not clear to him.        So Daniel set himself with tears and fasting and prayer to seek   the meaning of the vision, and for three weeks he wrestled in   prayer over this vision and sought to know God's will. Verse 2:   "In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. I ate no   delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint   myself at all, for the full three weeks."        After three weeks he went out to the banks of the Tigris River   (v. 4). There he had a vision that was so awesome he could hardly   bear it. Verse 5: "I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a   man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz.   His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of   lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like   the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the   noise of a multitude."        In other words, his single voice sounded like the roars at the   Metrodome. This appearance was so terrifying and so powerful that   (according to verse 7) even the men who were with Daniel, who   could not see the vision, trembled and ran away to hide themselves   from whatever it was. Verses 8-9 says that Daniel lost his color,   had no strength in him and fell on his face.        To make matters worse (in v. 10) a hand reached out and touched   him so that he shook terribly on his hands and knees. Then the   voice said (v. 11): "O Daniel, man greatly beloved, give heed to   the words that I speak to you, and stand up right, for now I have   been sent to you." Then he went on and said (v. 12): "Fear not,   Daniel, for from the first day that you set your mind to   understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words   (prayer!) have been heard, and I have come because of your   words."        Now this is immensely important for understanding prayer.   Notice the words: "I have come because of your words." Put that   together with the words in verse 11: "I have been sent to you."   That is, God sent him. So the point is that God answered your   prayer as soon as you began to pray three weeks ago. "From the   first day that you humbled yourself before your God your words   (your prayers!) have been heard, and I have come because of your   words (your prayer!)."        So this heavenly being has come because Daniel prayed and   humbled himself before God and fasted. And the three week delay   was not because God took three weeks to hear. What was it   then?        Verse 13: "The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me   twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to   help me." The reason the messenger of God was detained is because   a spiritual being called "the prince of the kingdom of Persia"   stood against him. And the reason this angelic messenger got free   from this opposition was because the angel Michael came to help   him.        This is the clearest example in all the Bible of what is called   today a "territorial spirit." Verse 13 refers to "The prince of   the kingdom of Persia." The natural meaning of this phrase would   be that among the supernatural beings opposed to God some at least   one is assigned to a territory or, more accurately, to a kingdom,   namely, Persia. Presumably his job is to darken the people of   Persia--to keep them from having the truth and the light of God's   word.        But this spirit is not the only one mentioned. Look at verse   20-21: "Then &#91;the messenger from God&#93; said, 'Do you know   why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the   prince of Persia; and when I am through with him, lo, the prince   of Greece will come. But I will tell you what is inscribed in the   book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these   except Michael, your prince."        So the messenger is going back to fight against the prince of   the kingdom of Persia and defeat him. And then there will appear   on the scene another great enemy spirit, the prince of Greece. In   other words, as different kingdoms rise and fall different demonic   spirits hold sway and have to be dealt with by God's messengers in   accomplishing his purposes.        So it appears that there was a spirit over Persia and a spirit   over Greece. But it also seems that Michael, the good angel, has   some special assignment for Israel. Because it says at the end of   verse 21: "Michael, your prince." And the "your" there is plural   in Hebrew. This is not a reference to Daniel's guardian angel, but   to Israel's guardian angel.        So I conclude from this that there is good Biblical reason for   thinking that there are powerful evil spirits with special   appointments from Satan over kingdoms like Persia and Greece. In   Luke 4:6 the devil took Jesus up and showed him all the kingdoms   of the world and then tempts him with these words: "To you I will   give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered   to me, and I give it to whom I will." He has an inflated notion of   his power in relation to the sovereignty of God. But under God it   is true that Satan is "the god of this world" (2 Cor. 4:4). And it   is probably true that he gives his power to those who worship him   (cf. Rev. 13:2). He is the "prince of demons" (Mark 3:22).        Since the New Testament tells us that this prince of demons   "darkens the minds of unbelievers" (2 Cor. 4:4), and that he   "deceives the world" (Rev. 12:9), and that he plants his weeds   (unbelievers) throughout the world (Matt. 13:39), and that he   takes people captive to do his will (2 Tim. 2:25), and that he   plucks up the seed of the word when it is preached (Matt. 13:4),   and that he thwarts missionary activity (1 Thess. 2:18), and that   he throws ministers in prison (Rev. 2:10)--since we know the   prince of demons does all that, we may conclude with good reason   that this is what his sub-princes do as well.        So then, I would conclude that there are high-ranking demonic   powers over various regimes and dominions and governments and   realms of the world; and that they work to create as much evil and   corruption and spiritual darkness as they can. They strive to   interrupt Christian missions and ministry as much as they can.        That is why the prince of the kingdom of Persia tried to hinder   the messenger from reaching Daniel from heaven. The messenger was   bringing a message of truth. Verse 21: the messenger says to   Daniel, "But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of   truth." But Satan is a liar and a deceiver from the beginning. The   main aim of all his princes is to keep the book of truth from   being known and believed. The truth frees people (John 8:32) and   sanctifies people (John 17:17). So the territorial spirits like   the prince of the kingdom of Persia do their main work of   corruption and destruction by blinding the people of their area   from the truth.        How then shall we do ministry in view of this reality of   "territorial spirits"?        1. Take the supernatural seriously and realize that we are in a   warfare that cannot and should not be domesticated by   reinterpreting everything in the Biblical world view so that it   fits nicely with secular, naturalistic ways of thinking about the   world. Be ready for the extraordinary as well as the ordinary ways   that evil spirits work. Don't be presumptuous, as though demons   were weak; and don't be anxious, as though they were stronger than   Jesus.        Be filled with the Spirit and well armed with Biblical promises   about the authority of Jesus Christ and about your rights as a   child of God*. Remember that two times in our text the messenger   from heaven said to Daniel "O man greatly loved." The word means   "desired" or "precious". He said this to take away Daniel's fear   in the midst of spiritual warfare. And it should take away ours   too.        2. The second thing is to notice that Daniel's prayer that has   such powerful effects in the spiritual realm was not a prayer   about angels and territorial spirits. He was wrestling for truth   and for the good of God's people the way we saw him praying last   week. He was totally shocked when an angel appeared to him. And he   knew nothing about the conflict with the prince of the kingdom of   Persia.        But it's no accident that the messenger said that his struggle   with the prince of Persian lasted exactly the same amount of time   that Daniel's fasting and prayer did (cf. vv. 2, 13)--21 days. The   reason for this is that the warfare in the spirit realm was being   fought in a real sense by Daniel in the prayer realm.        And so it is with more of our prayers than we realize. But the   point is this: Daniel's praying was not about angels. And probably   ours shouldn't be either. We should wrestle in prayer and fasting   for the things that we know are God's will in our lives and our   families and our church and our city and our world. But by and   large we should probably leave it to God how he will use angels to   get his work done. If God shows us more, we will use it. But the   essence of the matter is not knowing the spirits but knowing God   and praying in the power of Holy Spirit.        So let us be about it with all our might this year. May the   Lord make us a people who pray like Daniel.        Copyright 1992 John Piper     Piper's   Notes
