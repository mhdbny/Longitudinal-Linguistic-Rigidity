Good news to the poor.   We willdevelop new strategies  for proclaiming the all-satisfying supremacy of God&#146;s loveand justice to the poor  through 1) personal involvement; 2) a more welcoming atmosphere;3) local missionary  strategies of urban disciple making; and 4) equipping missionariesfor unreached urban  peoples.     Introduction: Spreading a Passion...     This morning we continue our unfolding ofthe Fresh Initiatives of  the Bethlehem Mission and Vision Statement. Keep in mind why weexist: we exist to  spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for thejoy of all peoples.  I wonder if it has hit you that the word spreaddefines us as a people on a  mission for others. We used to define Bethlehem by saying:Bethlehem is a vision of  God and we exist to savor that vision in worship and strengthenthat vision in nurture and  spread that vision in evangelism and world missions. Noticethe new priority given  to the word spread. We exist to spread a passionfor the supremacy of  God in all things for the joy of all peoples.     You may ask, What about savoring thevision of God. What has  become of that priority? Answer: It&#146;s in the wordpassion --  passion   for the supremacy of God. The supremacy of God is thevision we have of him. And  our  passion  for this is our  savoring  of him and thevision we have of him.  What we have then in our new mission statement is a declaration ofGod&#146;s supremacy  over all things magnified and savored in the wordpassion rocketed off of this  launching pad with the word spread. In other words,the word the lead word  spread signals a fresh commitment -- not that we valuesavoring  and strengthening the vision of the supremacy of Godless than we used to --  but that we value it so much we WILL NOT keep it to ourselves.    Savoring the supremacy of God   as an endin himself   --  being satisfied with all that God is for us in Jesus -- is so goodthat we cannot keep it  to ourselves. Or: The supremacy of God that we savor in worship isthe very supremacy that  he exerts in saving my neighbor. And if I have a passion to seeand savor that supremacy  of God -- as an end in itself -- I must speak it and show it to myneighbor. Hence the  preeminence of the word spread.    There is a new way to say the mission ofBethlehem, because God is  creating new passions in our hearts.     Bethlehem and the Reality of Poverty     This new preeminence given tospreading our passion for  the supremacy of God leads us to Fresh Initiative #5:         We will develop new strategies forproclaiming the all-satisfying    supremacy of God&#146;s love and justice to the poor through 1)personal involvement; 2) a    more welcoming atmosphere; 3) local missionary strategies ofurban disciple making; and 4)    equipping missionaries for unreached urban peoples.       What is behind this Initiative? Why does itrank among the six fresh  priorities on page 3 of the mission/vision statement booklet?    First some facts from the world and then somefacts from the Word:    Poverty is a problem out of control in a worldthat now has the highest  standard of living of any time in history.           800,000,000 people live in absolutepoverty.            70,000,000 are on the threshold ofstarvation, every day.            Another 400,000,000 consume less than theminimum critical      diet.             The infant mortality rate is 14% in thepoorest third of the world as      compared with 1% in the richest third of the world.             Half of the children of the absolute poordo not live to be 5.            There are 125,000,000 infant deaths aweek, most preventable with      simple medical care or hygiene.            The poor who survive the first few yearswill, on average, die before      the age of 47, while in our third of the world we will live anaverage of 26 years longer.                  13% of the poorest third of the worldwill learn to read as compared      with 90% of our society.             The average person in the poorest thirdof the world will earn about      $300.00 this year, while the average person in the richestthird of the world will earn      about $18,000.00            Half of the least developed countries arealso the least evangelized      countries. The other half have very few Christians.             One study of poverty and spiritual needexpressed this observation:         The most dominant impression one gains fromlooking at the world in    this way is that the poor are the lost and the lost are thepoor. Whether one approaches    the data from a desire to learn where the Good News needs to beheard, or a desire to find    the poorest of the poor, the answer is the same.       What is our response to these global realities?You need to know that  one of the effects that these realities has on me is to incline meaway from finery and  the symbols of wealth. I try to keep the destitution and sufferingof the world before me.  I keep records of these things. I ponder them and hold them beforemy mind. Because I fear  the inoculating effects of wealth and of fine culture on me. Inother words, for me, the  more I take the lost and desperate condition of the worldseriously, the more  uncomfortable I feel with the symbols of wealth and refinementthat tend to distance me  from the poor -- including 195,000,000 Christian brothers andsisters in the least  developed countries. I say this simply to let you know that thoseimpulses are at work in  me, and have an impact on my life and the way I feel called to dochurch.    Don&#146;t conclude from this that I naivelythink that the solution to  poverty is for all of us to toss out our refrigerators andcomputers, take the bus, and  close down the universities. Nobody is going to be helped by usturning our backs on the  refined achievements of modern technology. In fact these thingsneed to be used with big  hearts and big discernment for the sake of the poor. But I dobelieve that if we could all  spend a year in Dhaka, Bangladesh or Calcutta, India the way wethink and feel about  finery would be profoundly affected. I urge to keep theserealities in the circle of your  awareness, lest you become anesthetized by American abundance andaffluence.    And, of course, poverty is not just a distantthing. And, even though  its a relative thing, it is close to home. Take Philipsneighborhood for example. In 1990  17,000 people lived there, where I live. The median householdincome was $12,254. The  percent of the population living in poverty was 48.9%. In 1992slightly more than half the  children in Minneapolis (not just Philips) were receiving economicassistance. And 75% of  those were living in female headed families. Whichtells us one thing about  the value for kids of durable marriages. I only mention these fewstatistics to let you  know that there are realities of poverty staring us in the faceclose to home as well as  in the underdeveloped countries of the world.    If our mission is to spread a passion for thesupremacy of God in the  salvation of the lost, what does the staggering reality of povertyimply? The study quoted  above concluded like this:         If [globally speaking] the lost are the poor,and the poor are the    lost, then a holistic ministry, one in which compassion, socialtransformation, and    proclamation are inseparably related, would seem to be thestrategy for this time in human    history. If incarnation is the model practiced by the One whoministered to such as these,    then holistic practitioners, people whose lives are eloquentconcerning the values and    worth of the Gospel, would seem to be the messengers of thehour.       This is the conviction behind Fresh Initiative#5 -- proclaiming good  news to the poor. And, like most of the other Initiatives, thistrain is already moving.  God has not waited for us to get it all together here. He ischanging us in this  incarnational direction, and he has burdened many of you to liveand minister among the  poor. Many of our missionaries work among the poor. Jim and RaquelBloom have moved into  the Gate House on a mission of discipling among the urban poor at2910 Bloomington Ave.  And the evangelistic cell-group in this connection just dividedinto two. Not to mention  the ministries of Masterworks and involvement at Elliot Twins andMarie Sandvig and  others.    The train is already moving. And one of theclearest signs that God is  in this is that he is doing the vision before we doany pushing.    What I would like to do then is simply awakenyou to the Biblical  pattern of care about the poor, with the prayer that God wouldmake it a priority in our  Christian living and ministry.     Remember the Poor     In Galatians 2:9-10 Paul tells us about thetime he and Barnabas  met with Peter James and John to come to terms about the gospel.The upshot of that  meeting was unity of purpose and different missions. Here&#146;sthe way Paul recorded it:            James and Cephas and John . . . gave tome and Barnabas the right    hand of fellowship, that we  might go  to theGentiles, and they to the    circumcised. (10)  They  only asked  us to remember the    poor-- the very thing I also was eager to do.        Isn&#146;t it remarkable that out all thethings Paul could have chosen  to highlight the one he chose was that both major apostolic bands -- the Paul circle and  the Peter circle -- ended their summit meeting with the agreementthat in all their work  remembering the poor would have an essential place. That says tome: make this ministry  essential.    Why is that? Well there are some evidences thatGod himself has a  special merciful blessing for the poor. For example, in James 2:2-5 James is tackling the  problem of partisanship toward the rich in the church. One of thereasons he gives why  this is so wrong is that God&#146;s orientation to the poor isvery different:          For if a man comes into your assembly with agold ring and dressed in    fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirtyclothes, 3 and you pay special    attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say,You sit here in a    good place, and you say to the poor man, You standover there, or sit down by    my footstool, 4 have you not made distinctions amongyourselves, and become judges    with evil motives? 5 Listen, my beloved brethren:  did not Godchoose the poor of this    world  to be  rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom whichHe promised to those who    love Him?            So it appears that God intends to turn ournatural bent upside down by  bringing poor people to faith. They don&#146;t give as much toyour church, and they  don&#146;t make a splash in the media. And so they don&#146;tgratify the lust of the  flesh and the pride of life (1 John 2:16). So God calls them.    And Jesus told   us   to call them.In Luke 14 he said,           Go out at once into the streets and lanesof the city and bring in    here the poor and crippled and blind and lame. . . When you givea reception, invite the    poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will beblessed, since they do not have    the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at theresurrection of the righteous (Luke    14:21; 14:13-14).        And this command fit in with his whole ministry-- which is what  Christmas is all about too-- namely, his incarnation. He movedfrom infinite wealth to  poverty and finally destitution for the sake of our salvation. 2Corinthians 8:9 puts it  like this:          For you know the grace of our Lord JesusChrist, that though He was    rich, yet for your sake He became poor, that you through Hispoverty might become rich.       And when Paul pondered how that should affecthis own ministry strategy  he choose a lean, wartime, missionary way of life. In 2Corinthians 6:10 he describes  himself, poor, yet making many rich (Just like Jesus).In other words he chose  to do what Jesus did in coming to earth.    The fact that Jesus was born to a poor couplein a cow stall tells us  something about the way God meant to reach the world.     And when he entered his ministry he did twothings: he declared with is  mouth that he was sent to the poor; and he declared with his lifethat he would be among  the poor. In Luke 4:18 he said, The spirit of the Lord isupon me, because he  anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. And in Matthew8:20 he said, The  foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have   nests; butthe Son of Man has  nowhere to lay His head.    There are many more texts -- literally hundredsmore in the Bible --  that make an incarnational proclamation of the Gospel to the poora high priority. But  these are enough this morning to shed God&#146;s light on FreshInitiative #5. We will do  it, God helping us, by         1) personal involvement;      2) a more welcoming atmosphere;      3) local missionary strategies of urban disciple making; and      4) equipping missionaries for unreached urban peoples       May God give us a mind to dream and a heart tolove -- so that we  spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for thejoy of all peoples --  especially the poor.
