        OUT OF ZION, THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY, GOD SHINES FORTH    (Psalm 50:1-6)        The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from   the rising of the sun to its setting. Out of Zion, the perfection   of beauty, God shines forth. Our God comes, He does not keep   silence, before Him is a devouring fire, round about Him a mighty   tempest. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that He   may judge His people: "Gather to Me my faithful ones, who made a   covenant with Me by sacrifice!" The heavens declare His   righteousness, for God himself is judge!        I have two purposes in this message this morning. One is to   begin a three part series on this great Psalm. The other purpose   is to pick up on last week's text in Hebrews 13:14 which said,   "Here we have no lasting city, but we seek a city that is to   come." We talked about singing about "Zion city of our God" last   week, but decided that Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem and the   city to come are foreign ideas to most Christians today.        So we have decided to devote a message to this theme in   Scripture, namely, the theme of Zion and the city of God and the   new Jerusalem. We've sung the hymn        "Glorious things of thee are spoken,             Zion city of our God;              He whose word cannot be broken              Formed thee for His own abode.              On the Rock of Ages founded,              What can shake Thy sure repose?              With salvation's walls surrounded,              Thou mayest smile at all Thy foes."         When I think about the man who wrote that hymn I am encouraged   that this Biblical theme can become relevant and meaningful for   the most secular, unchurched, modern person in America. It was   written by John Newton, the same man who wrote Amazing Grace. He   was, by his own confession, a very corrupt young man. He ran from   his father and ran from the law and sailed the high seas. He ran a   slave trading vessel in the 1750's from the coasts of Africa.   Later on, he called himself "the old African blasphemer." In other   words, he is not the kind of person you would expect to use   Biblical words like "Zion" &#151; or to make up a song like   "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God."        You'd think that ideas like "Zion" and the heavenly Jerusalem   would be reserved for churchy types who spend all their time   reading the Bible and don't know much about the world. But that's   not true. It never has been true. It is not true today. The most   irreligious, immoral person you know is probably more religious   and more moral than John Newton was. Can you imagine that person   falling in love with the language of Zion &#151; unthinkable! Or   is it?        John Newton died December 31, 1807. He wrote his own epitaph   for his gravestone. It says, "John Newton, clerk, once an infidel   and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, was, by the rich   mercy of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, preserved, restored,   pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had long labored to   destroy."        Amazing grace, how sweet the sound             that saved a wretch like me,              I once was lost but now am found,              Was blind but now I see.         And one of the things this African blasphemer saw when God   saved him and opened his eyes was the beauty Zion. And I want you   to see it too, whoever you are this morning.        "Verse 2 of our text says, "Out of Zion, the perfection of   beauty, God shines forth." We will talk more next week about the   setting, the scene of judgment, and why God is calling the heavens   and the earth to listen to His judgment over Israel. But today I   want us just to focus on this term Zion. "Out of Zion, the   perfection of beauty, God shines forth." What is Zion? And why is   it such a rich and hope-filled word for Christians?        Let's begin back where the word is used for the first time in   the Bible (2&yuml;Samuel&yuml;5:7). It says of David, "The king   and his men went to Jerusalem against the   Jebusites...&#91;and&#93; David took the stronghold of Zion, that   is, the city of David." So from the time of David, Zion was   synonymous with the city of David.        What begins to make this place so significant is that   immediately (in 2&yuml;Samuel&yuml;6:12) David brings the ark of   the covenant into to this stronghold of Zion. The ark of the   covenant was the sacred seat of the holy of holies where God met   His people in the tabernacle. So Zion becomes the center of   worship and of God's presence. And when Solomon moves the arc of   the covenant into the temple that he had built   (1&yuml;Kings&yuml;8:1), the whole of Jerusalem came to be known   as Zion.        So most of the time (in its 150+ uses in the Old Testament)   "Zion" refers to the city of Jerusalem, not just as another name,   but because it is the city of God's presence and the city of great   hope for God's people.        Let me illustrate this significance with some texts.        Psalm 51:18, "Do good to Zion in Thy good pleasure; rebuild the   walls of Jerusalem." (Zion is Jerusalem.)        Psalm 9:11, "Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion! Tell   among the peoples His deeds." (So Zion is the place on earth where   God has chosen to makes His presence especially known. Psalm   78:67f)        Psalm 74:2, "Remember mount Zion, where Thou hast dwelt." (It   is called a mount because David's stronghold and then the temple   were on mountains or hills in Jerusalem.)        So Zion meant the place where God was present and near to His   people. But that's not all. It follows that the Zion became the   place from which the people expected help. Zion became the source   of deliverance and salvation. For example,        Psalm 20:2, "May the Lord send you help from the sanctuary, and   give you support from Zion!"        Psalm 3:4, "I cry aloud to the Lord, and He answers me from His   holy hill" &#151; that is, Mount Zion.        So Zion was the place of God's special presence among His   people and it was the place where they could get help and   deliverance.        But because sin became rampant among the people and because   divine judgment was inevitable, even on Zion (Lamentations 2:15),   it became more and more obvious, especially to the prophets that   Zion, the city of David, the earthly Jerusalem was not the ideal   city. They began to see more clearly that this Zion pointed   forward to a future Zion and upward to a heavenly Zion. Or to put   it another way, if imperfect Zion is the place of God's presence   on the earth, then there must be a perfect Zion where God dwells   in heaven (cf. Acts&yuml;7:48f). And if imperfect Zion is the   place of God's presence on the earth now, then all the promises of   complete and perfect reign on the earth must mean that there will   some day be a new and ideal Zion on the earth where God rules over   all the nations. In other words the old Jerusalem points upward to   a heavenly Zion, and forward to a future Zion.        Let me show you this from some scriptures. First some pointers   to the future Zion.        Isaiah 24:23, "The moon will be confounded, and the sun   ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in   Jerusalem." The Lord will reign on Mount Zion!        Micah 4:6f, "In that day, says the Lord, I will assemble the   lame...and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion from this   time forth and for evermore."        Isaiah 2:2f, "It shall come to pass in the latter days that the   mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the   highest of the mountains...; and all the nations shall flow to   it&#133; For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of   the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between nations, and shall   decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into   plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks..."        So the Bible teaches that there is coming a day when the Lord   will rule over the nations from His seat in Zion. And there will   be peace and righteousness. I believe this is what the Bible means   by the Millennium &#151; a thousand year reign of God on the earth   from Mount Zion. "I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill" (Psalm   2:6). So the old Jerusalem points forward to a glorious future   Zion from which God will reign on earth.        But the Old Testament points not only to a future, glorious   Zion where God will reign on earth, it also points to a heavenly   Zion where God already reigns now. This is not so easy to see, but   once we see, it becomes really precious to us who live far from   the earthly Jerusalem and are not even Jews.        There are a few key passages that show this. One is Psalm   87.        On the holy mount stands the city He founded; the Lord loves   the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.   Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. (This is where   John Newton got his song. Now the Lord himself speaks concerning   the true citizens of Zion:) Among those who know me I mention   Rahab (=Egypt) and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with   Ethiopia (So he foretells the day when these pagan nations will   turn and know God. And then he describes them as natural born   citizens of Zion) &#151; "This one was born there," they say. And   of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in   her"; for the Most High himself will establish her. The Lord   records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born   there."        This is an amazing Psalm! If Zion is the place of God's   presence, if Zion is the place of God's power and blessing and   protection, if Zion is the hope of God's future rule over the   earth, then what is the hope of us Gentiles? What about us who pay   our taxes in Minneapolis and St. Paul and Roseville and Eagan and   Bloomington and New Brighton, and have never even seen Jerusalem,   let alone become a citizen of God's city? What about us whom Paul   says are separated from the commonwealth of Israel and have no   citizenship in Zion the city of God (Ephesians 2:12)?        The answer is that there is a Zion whose citizenship is not   earthly. Psalm 87:5 says the Most High himself is establishing   this Zion by declaring with sovereign freedom and with saving   effect: "This one was born there." This one in Minneapolis was   born in Zion. This one in Moscow was born in Zion. This one in   Jakarta was born in Zion. This one in Kankan was born in Zion. God   is populating Zion with foreigners of every people and tribe and   tongue and nation.        But how can this be? What does it mean? It means that there is   a true Zion in heaven, there is a heavenly Jerusalem. And the true   people of God, whether Jew or Gentile, are citizens there. To   belong to the people of God your birth certificate has to say,   "This one was born in Zion."        But what does this mean in New Testament terms? Galatians 4:26   says something amazingly similar: "The Jerusalem above is free,   and she is our mother." We have been conceived and born in the   heavenly Jerusalem. In other words we have all been born once in   some earthly city. And that birth has simply made us flesh and   blood and given us a citizenship in some country here on earth.   But if we want to know God and be with God in his city, if we want   to be a part of that future kingdom of peace and joy and love and   righteousness where God rules from Zion, then we have to be born   from above. We have to have a second, spiritual birth. We have to   have our citizenship in heaven (Philippians&yuml;3:20) and in the   Jerusalem above. Our second birth certificate has to say, "This   one was born in Zion." "Truly, truly I say to you, unless a person   is born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John   3:3).        Hebrews 12:22 says to Christians, to those who trust Christ,   "You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,   the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal   gathering and to the assembly of the first born, who are enrolled   in heaven."        Notice the verse says, "You have come to Mount Zion..." Not:   you will come. But you HAVE COME. One of the great things about   being a Christian is that when you are born again, you don't have   to wonder any more if you are going to be a part of the city of   God. Those who are born from above have ALREADY COME to Mount   Zion; they are ALREADY enrolled in the heavenly Jerusalem; they   are ALREADY citizens of the city of God. Paul said to those who   had surrendered to Jesus, "You have died and your life is hid with   Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you will   appear with him in glory" (Colossians 3:3).        So it is with the Zion, the city of God. If you trust Christ   you are already a permanent citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem. And   when this new Jerusalem appears, you will be there too in   glory.        I want to close this message the way the Bible closes, with an   invitation to any who have never come to Mount Zion, the city of   God, the new Jerusalem &#151; perhaps a John Newton in our midst.   The last two chapters of the Bible describe the new Jerusalem,   coming down from heaven at the end of the age.        * It is adorned like a bride for her husband.             * In it every tear is wiped away, there is no more death, or      crying or pain.              * Its radiance is like a rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as      crystal.              * There is no temple in the city because the temple is the      Lord God the Almighty and Jesus Christ the Lamb.              * There is no sun or moon to shine, because the glory of God      himself is its light and the lamp is the Lamb.              * At the center of the city is the throne of God and flowing      out from the throne is a river of the water of life.              * And on either side of the river is the tree of life that      bears fruit for ever.              * And behold the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell      with them and they shall be His people and He will be their God      and their light and their joy, and they shall reign for ever      and ever.         The Spirit and the Brides say, "Come." And let him who hears   say, "Come." And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires   take the water of life without price" (Revelation&yuml;22:17). "To   the thirsty I will give from the fountain of the water of life   without payment." (21:6) COME!        
        Further Notes        * More on the idea of being born in Zion and the reach      of Zion to all the nations: Isaiah 66:8; Zechariah 2:11f.             * More on the heavenly Zion in the Old Testament: Psalm      48:2; compare the phrase "far north" (not in NIV!) to the same      phrase in Isaiah 14:13f. Zion seems to be pictured here as in      the very distant north, namely in the heavenly realm.              * For the great future rejoicing in Zion see Isaiah 35:10;      51:3,11.              * The hope of the city with foundations is a strong      incentive to suffer and love here: Hebrews&yuml;13:13f;      10:10,16; Revelation 3:12.
