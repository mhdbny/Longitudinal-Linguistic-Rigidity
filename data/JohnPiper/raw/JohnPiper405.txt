  April 17, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       CHRISTIAN IDENTITY AND CHRISTIAN DESTINY    (1 Peter 2:9-10)        But you are a chosen race, a royalpriesthood, a holy      nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may      proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of      darkness into His marvelous light; for you once were not a      people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received      mercy, but now you have receivedmercy.         Introduction: the wonder of being human       One day last week I when Noel and I were praying together I   found myself thanking God for the wonder of being a human. We have   the astonishing capacity to see and hear and feel, and then to   think about all this amazing reality, and then to form judgments   about it all and know right and wrong and good and bad and   beautiful and ugly, and then to feel profound emotions of love and   hate and joy and discouragement and wonder and hope and gratitude,   and then to reason and plan our lives in ways that accomplish   things. And best of all is to find all these wonderful human   capacities caught up in knowing and loving and serving the   greatest Being in the universe -- our Maker and our Savior and our   God. It was one of those rare moments -- like a brief brush with   eternity.       One of the great benefits of having a dog is the increased   awareness that I am not one. I look at our dog, Sable, and think   for a moment that she is kind and forgiving and humble and patient   and loving and warm and gentle and happy and peaceful. Then I   realize she's a dog! She does not know or reason or feel or judge   like I do. She does not prize anything because of its true worth   -- its relation to God. She doesn't know where she came from. She   doesn't reflect on her identity and wonder who she is or what it   means ultimately in God's scheme of things to be a dog. She   doesn't think about why she's here and doesn't know where she's   going.       She is a wonder, and can call forth amazing affection. But she   is not a human created in the image of God. And as I think about   her I am amazed at my own humanity. And at the incredible wonders   of the humans I live with. To be alive as a human being with   indescribable mysteries at every turn, and to have in front of us   an eternal destiny of spectacular glory or inexpressible horror is   a weight that can either press you down with fear and trembling or   bear you up with joy unspeakable and full of glory.       Whether it does the one or the other depends in large measure   on whether you know the answer to the big basic human questions or   not. Who are you? How did you get that identity? What are you here   for? No dog or turtle or fish or squirrel or bird or dolphin or   chimpanzee ever lost one night's sleep pondering those questions.   Only humans ask these questions. Only humans kill themselves and   kill others when they don't get true and satisfying answers to   these questions.       Not often do we find such resoundingly clear answers to all   three questions in such a small space as we do in this text this   morning. Who am I? How did I get this identity? What's it for --   Why am I here?       So let's take a deep breath this morning and go back to the   beginning as it were -- or go down to the rock bottom foundational   questions of life, and listen to the Word of God and wonder and   stand in awe of what he has to say about these three things.       Who are you?       Keep in mind that Peter is identifying Christians. This is who   you are if you are a Christian. This is how you got your identity   as a Christian. This is what you are here for as a Christian.       First, he gives five ways of describing your identity,   answering the question of who you are.       







1. Verse 9: You   are a chosen race.       I know that this is a corporate identity, he's talking about   the church -- the true Israel. But the implication is individual,   because this race is not racial. The chosen race is not black or   white or red or yellow or brown. The chosen race is a new people   from all the peoples -- all the colors and cultures -- who are now   aliens and strangers among in the world. See verse 11, "Beloved, I   urge you as aliens and strangers . . ."       What gives us our identity is not color or culture. But   chosenness. Christians are not the white race; they are the chosen   race. Christians are not the black race; they are the chosen race.   We are the black chosen and the white chosen and the yellow chosen   and the red chosen. Out from all the races we have been chosen --   one at a time, not on the basis of belonging to any group.       That's why this amazing phrase is individually crucial for you;   you are part of the "chosen race" because the race is made up of   individuals who were chosen -- from all the races. So your first   identity is that you are chosen. God chose you. Not because of   your race -- or for any other qualification -- God chose you. Who   am I? I am chosen. I do not know why. It was nothing in me of   value above other humans. I did not earn it or merit it, or meet   any conditions to get it. It happened before I was born. I stand   in awe of it. I tremble with joy at it. I bow and accept it. I   long to be faithful to its purpose. I am chosen.       2. You are pitied. Verse 10b: ". . . you had not received   mercy, but now you have received mercy."       I choose the word "pitied" because the word for mercy in Greek   here is a verb and the closest word we have in English like   "mercied" is "pitied." It's not a bad translation. When God chose   us, he then saw us in our sin and guilt and condemnation and he   pitied us. We are not just chosen. We are pitied. We are the not   just the objects of his choice, but the objects of his mercy.       I am chosen and I am pitied -- or you could say I am "graced."   I am "loved." God did not just choose me and stand aloof. He chose   me and then drew near in mercy to help me and save me. My identity   is fundamentally this: I have been shown mercy. I am a "mercied"   person. I get my identity not first from my actions, but from   being acted upon -- with pity. I am a pitied one.       3. You are God's possession. This is expressed twice. Verse 9:   "You are . . . a people for God's own possession." Verse 10a: "You   once were not a people, but now you are the people of God."       You are chosen by God; you are pitied by God; and the effect of   that pity -- that mercy -- is that God takes you to be his own   possession. Now God owns everything. So in one sense everyone is   God's possession. So this must means something special. And, of   course, it does. You are God's inheritance. You are the ones he   aims to spend eternity with. When God says (in 2 Cor. 6:16), "I   will be their God and they will be my people (my possession),"   what he means is that "I will dwell in them and walk among them."       You are chosen; you are pitied; you are God's possession -- the   ones he will walk among and reveal himself to in a personal   relation forever.       







4. You are   holy. Verse 9: "You are a . . . holy nation."       You have been chosen and pitied and possessed by God; and   therefore you are not merely part of the world any more. You are   set apart for God. You exist for God. And since God is holy, you   are holy. You share his character, because he chose you, pitied   you, possessed you. You are holy. If you do not act in a holy way,   you act out of character. You contradict your essence as a   Christian. For your identity is holiness to the Lord: you are   holy.       5. And finally, you are a royal priest. Verse 9: "You are a ...   royal priesthood."       You are chosen by God and pitied by God and possessed by God   and holy like God and royal priests to God. The point here is   first that you have immediate access to God -- you don't need   another human priest as a mediator. God himself provided the one   Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ. You have direct access   to God, through God. And, second, you have an exalted, active role   in God's presence. You are not chosen, pitied, possessed, and holy   just to fritter away your time doing nothing. You are called now   to minister in the presence of God. All your life is priestly   service. You are never out of God's presence. You are never in a   neutral zone. You are always in the court of the temple. And your   life is either a spiritual service of worship (Rom. 12:1-2), or it   is out of character.       So you can see that your identity -- the question , "Who are   you?" -- leads directly to the question, "What are you here for?".   Your identity leads to your destiny. You are chosen, pitied,   possessed, and holy -- all for a purpose -- to minister as   priests. And the heart of that ministry Peter describes for us   very clearly.       







How did I get   this identity?       But before we answer the question what we are here for, let's   pause just a moment and answer the middle question: How did I get   this identity?       The answer is almost too obvious. We got our identity from God.   In fact our identity is our relation to God. We are chosen by GOD.   We are pitied by GOD. We are possessed by GOD. We are set apart as   holy by GOD. We are invested as royal priests by GOD.       Peter says this in a summary statement at the end of verse 9.   He refers to God like this: "Him who has called you out of   darkness into His marvelous light." The light we live in his the   light of our being chosen and pitied and possessed and holy and   priestly. And the way we got there is that God called us. He   called us out of darkness into this marvelous light.       So the answer to the question: How did we get this identity is   that God gave it to us. He gave it to us by virtue of his   irresistible call. (I know that we were chosen by God before we   were called by God. So it might look like I'm not saying quite   right. But what I mean is that the experience of walking in the   light of being chosen -- the experience of that identity -- is the   effect of God's sovereign call.)       God gave us the identity we have.       What are we here for?       What we saw was that our identity led directly to our destiny:   we are chosen, pitied, possessed, and holy all for the sake of   being a royal priesthood. But Peter is more specific when he tells   us the precise reason for our existence. He says in verse 9:b that   we exist for this reason: "that you may proclaim the excellencies   of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous   light." This is the full-time destiny of a royal priest -- to make   the glories of the king known.       There is a lot of discussion in our day of self-concept or   self- identity. How do we view ourselves? It is an important   question. And what I hope you hear this morning is that the   specifically Biblical angle on this question is that Christian   selfhood is not defined in terms of who we are in and of   ourselves. It's defined in terms of what God does to us and the   relationship he creates with us and the destiny he appoints for   us. In other words as a Christian you cannot talk about your   identity without talking about the action of God on you, the   relationship of God with you and the purpose of God for you. The   Biblical understanding of human self-identity is radically   God-centered.       Our Identity: to make known God's identity       Who am I? Who are you? You are a God-chosen one, a God-pitied   one, a God-possessed one, a God-sanctified one. The very language   of our identity in this text necessitates that God be included as   the one who acts. Our identity is not an end in itself, but for   the sake of priestly service, which Peter defines as proclaiming   the excellencies of the One who called us out of darkness into his   marvelous light.       God made us who we are so that we might proclaim the excellency   of his freedom in choosing us. The excellency of his grace in   pitying us. The excellencies of his authority and power in   possessing us. The excellencies of his worth and purity in making   us holy.       In other words he has given us our identity in order that his   identity might be proclaimed through us. God made us who we are so   we could make known who he is. Our identity is for the sake of   making known his identity. The meaning of our identity is that the   excellency of God be seen in us.       Therefore being a Christian and making the greatness of God   known are almost identical. We can do it in church services with   preaching and singing and praying and reading. We can do it in our   small groups as we tell each other what God has been for us, or   what we need him to be for us. We can do it at work as we tell   people what we love about God and why we think he is great. And we   can do it in a thousand different ways of love that suit our   situation and personality.       For example, I'll close with this wonderful story of how Doug   Nichols, the International Director of Action International   Ministries, made the excellencies of God known in a tuberculosis   sanitarium in India in 1967 -- he was a missionary with Operation   Mobilization and got TB. He was in the sanitarium for several   months. He tried to give tracts and copies of the Gospel of John   away, but no one would take them. They didn't like him and assumed   he was a rich American.       At one point for several nights he would wake up coughing at 2   AM. He noticed a little old emaciated man trying to get out of   bed. The man couldn't stand up, and began to whimper. He lay back   into bed. In the morning the stench in the ward was terrible and   everyone was angry at the old man for not containing himself. The   nurse who cleaned up even smacked the old man for making such a   mess.       The next night the very same thing happened. Doug woke up   coughing with his own terrible sickness and weakness. He saw the   old man try again to get out of bed. Again he couldn't stand, and   began to cry softly. Doug got out of bed went over to the old man.   The man cowered with fear. But Doug picked him up with both arms   and carried him to the bathroom which was just a hole in the   floor, and then brought him back. The man kissed him on the cheek   as he put him down in bed.       At 4 AM another patient woke Doug with a steaming cup of tea   and made motions that said he wanted a copy of the booklet -- the   Gospel of John. Through that whole day people kept coming to him   and asking for his booklets even though he could not speak their   language.       In other words one way to declare the excellencies of God is to   act them out. When we act out the excellencies of God, people will   hear them with even greater eagerness. Which is just another way   of saying that our identity -- who we are -- is for the sake of   God. God made us who we are to show the world who he is.
