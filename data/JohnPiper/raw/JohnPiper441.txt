    June 4, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE     Love One Another with BrotherlyLove   (Romans 12:9-13)          Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor whatis evil; cling to what is    good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; givepreference to one another in    honor; not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,serving the Lord; rejoicing in    hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,...              Introduction: Tender Affection     We have spoken about loving our neighbor aswe love ourselves --  making our self-seeking the measure of our self-giving. Taking ourskin off and wrapping  around another person and seeing ourselves in them with all ourlongings and needs and  desires. And we have talked about loving our enemies, praying forour persecutors,  blessing those who curse us, returning good for evil.    Today we penetrate further into the relationalexperience that God  intends for his people. He intends for us not merely to   do  to others as we  would have them do to us, but he wants us to   feel  toward other believers a  certain way. It is true that love is more than feelings. It istrue that there are good  ways we should treat each other even when we are feeling upsetwith one another. But it is  not true to say that God is content with our treating each otherdecently while feeling  hard toward each other.     Let&#146;s look at the Scriptures that show usthis. Start in our text,  Romans 12:9-10,           Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor whatis evil; cling to what is    good. 10  Be devoted to one another in brotherly love ;give preference to one    another in honor.        Ponder that sentence, Be devoted to oneanother in brotherly  love.   Be devoted to one another,doesn&#146;t quite get the sense  of the original. The RSV says, Love one another withbrotherly affection. But  the word for love or be devoted refers toa special kind of love.  It&#146;s used only here in the whole New Testament. But it is nota rare word outside the  New Testament. It refers to tender affection, particularlyfamily affection  (C.E.B. Cranfield,  Romans , Vol. 2, p. 632). So what theverse is calling for is  that Christians have tender affection toward each other infamily love.    In C.S. Lewis&#146; book,  The FourLoves,  he says there are four  basic kinds of love. He gives them their Greek names:   agape  -- the God-like  self-giving love even toward enemies;   philia   -- thelove of friendship and  camaraderie;   eros   -- the love of romance and desireand sexual attraction;  and   storge   -- the love of affection that arisesthrough natural attachment,  a child, a dog, a favorite old shabby sweater, a spot in thewoods.    The word in Romans 12:10 is a form of this lastword,  storge . To  be specific, it is  philostorgos  -- tender affection,especially toward precious  family members. But the key new element here for us is thisaffectionateness. This is what  I want to focus on today.     The command for believers to love each other inthe New Testament --  the command for how we are to relate to each other in the body ofChrist -- is not merely  that we bless those who curse or that we return good for evil, orthat we pray for those  who treat us badly or that we  do  unto others as we wantthem to  do  to us.  There is more to this command. We are to   feel   anaffection, a tender  affection for each other.    Before we think about the implications of this,lets look at several  other texts which point in the same direction. For example 1 Peter1:22,           Since you have in obedience to the truthpurified your souls for a    sincere love of the brethren,  fervently love one another fromthe heart.          Here again is something much more than treatingeach other well. Here  is something from the heart. Something earnest, something withfervor. Something of family  affection.     In Philippians 1:8 Paul says to the church,           For God is my witness, how I longfor you all with the  affection     of Christ Jesus.         The word for affection isintestines or  inner organs. The idea is: I long for you and love younot just with an act of  will power but with deep and tender affections. I miss you. I amhomesick for you. I feel.  In 2 Corinthians 6:11-13 he calls for the church to share thiskind of love:           Our mouth has spoken freely to you, OCorinthians,  our heart is    opened wide . 12 You are not restrained by us, but you arerestrained in your own  affections .    13 Now in a like exchange-- I speak as to children--  openwide to us also .        This is the command of love among believers:wide hearts open to each  other, not cramped, narrow affections.    Another pointer to this kind of love amongChristians is the fact that  five times in the New Testament Christians are told to Greetone another with a  (holy)   kiss of love   (1 Pet. 5:14; 1 Thess.5:26; 2 Cor. 13:12; 1 Cor.  16:20; Rom. 16:16). This raises the question whether our culturalhandshake really carries  what Christ means for us to feel for each other.    So I conclude that it is the will of God forhis children not just to  do good things for each other, and not just to pray for each otheror speak decently of  each other -- those are crucial and demand the power of the HolySpirit to accomplish. But  God&#146;s will is for more: Love each other with brotherlyaffection.  Open your hearts wide to each other. Feel foreach other a kind of  tender affection and longing that would naturally be expressed ina holy kiss of  love.     Beware!     Now beware of being controlled by a populartheology at this point.  There is a popular way of looking at God and our own wills andemotions that says: God  will not command of us what we don&#146;t have immediate moralpower to perform. And since  we cannot by an act of will start feeling affection for someone,God would not require  this of us. It is amazing how many people are consciously andunconsciously controlled by  that view of things. We read a command like, Love oneanother with tender  affection, and, without even thinking, we excuse ourselveson the basis of the fact  that we cannot at this moment produce by an act of will suchtender affection. Therefore  we conclude it cannot be a real command, and we are not guilty ifwe don&#146;t have the  affection because we are not really responsible for thespontaneous affections and  emotions of our hearts.    This way of thinking happens so fast, that itis scarcely noticed. We  just keep on reading. I urge you to stop right now and reconsider.Very seriously. This is  a deeply defective way of seeing God and of understanding your ownemotions. The truth is  that God does have a right to command that we feel anything weought to feel. If we ought  to feel joy in the Lord, he commands, Rejoice in theLord (Phil. 4:4) If we  ought to feel the sorrow of sympathy, he commands, Weep withthose who weep  (Rom. 12:15). If we ought to feel gratitude for a great gift, hecommands, Be  thankful (Col. 3:15). If we should feel remorse for our sin,he commands, Be  miserable and mourn and weep (Jam. 4:9). If we should feelfear of sin, he commands,  Fear the one who after he has killed has the power to castinto hell (Luke  12:5). And so on.    The fact that our hearts are so distorted bysin that we don&#146;t  feel what we ought to feel does not mean that God cannot commandwhat is right and good  and fitting for us to feel. We are responsible to feel what Godcommands us to feel. So I  plead with you be more serious when you read these commands thanyou might be if you  thought God has no right to tell you what you should feel towardothers, and that you have  no accountability for your emotions.     Now why is this so important? It&#146;simportant because tender family  affection among believers witnesses to the truth that God is ourFather. The church is not  primarily a human organization. It is primarily the family of God.To be a Christian means  that you were born a second time into the family of God. You wereborn the first time into  a human family. You were born the second time into God&#146;sfamily.     These are not mere words. They are spectacularrealities. God takes  very seriously the truth that all his children are brothers andsisters. They all have one  Father, one homeland. And God says, there is a way that mychildren should feel about each  other. Not just act toward each other, but feel about each other.They are to be tenderly  affectionate toward each other. Why? Because this testifies to thereality of the family  of God. To feel hard toward each other. To feel indifferent ornarrow, not to mention  bitter and resentful, toward each other, contradicts who God isand who we are. God is our  father and we are his children and we are brothers and sisters inone family with the  deepest common values in the universe.    So this issue of how we feel toward each otheris very important. The  issue is whether we will live the truth of God&#146;s Fatherhoodor not. Will our  affections tell the truth about God and what he has done for us toatone for our sins in  Jesus and give us new birth and faith and adopt us into hiseternal family as brothers and  sisters of Christ? This is not a small issue. It&#146;s an issueabout the truth of  Christianity. Will we tell the truth the way God calls us to:Love one another with  tender family affection?     What If I Don&#146;t Feel This TenderAffection?     But if it is so important and yet so hard,how shall we respond?  Suppose you hear the command of Jesus this morning: love thebrothers and sisters at  Bethlehem with tender affection. Open your heart wide to them.Feel a longing for them and  joy in them. And suppose you can think of several people that youdo not feel that way  about. They have gossiped about you or snubbed you or let youdown. And you say, I  hear you Lord. And I submit to the rightness of your command. Butyou see me through and  through. I do not feel affection for him. My battle is just tryingnot to hate. But I  yield. You have right to call me to this. I embrace the goodnessand the authority of your  call. I want to obey. Now what do you do?    First, pray earnestly that God, the Holy Spiritwould move in power on  your heart and work the miracle that neither you nor I can work onour own. We are talking  about supernatural living here. Pray that God would change yourheart toward his other  children -- that he would create new affections, or awaken oldones.    Second, keep your eyes focused on the heavenlyreality not the earthly  frustration. We tend to focus almost exclusively on the ways wehave be hurt or  disappointed. That will defeat us every time. There is a greaterreality to think about  and focus on, but you must make an effort. Focus on the reality ofGod&#146;s Fatherhood.  When you think about a Christian that is hard to feel affectionfor, say, God is her  Father. God is his Father. When you see her, think,God is her father.  Then say, And God is my Father. We have the same Father.Jesus is her Savior and my  Savior. The same blood bought her as bought me. The same HolySpirit indwells her as  indwells me. The same love flows from God toward her that flowstoward me. She is my  sister. He is my brother. We will live forever in the same family.We will live for ever  together in joy and ecstasy in the presence of our Father on thenew earth.     Preach to yourself these things. You willknow the truth and the  TRUTH will set you free from many defective emotions.Don&#146;t keep feeding those  defective emotions with mere earthly thoughts about how you werewronged and how you were  let down. God knows that. God will take care of that. He&#146;llsettle that account. Set  your minds on the great realities that make you a Christian.    At the beginning of this chapter (Romans 12:1-2) Paul gave the key to  how all these impossible commands are to be fulfilled.           I urge you therefore, brethren,  by themercies of God , to    present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable toGod, which is your    spiritual service of worship. 2 And do not be conformed to thisworld, but be transformed    by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the willof God is, that which is    good and acceptable and perfect.        We must be transformed by the renewal of ourminds. You can&#146;t love  Christians with tender affections in your old way of thinking andfeeling. There must be a  transformation. How? I beseech you, by the mercies ofGod. Focus on the  mercies of God. Focus on realities of heaven and eternity. Stopbeing conformed to this  age and thinking only the way the world thinks when they are hurtand disappointed. They  only think about their hurt and how bad the other person is forhurting them. But you are  to be transformed, not conformed to this earthly way of thinking.Set your mind on the  great realities that make you a Christian. Set your mind on God.He is my Father. He is  her father. He is our Father. And we will be with our Fatherforever. We cannot go on in  animosity. It is too big a lie about God.    Third, keep in mind that Christian love is notan all or nothing thing,  but a growing thing. In 2 Thessalonians 1:3 Paul commends theChristians like this;           Your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you    toward one another grows ever greater.         Love is a growing thing. So you may havesome of it and be a real  Christian and not have enough of it. You may feel some affectiontoward a fellow believer,  but also wrestle with other negative emotions. That does not meanyou are not a Christian,  or that God is not pleased with you. It means that you have beentouched by the Spirit of  your Father and he is touching you again now and saying,There is another step to  take. There is another level of love to move on to. Move now. Letthe word of my imperfect  servant, Pastor John, move you, as I am moving him, to go on tomore affection for more of  your brothers and sisters. Don&#146;t give up because of a falseall-or-nothing mentality  that does not recognize the new things God has really begun towork in you.    Fourth, do not be a relational fatalist. What Imean by that is the  feeling that its hopeless, and you could never change. You maysay, I don&#146;t  feel affection for anybody. Our family did not feel or showaffection. Well God did  not say, Do this, if your family did it. Or:Feel, if your family  felt. He knows your weakness and your woundedness. The angelGabriel came to Mary  and told here that as a virgin she would get pregnant with the Sonof God. She balked,  like you may be balking now -- that God might birth in youaffection for God&#146;s  people. But he said, Nothing will be impossible withGod. Do not be a  fatalist. Do not deny the power of God in your life.     Conclusion: An Analogy     Consider in closing the analogy inmarriage. Do you think that  married couples always feel tender affection for each other?Always feel tender and warm?  They don&#146;t. But such affection is the ideal. That is what Godcalls us to. And one of  the reasons he makes marriage unbreakable and seals it with anoath, For better of  for worse, till death do us part is because he knows that weneed to live our lives  in the circle of rugged commitment where feelings of absolutehopelessness that affection  could ever be awakened again can indeed be overcome and true newtender affections  revived. I know that it can happen. It has happened.    That is not only true in marriage. It is truein the church. I call you  to it. Let&#146;s pursue it together. Let&#146;s pray this summerand set our minds on the  great reality of God&#146;s Fatherhood over us all and grow into afamily of believers  that loves each other with tender affection.
