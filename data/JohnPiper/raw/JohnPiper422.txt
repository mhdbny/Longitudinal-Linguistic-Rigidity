  November 13, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       HOW ELDER-SHEPHERDS PREPARE    TO MEET THE CHIEF SHEPHERD    (1 Peter 5:1-4)        Therefore, I exhort the elders among you,as your      fellow alder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a      partaker of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the      flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under      compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and      not for sordid gain, but wit eagerness; nor yet as lording it      over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples      to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will      receive the unfading crown of glory.         This is a text about how to shepherd a suffering church. Recall   what the previous paragraph was about. It started in 4:12,        Beloved, do not be surprised at the fieryordeal among      you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some      strange thing were happening to you. But to the degree that you      share the sufferings of Christ keep onrejoicing.         Then in verse 17 this suffering is explained as the beginning   of the judgment of God which starts with the church and then moves   out to the unbelieving world:        For it is time for judgment to begin withthe      household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be      the outcome of those who do not obey the gospel ofGod?         Then Peter begins today's text in 1 Peter 5:1 with "Therefore I   exhort the elders among you." "Therefore" -- in the light of this   suffering in the church and in the light of the judgment of God   that is purifying the church before it punishes the world -- in   the light of that, here's how to shepherd the suffering flock.       Keeping this in mind -- that this is a short course in   elder-shepherding for a suffering church -- will help us get the   gist of what follows.       Three Observations       Let's begin with some simple but important observations. First,   the churches had elders. This letter you remember (1:1) is written   to churches in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bythinia.   This is a huge and diverse area, and probably included dozens or   hundreds of churches. And Peter, without hesitation or   qualification, addresses the elders in these churches. We learn   from this that elders were the normal way churches were led in the   New Testament time.       Second, the elders were shepherds, that is, they were pastors.   The noun "pastor" or "shepherd" only occurs once in the New   Testament in reference to the leaders of the church (Eph. 4:11).   But the verb "to shepherd" occurs several times. It occurs here in   verse 2, "Shepherd the flock of God." Jesus uses it when he says   to Peter, "Shepherd by sheep" (John 21:16). And Paul uses it when   he says to the Ephesian elders, "Shepherd the church of God which   he purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28). So elders were the   shepherds of the flock, the pastors (just another word for   shepherd).       Third, the elder-shepherds are charged with oversight. Verse 2:   Peter says to the elders, "Shepherd the flock of God among you,   exercising oversight." Oversight is not the only duty of   shepherding, but it is the one Peter mentions here in the   situation of suffering. It's made up of two words in Greek just   like it is in English: "over" and "sight". Elder-shepherds   exercise oversight. They are "overseers" (as Paul says in 1   Timothy 3:1-2). They lookout over the flock. God holds them   accountable for seeing the big picture and acting for the good of   the whole flock.       In one sense the elder-shepherds are just sheep like every   other Christian, with Christ as the Chief Shepherd (v. 4). But by   virtue of their calling and their gifts and their affirmation by   the church, they have a responsibility that is different than the   rest of the sheep. Responsibility is the key word, or   accountability. The Chief Shepherd will hold them responsible --   he will call them to give an account someday for exercising   oversight. The rest of the sheep will not be called to give an   account for oversight. Only the elders, the shepherds. Did they   see the big picture? Did they act accordingly? Did they "exercise   oversight"?       Those are three simple, but very important observations: 1) the   churches had elders; 2) the elders were shepherds; and 3) the   elder-shepherds were charged with the oversight of the flock.       Now as far as I can tell, all of that was universal in the   early church. It didn't vary from church to church. It is not   unique to a suffering congregation. But what follows has a special   slant to it that I think comes from the situation of suffering   these churches were in.       Three Ways Elders are to Shepherd       As he addresses this situation of suffering, Peter tells us   three things about the kind of oversight elder-shepherds should   exercise: each of the three things has a negative and positive.       Verses 2b: exercise your oversight . . .       - not under compulsion,    + but voluntarily, according to the will of God;       - and not for sordid gain,    + but with eagerness;       Verse 3: exercise your oversight . . .       - nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge,    + but proving to be examples to the flock.       Not Under Compulsion, but Voluntarily       Why does Peter begin by telling the elders to exercise their   oversight "not under compulsion, but voluntarily"? What kind of   situation might result in having elders who don't want to be   elders? That seems to be the situation, doesn't it? There is a   threat that elders in these churches are feeling like the work is   not really something they want to do. They are feeling forced to   do it, when they would really rather be doing something else.       My suggestion is that it's the suffering of the church that   accounts for Peter's emphasis here. It's really very simple.   Elder-shepherds have less desire to be elders and shepherds if its   dangerous and difficult. There are at least two reasons to think   that it was dangerous to be the shepherds of suffering flocks.       One is that when persecution comes the leaders of the flock are   the most visible and sometimes the most vulnerable. If you are the   shepherd of a suffering flock, you will be among the first to   fall. That's the way it was with Richard Wurmbrand and his wife   and Joseph Tson in Romania. That's the way it was with Stephen and   the Peter and James in the early church. Stephen was probably the   most eloquent spokesman of the Hellenistic wing. And James and   Peter were the leaders of the whole church. Stephen was killed in   Acts 7; and James was killed in Acts 12; and Peter barely escaped   the sword of Herod by a miracle.       So it's dangerous to be a leader when the church is under   persecution. These churches were about to go through a fiery   ordeal (4:12) and it is understandable that the elder-shepherds   might look for another job.       A second reason the elder-shepherds might shrink back from   their duty is that not only are they vulnerable to man's normal   antagonisms, but they are also vulnerable to God's judgment in a   peculiar way. You recall that 1 Peter 4:17 says God's judgment had   begun with the house of God. There is a scary reference here to   Ezekiel 9 for the elders. Ezekiel 9 is a description of the way   God brought judgment on his people once before. He he not only   began at the house of God; he began with the elders.        4 And the Lord said to him &#91;anangel&#93;, "Go      through the midst of the city, even through the midst of      Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh      and groan over all the abominations which are being committed      in its midst." 5 But to the others He said in my hearing, "Go      through the city after him and strike; do not let your eye have      pity, and do not spare. 6 Utterly slay old men, young men,      maidens, little children, and women, but do not touch any man      on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My sanctuary." So      they started with the elders who were before thetemple.         In other words, it has been God's way bring judgment on his own   people beginning with the house of God (as 4:17 says) and in the   house of God beginning with the elder-shepherds.       So it's not surprising that the elders in the churches of   Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bythinia might have been   reluctant to exercise oversight. So Peter says exercise your   oversight "not under compulsion, but voluntarily."       What this means is that danger and difficulty is one test of   the true elder-shepherd. Just this week we have been reading in   John 10 and I saw this with tremendous personal forcefulness and   relevance. Jesus said in John 10: "He who is a hireling, and not a   shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, beholds the wolf   coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees, and the wolf snatches   them, and scatters them. He flees because he is a hireling and is   not concerned about the sheep." In other words the presence of   danger and difficulty tend to separate the hirelings from the   shepherds.       They tend to. But Peter warns that there are a couple strong   worldly motives for being and elder-shepherd even when your heart   is not in it. The two motives are money and power. A man might   even risk danger for a while if it meant a comfort boost of   financial gain, or an ego boost of power.       Not For Sordid Gain, but with Eagerness       Verse 2 at the end: exercise your oversight "not for sordid   gain, but with eagerness." "Sordid gain" means making the ministry   a means to get rich. It means being motivated by money in the   ministry. It means thinking constantly about vacations and days   off and retirement benefits instead of thinking about the value of   the human soul and the preciousness of truth and the power of the   Holy Spirit and the coming glory of the Chief Shepherd. A man   might even hang on for a while in the face of great difficulty if   he could make godliness a means of gain, as Paul said in 1 Timothy   6:5.       Not Lording It Over, but Proving to Be Examples       Then in verse 3 Peter warns against the other worldly motive   that might keep an elder-shepherd in office when his heart for it   is gone. He says that we should not exercise our oversight as   "lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be   examples to the flock."       "Lording it over" implies that the elder-shepherd is driven by   the love of power. He gets an ego high from flaunting his   authority and prestige and dominance. He needs to be up front. He   likes the best seats in the synagogue, as Jesus said. He likes to   be addressed with titles. He craves the praise and the dependence   of men. He may be a boisterous domineering sort. Or he may   manipulate with the feigned pain of a wounded hero. Or he may be a   consummate politician who measures his words so as to curry the   favor of the powerful and enhance his security in office.       Peter says: the test of such elder-shepherds is in their life   -- their whole life. Are they examples for the flock. Verse 3: Do   not lord it over the flock, "but prove to be examples to the   flock." Is their public oversight a show, or does their whole life   prove their authenticity? Is there a public shepherd and a   different private shepherd? What about his family and his finances   and his hospitality and his discernment and reputation among   spiritual people and those outside?       Motivation for Elder-Shepherds       Sometimes we think that seasons of suffering are automatically   purifying for the church and its leaders; and in general they are.   But Peter makes it plain here that it is not so simple. He was   writing into a season of suffering. And instead of assuming that   danger and difficulty would automatically cleanse the eldership,   he warns that even when men have lost the heartfelt desire for the   great work of shepherding the flock of God, and even when they may   face danger difficulty in it, some might hang on because of money   and power.       O how discerning the church needs to be. O how we   elder-shepherds need to "take heed to ourselves" as well as to all   the flock (Acts 2:28)! And search ourselves and test ourselves and   see if there be any wicked way in us. If we don't, God will.       What then can sustain the love expressed in the words: Exercise   oversight "with eagerness." Do you see that phrase at the end of   verse 2? Shepherd the flock "with eagerness". That is, want to!   Love to! Delight to! Here is real love for the flock -- eagerness   to shepherd, not motivated by money or power.       What can sustain that kind of love? Peter tells us in verse 4:   "And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the   unfading crown of glory."       I am in touch with a good number pastors around the country and   a good number of elders. I don't know any today who would say that   their job is easy. But the ones I know best (in this church and   beyond) are good men. What keeps them going is not the love of   money or the love of power. What keeps them going is that when the   Chief Shepherd comes he is going to call us to account and say,   "Did you feed my sheep? Were you vigilant over the souls of my   sheep? Did you seek my lost sheep? Did you guard the deposit of my   truth? Did you stand watch against the wolves? Did you love my   flock?"       And when the Chief Shepherd comes, with him will come his   everlasting reward: the unfading crown of glory. And that will be   enough for the elder-shepherd. God is building something wonderful   at Bethlehem: elder-shepherds, deacons, ministers of mercy of all   kinds. You are a part of it. Pray. Dream. Be ready. God is   building and calling. Listen for him.       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
