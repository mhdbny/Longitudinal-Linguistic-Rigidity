 February 9, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       The Full Assurance of Hope    (Hebrews 6:9-11)         Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved,      we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation. For God      is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which      you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.      And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in      realizing the full assurance of hope until the end.             Last week we focussed on verse 10 and noticed four things:        1. We saw that serving the saints (loving each other, caring   for each other, encouraging each other, supporting each other,   being there for each other) is a way of expressing love toward the   name of God (". . . love which you showed toward his name in   serving the saints. . .").        2. We saw that God will never forget love shown to his name in   the service of his people. He will remember it and reward it. "God   . . . &#91;will not&#93; overlook (or forget) the love you showed   toward his name in serving the saints." The smallest things done   for the sake of his name and for the good of others will be   remembered by God even when no one else does.        3. We saw that God's commitment to remember your love for his   name and your service to his people is based on his unimpeachable   justice. "God is not unjust so as to forget the love you showed to   his name."        4. We saw that the reason his justice is the foundation of this   commitment to remember your love for his name is that God's   justice is his unswerving allegiance to uphold the worth and honor   of his name. So when you love his name, and when you serve the   saints out of love for God's name, you show the worth and honor of   his name. And God would therefore be unjust, unrighteous, to   forget your work.        The upshot is this: if we want to serve people in the most   helpful way, and if we want God to remember us with the greatest   possible blessing, then we should devote ourselves above all   things to loving his name. Because verse 10 teaches us that love   toward the name of God is the source of genuine service and love   toward his name is the means of being remembered by God with   blessing.        The inter-relationships of these three things (being   remembered, loving God, serving people) are very important. It   would be wrong to go away from verse 10, or from last Sunday's   message, and say, "Well I better work harder on serving the saints   so that I can get God to remember me with blessing." The reason   that is wrong is not that the desire for blessing is wrong. The   reason it's wrong is that the first step is left out, namely,   falling in love with the name of God.        Trying to serve the saints without being satisfied first with   the beauty of God--his grace and power and wisdom and truth and   goodness and justice--is like setting out to cross the desert in   search of paradise without any water bottles and with no guide and   with no assurance that there are oases to replenish you.        The right response to verse 10, or to last Sunday's message, is   to put first things first--to devote yourself first to knowing and   loving the name of God. Without that, service becomes servility,   and the quest for reward becomes mercenary. Service stops being   the fruit of the Spirit and becomes the works of the flesh. And   the quest for reward stops being a spiritual hunger for more of   God, and becomes a merely carnal desire to escape the pain and get   pleasure--God or no God. That's the great danger if you don't keep   first things first, namely love for God's name.        Another way to put it would be to say: the right response to   verse 10 and to last Sunday's message is verses 11 and 12.         And we desire each one of you to show the same      earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the      end, so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those      who through faith and patience inherit the promises.         There are several goals here:                  the goal of inheriting the promises,              the goal of imitating the lives of those who have lived in      faith and patience, and              the goal of not to get sluggish or dull or weary in all      this.            But now notice carefully that the effort to attain these goals   (which are mentioned in verse 12) is not an effort focussed   directly on not becoming sluggish, or directly on imitation, or   directly on inheriting the promises. Where is the effort focussed   directly? The effort, the earnest pursuit, is focussed directly on   realizing the full assurance of hope (v. 11).        Now notice: just as in verse 10 it is all important to see the   inter-relationships of these things. Look how the writer connects   verse 11 and verse 12. Most of the versions (not the NIV!) bring   out the crucial relationship between verses 11 and 12. Verse 11 is   the means to the end of verse 12. And that is brought out by the   word "that" or "so that" or "in order that."        And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in   realizing the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you   may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and   patience inherit the promises.        Not being sluggish, is a goal but you aim at it by realizing   the full assurance of hope. Imitating the faithful is a goal but   you aim at it by realizing the full assurance of hope. Inheriting   the promises is a goal but you aim at it by realizing the full   assurance of faith.        This is the same approach to the Christian life that we saw in   verse 10 last week. One goal was to serve the saints, but the way   to aim at the goal is to aim at loving the name of God. Another   goal was that the Lord would remember our work and love, but the   way to aim at the goal was to aim at loving the name of the   Lord.        This is the main thing I want to get across in these two weeks.   There is a fight to be fought in the Christian life. There is a   kind of effort and earnestness. Laziness and sluggishness are not   the way to live. But the direct focus of the fight is not first on   serving or first working or first on patient endurance. The direct   focus of the fight is to maintain the full assurance of hope and   to love the name of the Lord. And the rest results from that.        Verse 11: "We desire you to show the same earnestness in   realizing the full assurance of hope to the end SO THAT . . ." the   other aims will come. If you want not to be sluggish--if you want   to imitate the patient and faithful saints, if you want to inherit   the promises--then earnestly fight to maintain the assurance of   hope. Don't get the focus wrong.        The clearest link between verses 10 and 11 is the word "same."   "We desire you to show the same earnestness . . ." The same as   what? The key is noticing the word "show" in both verses. "Show"   the same earnestness (in verse 11) as what you "showed" (in verse   10). And what you showed in verse 10 was love to the name of God:   "God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which   you showed toward his name . . ." Now "show" the same earnestness   in verse 11.        So the thought goes like this: You showed love toward the name   of God and it came out in serving the saints. Now show the same   earnestness toward the full assurance of hope, and it will come   out in the imitation of the faithful and persevering saints.        These are not really two separate focuses: loving God and   hoping in God. Loving the name of God means being satisfied more   and more with who God is now. Having the full assurance of hope   means being satisfied with what God will be for us and do for us   in the future. They are not really separate things. What they are   saying together is this: the first business of the Christian life   is to find God satisfying--because of who he is now (that's called   loving him), and because of what he will be for you in the future   (that's called hoping in him).        So here in these verses we have one of the most basic things to   learn about living the Christian life: the way to be a servant of   others, the way to be patient, the way not to be sluggish, the way   to inherit the promises, the way to be remembered by God, is to   show great earnestness--zeal, diligence--in being satisfied with   God, loving who he is and hoping fully in what he will be for you   in the future.        The most fundamental fight of the Christian life is to keep on   being satisfied with God. When you look up, to keep on feeling   love for the glory of his name. When you look forward, to keep on   feeling hope in the greatness of his promises.        Is there a diligence in the Christian life? Is there an   earnestness? Is there a fight and a struggle and a zeal and a   passion? Yes. But the direct focus of that earnestness is not   first on certain behaviors but on God--maintaining the assurance   of hope in God and the sweetness of love for his name. All other   obedience is a second commandment. And if second things become   first things, we may have a rigorous religion, but we will not   have evangelical, God-centered, biblical Christianity.        Pause for a minute here with me and dwell on this. I don't have   time to say much more. I want this to grip you the way it has   gripped me more deeply these past two days than in a long time. It   is possible for Christians--even those who have drunk for decades   at the spring of God's grace--to slowly wander away from the   fountain of life. It is possible even in the ministry--the   water-carrying business--to stop going back to the spring and   settle for pools and puddles down the hill.        This morning I think there are many of us who need to hear the   simple, loving exhortation: let us go back up the stream and get   down and drink until you are satisfied with God.        How many of us are trying to serve the saints? How many of us   are trying to be remembered for our work? How many of us are   trying to imitate some great saint? How many of us are trying to   be longsuffering in some hard situation? And it isn't flowing from   a heart satisfied with God.        We need to go back up to the spring that overflows with God and   there simply come to love him again for who he is, and find the   assurance of hope again for what he promises to be for us in the   future.        And I don't mean go to him to get healthy or to get a job or to   get a spouse or to get your marriage fixed or to get your bills   paid. I mean go to him and dwell with him. Look upon him (Heb.   3:1) until he becomes your heart's satisfaction. Until you love   him for what he is for you now, and until you have a full   assurance of hope in what he will be for you in the future.        That is what many of us need above all things this morning. I   invite you to be earnest and to go back up to God and be with him   until you love him and hope fully in him.
