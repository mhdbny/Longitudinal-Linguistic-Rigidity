      October 15, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     The Mission and Vision of    Bethlehem Baptist Church   Volume 4    By treasuring all that God is,Loving allwhom he loves . . .   Unpacking the Master Planning Team Document   The Spiritual Dynamic (Part 2)       Introduction and Review     We are in a season of life at Bethlehemthat for many of us,  contrary to the weather outside, feels like spring. We believethat God has graciously led  the elders and the Master Planning Team for the last 12 months indiscovering and  expressing the Mission of our church. We believe this missionstatement is faithful to who  God is and what he values most. And we believe it&#146;sauthentic. It gets at the special  calling of our church with our strengths and our weaknesses. Wedon&#146;t think every  church should say it the same way we do. But here at the center ofthe city, at this time  in history, surrounded by this decaying, God-neglecting culture,with this staff and these  elders and these people and this building and with these hundred-twenty-five years behind  us -- with all their glory and all their pain -- we believe thisis what God is calling us  to be and to do.    Let&#146;s read together Our Mission on thefront cover of the Mission  booklet. Our mission is:                 To spread a passion        for the supremacy of God        in all things |       for the joy        of all peoples.                   Two weeks ago I unpacked the meaning of thoseeighteen words with their  biblical foundations. Then last week we turned to page two andbegan to unpack our  Spiritual Dynamic. The Spiritual Dynamicis the way God&#146;s  power is released among us so that we can do the Mission.It&#146;s the spiritual HOW. How  do you magnify the supremacy of God&#146;s glory. If our wholepurpose is to spread a  passion for the supremacy of God, what does that passion looklike? And how do you become  that kind of person? What has to happen for sinful people like usto be able to do that?    That&#146;s what the Spiritual Dynamic isabout. Let&#146;s read it  together (p. 2).                 We join God the Father                 in magnifying the supremacy of His glory                through our Lord Jesus Christ,                in the power of the Holy Spirit by                 treasuring  all that God is,                 loving  all whom He loves,                 praying  for all His purposes,                 Meditating  on all His word,                sustained by all His  grace .                   The first words simply restate the Mission:We join God the  Father in magnifying the supremacy of His glory. That is, wemake it our aim to  share God&#146;s zeal for God&#146;s glory.    Then last week we took up the next two lines:we do this through  our Lord Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy Spirit. Ourmission is only possible  through our Lord Jesus Christ. Christ had to dosomething to make this mission  of magnifying God possible. And what he had to do was die for oursins. Without this great  substitutionary death on the cross we would be left alienated fromGod, under his wrath,  laden with guilt with nothing but a fearful prospect of judgmentand hell. We could not  enjoy and magnify the supremacy of God&#146;s glory if Christ hadnot died for our sins.     The Main Thing in Christianity     Now let me say something here to make moreclear what Christianity  is and what it isn&#146;t. You must get this or you won&#146;t getwhat Christianity is or  what we stand for as a church. Christianity is NOT first or mainlya system of moral  renovation. It is not mainly a way to make bad people good. Thatis the way the world  sometimes sees Christianity from the outside. And that is whatwill make the world  tolerate and sometimes praise Christianity. But this is not whatChristianity is first and  foremost.    First and foremost Christianity is a work ofGod to set man right with  God. Christianity addresses the fundamental problem in theuniverse first and foremost.  And that problem is not that human beings are mean to each otherbut that we are alienated  from God and under his wrath. The first issue for every humanbeing is, How can I  get right with God?, not How can I become a niceperson?. How can I be  reconciled to God when I am under his curse for my rebellion andsins (Gal. 3:13)? And the  message of Christianity is that there is nothing we could dobridge the chasm of guilt and  indignation between us and God. Only God could do that. And he didit by sending his only  Son into the world to die.     The gospel is not good  advice  for what Ican do to become a  better person. It is good  news  of what God has  done to remove his wrath and  to lift the curse and to forgive our sin and take away our guiltand to set us in a right  relationship with him. All the moral renovation we hope for comesafter this and is based  on it, but is not the main thing in Christianity. At the heart ofthe Christian good news  is that God acted in history to remove the wrath of God. God actedon God. God in Christ  absorbed the wrath of God. God in Christ bore the curse of God.God in Christ took the  punishment of our sins that was appointed by God. Before we wereinvolved with our  salvation at all, God accomplished it. He averted his own wrath.He lifted his own curse.  He vindicated his own righteousness. All of that in the death ofhis Son before we had any  part in it.    Do you see why the centrality and supremacy ofGod is so crucial in our  mission statement? The Christian gospel is unintelligible apartfrom the centrality of  God. The main problem for humanity is not racial hostility orviolence or greed or the  breakdown of the family, or war, or famine, or AIDS. The mainproblem for humanity is the  wrath of God. How can we be put right with God so that omnipotentpower is not against us  but for us.    And the answer is: through our Lord JesusChrist. Because  the Son of God died to demonstrate the righteousness of God inshowing mercy to sinners,  God is now free to save sinners without compromising hisrighteousness (Rom. 3:25-26).  Because Christ died for our sins, God can now justify the ungodlywithout being unjust  (Rom. 3:26; 4:5). He can acquit us and forgive us and put us in aright relationship, in  spite of our sins, because Christ has endured the punishment thatour sins deserved.     And in this new right relationship God is freeto pour out the Holy  Spirit into our lives so that we can fulfill our mission ofmagnifying his glory.    But now today the question is: HOW do you cometo benefit from this  work of God through our Lord Jesus Christ on thecross? Not everyone is  justified by the death of Jesus. Some people keep their sins andtake them to the judgment  and bear the whole load themselves for ever in hell. It is a greatsorrow. But there is  another way to go. The Bible makes clear how we can be justifiedby God -- how we can be  forgiven and acquitted and accepted and reckoned righteous in hispresence. Namely by  faith.    Romans 3:28 says,           We maintain that a man is  justified byfaith  apart from    works of the Law.         Romans 5:1 says,           Having been  justified by faith , wehave peace with God    through our Lord Jesus Christ.        Galatians 2:16 says,            [We know]  that a man isnot justified by the works    of the Law but  through faith in ChristJesus.         So before there is any moral renovation thereis free justification.  Christianity is not first our becoming good people. It is firstGod remaining a just and  holy God in the justification of ungodly people. And he did thatthrough the death of our  Lord Jesus Christ. Then the key that opens all that for any of usis faith. We share in  all this great finished wrath-removing, curse-lifting, sin-forgiving work NOT by becoming  good people, but by faith. By faith we are united to Christ andall that God accomplished  through him becomes ours.    So the question you should be asking now is:Why in the Spiritual  Dynamic did you use the words, by treasuring all that Godis, instead of  saying, by faith? Do you see where we are? Our aim isto magnify the supremacy  of God&#146;s glory through our Lord Jesus Christ, whose workreleases the power and the  blessing of God&#146;s Spirit on those who are justified   bytreasuring all that God  is.   Why do we use this language of treasuring and not thelanguage of faith?    Here are the reasons:      1. Misunderstanding ofBelieving     Because justifying faith ismisunderstood by many  people as simply a decision of the mind to agree with some factsrather than a change of  the heart to embrace a treasure. Over the years as I have tried todo evangelism on the  streets and in my office I have found that almost everybody saysthey believe in Jesus --  drunk people, liars, thieves, adulterers -- it&#146;s amazing howmany people say they  believe in Jesus who are living lives totally contrary to thewords of Jesus. Jesus warns  that these people are going to be shocked at the judgment (Matthew7:21).     Even in the church there are people who equatejustifying faith with  simply believing that Jesus died for them. But they don&#146;tbelieve other crucial  things about Jesus -- namely, that he is a wise marriagecounselor; that he is the best  investment advisor; that he is the best personal friend to spendtime with; that he is  infallibly wise in his instructions about sexual conduct, and soon. In other words a lot  of people treat faith in Jesus as something far less than what itreally is, and so  deceive themselves that they are Christians when they are not.There has been no heart  change and Jesus is not really received and embraced and trustedfor what he is.     We are looking for words that help protectpeople from that terrible  mistake. That is the first reason for using the language oftreasuring.     2. Trusting is Treasuring     The second reason is that treasuringall that God is  draws attention to the future orientation of justifying faith.Here&#146;s what I mean.  Hebrews 11:1 defines faith like this:      Faith is the assurance of things hopedfor the conviction of  things not seen.      Justifying faith is not mainly a backward-looking belief in what Jesus  did for us; but a forward-looking assurance of what that past workpromises. What we do  when we put our faith in Jesus is embrace all that God is for usin Jesus. And that means  all that he WILL BE for us for ever and ever. He will work allthings together for our  good; he will keep us in faith to the end; he will rescue us fromdeath and raise us up  with Christ to enjoy his fellowship for ever and ever in the newheavens and the new  earth. Justifying faith is faith in Future Grace, not just pastgrace. And that future  grace is our all-satisfying treasure. So trusting is treasuring.     3. Faith Quenches Spiritual Thirst     The third reason for saying that we magnifyGod&#146;s glory  by treasuring all that God is is that Jesus describesfaith as a  thirst-quenching act of drinking from God. In John 6:35 Jesussays,           I am the bread of life; he who comes toMe shall not hunger, and he    who believes in Me shall never thirst.         Jesus is the bread of life and the water oflife (John 4:14). Believing  in him means turning from the fleeting pleasures of the world tothe soul-satisfying joy  of who Jesus is. Therefore faith -- justifying, saving faith -- istreasuring all that God  is for us in Jesus, like a man dying of thirst treasures water.    That&#146;s how we connect with the wrath-absorbing, curse-lifting,  sin-forgiving, guilt-removing, reconciling work of Jesus on thecross so that it applies  to us. We believe Jesus for all that he is. We treasure all thatGod is for us in him.    This is the channel of the Holy Spirit. This ishow he comes with power  into our lives so that we can fulfill our mission. Galatians 3:5makes this plain:           Does He then  (= God) , whoprovides you with the Spirit and    works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or byhearing with faith?         Answer: by hearing with faith. Faith is the waywe connect with the  inexhaustible supply of the Holy Spirit. Not by works, but byfaith -- by trusting the  promises of God (what we hear), or treasuring all thatGod is for us in Jesus.     Love is the Visible Form of Faith     That leaves one last question for thismorning. What does  treasuring all that God is have to do with the nextline, loving all  whom He loves? In our Spiritual Dynamic we magnify thesupremacy of God&#146;s glory  through our Lord Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy Spirit, bytreasuring all that he  is, and loving all whom He loves. What&#146;s the connectionbetween loving other  people and treasuring all that God is, and magnifying God&#146;sglory?    God&#146;s goal is that our lives reveal hisglory. But faith is  invisible. It&#146;s something that happens in the heart. God cansee it, and perhaps the  angels in heaven can see it, and maybe the devil can see it. Andso it does honor God;  because, when you trust and treasure someone, you say that theyare trustworthy and  valuable. So if someone can see your faith, they see a pointer tothe value of God. But  people can&#146;t see your faith, if it stays inside of you. YetGod intends for the  supremacy of his glory to be magnified openly, visibly. He wantshis glory on display. He  wants it to fill the earth the way the waters cover the sea (Hab.2:14).    So he said to his disciples -- to us --Let your light shine  before men in such a way that they may   see   your goodworks, and glorify your  Father who is in heaven. How does the treasure of God becomevisible to the world,  so that they give him glory? Answer: Jesus says, it becomesvisible when it produces good  deeds -- that is, when it produces love. Love for people is thevisible form of faith.     Here&#146;s the way Paul puts it in Galatians5:6,           In Christ Jesus neither circumcision noruncircumcision means    anything, but  faith working through love .        Faith works through love. It becomes active andvisible in the form of  love that people can see.    Why is this? It&#146;s because faith is atreasuring of all that God  is. Faith is being satisfied with all that God promises to be foryou in Christ. Faith is  the assurance that all the promises of God are yours in Christ. Itis the confidence that  everything in your life is going to work for your good. Whichmeans that faith frees you  from the fears and anxieties and covetousness and self-pity andbitterness and  discouragement that make love so hard.      Conclusion     O how I long for us as a people to catch onto how Our Mission (p.  1) and Spiritual Dynamic (p. 2) and Fresh Initiatives (p. 3) hangtogether and flow from  one great passion. Notice the first column on page 3 of the FreshInitiatives:         Our  Mission  and  SpiritualDynamic  declare that the    all-satisfying supremacy of God shines most brightly throughsacrificial deeds of joyful    love. The cry of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of our people isfor a fresh, decisive    emphasis on  Relationships of Love .      Therefore we eagerly embrace God&#146;s callfor new, visible    manifestations of love toward each other, our guests and ourneighbors. With a fresh    openness and outgoing spirit to each other and to all newpeople, we henceforth put    understanding above accusation, forbearance above faultfinding,and Biblical unity above    the demand for uniformity.       Do you see how it is all hanging together? This is a document about  visible manifestations of authentic love  -- flowing fromhearts that are           satisfied in the treasure of God;             empowered by the Holy Spirit,             rooted in wrath-removing, sin-forgivingwork of Jesus Christ on the      cross,             and driven by a passion for the supremacyof God.            Pray with me and with the staff that God willdo this among us.  Dedicate yourself afresh right now to be so satisfied with whatGod promises to be for  you, that you will love others with new warmth and earnestness.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
