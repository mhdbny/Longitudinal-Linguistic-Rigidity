  December 1, 1996 Bethlehem Baptist Church John Piper, Pastor      Jesus: From Melchizedek to EternalSavior   (Hebrews 7:1-25 )     For this Melchizedek, king ofSalem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he wasreturning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2 to whomalso Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first ofall, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and thenalso king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3 Without father, withoutmother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor endof life, but made like the Son of God, he abides a priestperpetually. 4 Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham,the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5 And thoseindeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office havecommandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is,from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6 Butthe one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenthfrom Abraham, and blessed the one who had the promises. 7 But withoutany dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8 And in this casemortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, ofwhom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9 And, so to speak, throughAbraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10 for he wasstill in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. 11 Now ifperfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis ofit the people received the Law), what further need was there foranother priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, andnot be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12 For when thepriesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of lawalso. 13 For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongsto another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribewith reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to thelikeness of Melchizedek, 16 who has become such not on the basis of alaw of physical requirement, but according to the power of anindestructible life. 17 For it is witnessed of Him, "THOU ART APRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK." 18 For, on theone hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because ofits weakness and uselessness 19 (for the Law made nothing perfect),and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope,through which we draw near to God. 20 And inasmuch as it was notwithout an oath 21 (for they indeed became priests without an oath,but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, "THE LORD HASSWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, 'THOU ART A PRIEST FOREVER'"); 22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a bettercovenant. 23 And the former priests, on the one hand, existed ingreater numbers, because they were prevented by death fromcontinuing, 24 but He, on the other hand, because He abides forever,holds His priesthood permanently. 25 Hence, also, He is able to saveforever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always livesto make intercession for them.     Christ's SuperiorPriesthood    Instead of dealing with thesetwenty-five verses in detail today, I want us to get the big pictureand the main point. The big picture is of Christ's superiorpriesthood over the Old Testament priests of the tribe of Levi. Andthe main point is in verse 25. Do you see the word "hence" or"therefore"? That means this is the great conclusion from all thepreceding truth about Christ's priesthood. Verse 25 is the mainpoint, the conclusion of it all: "Hence, also, He is able to saveforever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always livesto make intercession for them."    Verses 1-24 may be complex anddifficult to understand without earnest mental effort, but this verse25 is wonderfully plain. It has three parts.     Christ is able tosave    forever          (25a) -- a great promise.    He    always    lives to make intercession for us(25c).    This eternal intercession andeternal salvation are for those who draw near to God through Christ(25b).     Think with me about therelationship between those first two: that Christ is able to saveforever, and that Christ always lives to make intercession for us.What's the connection? It's made explicit in the verse and it isextremely important. It says that he is able to save us forever . . .   since    (or    because   ) he always lives to make intercessionfor us. In other words, our future eternal salvation hangs onChrist's future eternal intercession for us.    This implies two hugethings.     What Are We BeingSaved From?    First, it answers the questionwhat we need to be saved from. We need to be clear about this,especially when we talk to unbelievers. For them the very term"salvation" or "being saved" may not carry the same meaning the Biblegives these terms. So we need to be clear what the Bible means. Whatare we being saved from according to this verse? The connectionbetween eternal salvation and eternal intercession gives at least onesolid answer. And it is, I think, the most basic and most importantanswer. What is it?    If, to be saved forever, weneed Christ to intercede for us forever with God, then what is theimplication about what we need saving from? The implication is thatwe need to be saved from God. Specifically we need to be saved fromthe wrath of God that burns against all ungodliness andunrighteousness (Romans 1:18). Christ can save us forever from thewrath of God because he intercedes forever with God. He continuallyputs himself between the Father and us as an asbestos shield againsthis white-hot anger against sin. Hebrews 10:30-31 says, "We know Himwho said, '   Vengeance ismine, I will repay.   'And again, '   The Lordwill judge his people.   'It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the livingGod."    Until we get this firmly andclearly fixed in our minds, hardly anything in the book of Hebrewswill make sense. The major problem in the world and in our lives is   not    our troubled marriages or our waywardchildren or our financial pressures or our failing health or ourcultural degeneration. The main problem in the world -- everybody'sproblem -- is how to be reconciled to God so that we escape histerrifying wrath at the judgment. That's the main problem.    And the Biblical answer ispriesthood. And specifically the superior priesthood of Christ. Thereason there are priests in the Old Testament is that priests areneeded to intercede for us with God. They enter the holy place wherewe are not allowed to go. And they take sacrifices for us so that oursins will be forgiven. All of that Old Testament priestly system wasmeant to teach us about our sin and the holiness and wrath of God andthe inescapable judgment that is coming on us. And the point of itall was this: God has made a way to get right with God. He providedpriests in the Old Testament, and then he provided his Son, the finalHigh Priest.    So the reason for all this talkabout Christ's relation to Melchizedek in verses 1-24 is because theeternal, superior priesthood of Jesus is our only hope of eternalsalvation. God's wrath never changes. There is only one hope forsinners like us. We must have a faithful high priest, who willintercede for us forever. We need a king of righteousness (verse 2).We need a king of peace (verse 2). We need someone without beginningand ending (verse 3). Someone who has an indestructible life (verse16) and will never die and need to be replaced (verses 23-24). Weneed someone greater than Abraham and greater than Levi -- somethinglike Melchizedek, who blessed Abraham, (verses 6-7) and who receivedtithes from Abraham and, in a sense, from Levi in Abraham (verses 5,6, 8-10). We need a new and greater priest -- so much greater thatverse 11 says there was no perfection through the Leviticalpriesthood. All the Old Testament priesthood could do was pointtoward the One superior priest (after the order of Melchizedek, Psalm110:4), whose sacrifice of himself and whose eternal intercessionwould guarantee eternal salvation for all God's people.    So the first implication ofverse 25 is that all this truth about priesthood is because what weneed saving from is the wrath of God. God's way of solving thatproblem is priesthood. This is not ours to figure out or solve. Godhas to do it for us. And he has done it. He ordains a Priest, hisSon.    And don't make a mistake here.It's not as though Jesus the Priest loves us and God the Fatherdoesn't. God the Father ordains the priesthood for our salvation. Itis his idea. He sends the priest. It is his own Son whom he sends.And he loves him infinitely. All this is the    love    of God rescuing us from the   wrath    of God, in such a way that the   justice    of God is vindicated and the   glory    of God is exalted.     Our Salvation Dependson the Work of Christ Forever and Ever    Now the second greatimplication of verse 25 is that our future salvation depends on theactive work of Christ forever and ever, not just on the past work ofChrist or on our past decisions and commitments. It says that Christis able to save forever . . .    since          he always lives to make intercession forus. In other words, he would not be able to save us forever if he didnot go on interceding for us forever.    This means our salvation is assecure as Christ's priesthood is indestructible. This is why weneeded a priest so much greater than any human. Christ's deitysecures his indestructible priesthood for us.    This means we should not talkabout our salvation in static terms the way we often do -- as if Idid something once in an act of decision, and Christ did somethingonce when he died and rose again, and that's all there is to it.That's not all there is to it. This very day I am being saved by theeternal intercession of Jesus in heaven. Jesus is praying for us andthat is our salvation.    What is this intercession? JohnOwen gives a beautiful summary of it in his 350-year-old commentaryon this verse:    The safest conception . . .that we can have of the intercession of Christ . . . is his continualappearance for us in the presence of God by virtue of his office asthe "high priest over the house of God," representing the efficacy ofhis oblation [outpouring of blood], accompanied with tender care,love, and desires for the welfare, supply, deliverance and salvationof the church. Three things, therefore, [are involved]: (1) Thepresentation of his person before the throne of God on our behalf,Heb. ix. 24 . . . (2) The representation of his death, oblation, andsacrifice for us; which gives power, life, and efficacy unto hisintercession . . . Rev. v.6 . . . (3) Both these do not render itprayer or intercession; for intercession is prayer . . . Whereforethere is in it,. . . a requesting and offering unto God, of hisdesires and will for the church, attended with care, love, andcompassion. (   Epistle tothe Hebrews   , Vol. 5,Edinburgh: Banner of Truth Trust, 1991, p. 541)    We are saved eternally by theeternal prayers (Romans 8:34) and advocacy (1 John 2:1) of Jesus inheaven as our high priest. He prays for us and his prayers areanswered because he prays perfectly on the basis of his perfectsacrifice.     What Then Might He BePraying?    Well, it says that he is ableto save because he intercedes, that is, because he prays. And it saysthat he is doing this forever. What do we need forever in order to besaved? Let's just stay with this verse to answer that. We need todraw near to God through him. "He is able to save forever   those who draw near toGod through him   ." Thisverb here, "draw near to God," is in a tense that indicates presentcontinuous action, not a single action in the past. It is not saying:God is able to save those forever who once drew near to him, but whogo on drawing near to him. If we do not go on drawing near to God wehave no warrant for thinking that we are being saved by the LordJesus.    But if this is true, then isnot this drawing near one of the things that Jesus intercedes forwith the Father? If not, then his intercession leaves out the mainthing required of us for our salvation. Which leaves us veryprecarious. But there are many reasons for thinking he does not leavethis out. One is that Hebrews 13:21 says that God is "working in uswhat is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ." One of thethings pleasing in his sight is that his people keep on drawing nearto him forever and ever. And so he is working in us this verything.    And verse 21 says he is doingthis "   through JesusChrist   " which means, atleast, that Christ has purchased this grace for us by his death andthat Christ prays and asks the Father for it on the basis of thatdeath. In other words, when the writer tells us that drawing near toGod is what qualifies us for the eternal saving work of our highpriest, he doesn't mean to say that our high priest leaves us alonein our bent and sinful nature to draw near to God on our own. Ratherour High Priest intercedes for us and asks the Father to do just whatHebrews 13:21 says he will do -- "through Jesus Christ."    Let me illustrate this by theway it looked when our High Priest was on the earth. In Luke 22:31-32Jesus says to Peter: "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demandedpermission      to sift you like wheat;but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you,when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers." Soalready Jesus was interceding for his own when he was on the earth.And what he was praying was for our faith -- that our faith not fail.(See his high priestly prayer in John 17:11,15, etc.)    And he was so confident in hisprayer for Peter that he said, "When once you have turned again . .." not, "If you turn again . . ." So even though Peter stumbled indenial, his faith did not fail utterly. That is what the Lord praysfor us. This is one more piece of our great security and our hope inthis great epistle of assurance.     God Bids UsCome    Is it not a wonderful thingthis advent season to know that God bids us come? That this great,holy God of righteousness and wrath says, "Draw near to me through mySon, your High Priest. Draw near to me. Draw near to me." This is hisclosing invitation this morning: "Draw near to me through your HighPriest. Draw near to me in confession and prayer and meditation andtrust and praise. Come. I will not cast you out."    For Christ "is able to saveforever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always livesto make intercession for them."     Copyright 1997 JohnPiper
