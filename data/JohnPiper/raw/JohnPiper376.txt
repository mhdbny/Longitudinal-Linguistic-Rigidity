 March 7, 1993    Bethlehem Baptist Church    Covenant Reaffirmation Sunday    John Piper, Pastor        RENEWING THE COVENANT    FOR THE SAKE OF GOD'S NAME    (Nehemiah 9:38)       
       Nehemiah 9:38 describes very briefly a covenant reaffirmation   among the people of God in Jerusalem after decades of exile in   Babylon. Ezra comes to the end of his prayer and says,       Now because of all this, we are making an agreement (a   covenant) in writing; and on this sealed document are the names of   our leaders, our Levites and our priests.       I chose this text for our covenant reaffirmation Sunday for   several reasons.       One is that it describes a covenant reaffirmation in the   context of a great season worship. The people have been gathered   in worship for over three weeks when Ezra brings things to a   climax with this magnificent prayer and covenant reaffirmation.   That's the spirit I long for us to be in as we reaffirm our   covenant with each other and with the Lord.       The second reason for choosing this text is that the covenant   reaffirmation described here involved the signing or sealing of   the covenant. The leaders and Levites and priests set their names   to the covenant. That seemed good for us to do too--all of us,   since in the new covenant all the people are priests.       The third reason for choosing this text for today is that the   prayer leading up to this covenant reaffirmation is full of God's   free and sovereign grace and the glory of his name. And I want us   as a people to understand and to feel this morning the massive   foundation of our covenant life together. Our foundation is not in   ourselves, or in own ability to fulfil the promises we make, but   in God, and especially his inexhaustible grace.       Let me try to show you the setting that makes this covenant   reaffirmation here in verse 38 so powerful, and gives us   encouragement to follow through with our own covenant   reaffirmation.       About 445 B.C. Nehemiah had brought a group of Israelites from   captivity in Persia back to Jerusalem, and with them had rebuilt   the walls of the city in spite of tremendous opposition from   surrounding peoples. The wall is completed at the end of chapter   6. Chapter seven gives the genealogy of those who had come back to   Jerusalem in the first group with Zerubbabel.       Then in chapter 8 on the first day of the seventh month (near   the end of September) the people gather and ask Ezra the priest to   read to them the law of Moses which they had neglected for a long   time. This is the beginning of the worship that comes to a climax   24 days later in 9:38 with the renewal of the covenant.       Ezra reads the law, the people are grieved because of how much   of God's will they have failed to do. They celebrate the feast of   booths for seven days (last half of chapter 8), and then they   consecrate themselves with fasting and worship (at the beginning   of chapter 9) and Ezra begins his prayer.       His prayer is a response to verse 5 where the Levites say,   "Stand up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to   everlasting. Blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above   all blessing and praise."       And that's what Ezra's prayer does: it blesses the glorious   name of God which is so exalted that no blessing or praise can   ever be high enough. But Ezra comes as close as a human will   probably come.       He starts with creation and recounts the power and grace of God   up to his own day against the backdrop of the repeated failures of   Israel to trust and obey.       Verse 6: You made the heavens and the earth and all that is in   them.       Verses 7-8: You chose Abram from all the peoples and made a   covenant with him to give him and his descendents the promised   land.       Verses 9-10: You heard the cry of our fathers in Egypt and   delivered them with signs and wonders and made a name for yourself   that has lasted for centuries to this very day.       Verse 12: You guided them with pillars of fire and cloud.       Verse 13: You gave them good statutes and commandments.       Verse 15: You gave bread from heaven and water from the rock   and told them to take the land.       But in spite of all this, verse 16 says, the people acted   arrogantly. They became stubborn and refused to listen, and tried   to go back to Egypt.       But then comes a long list of God's added mercies in spite of   Israel's disobedience.       Verse 17: You are a God of forgiveness, gracious and   compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in loving kindness;   and you did not forsake them.       Verses 18-19: "Even when they made for themselves a calf of   molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up from   the land of Egypt,' and committed great blasphemies, you, in your   great compassion, did not forsake them in the wilderness." This is   the focus and heart of Ezra's prayer that leads up to the covenant   reaffirmation.       The point I want us to see in this prayer is that inexhaustible   grace is the basis of our covenant affirmations. We are not taking   a deep breath this morning and saying: Here goes, I'll give it my   best shot. Instead we are saying: "With such a God as this, there   is hope that I will get the help I need, and when I stumble and   repent he will forgive me and have me back. And I will press on in   the promises I have made."       Let that sink in as we move on through the prayer.       Not only did God not forsake them because of their sin, he   pursued them with goodness and mercy again and again.       Verses 20ff: You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You   gave them manna and water. For forty years their clothes did not   wear out. They overcame kingdoms. They entered and possessed the   land. They had cities, fertile land, houses, cisterns, vineyards,   olive groves, fruit trees. And the end of verse 25 sums it up:   "They reveled in your great goodness."       The response of the people in verse 26: They became disobedient   and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back and   killed the prophets and committed great blasphemies.       God's response? Verse 27: Therefore you delivered them into the   hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, but when they cried   to you in the time of their distress, you heard from heaven and   according to your great compassion, you gave them deliverers who   delivered them from the hand of their oppressors.       Again (v. 29): they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened   their neck and would not listen.       But again (in v. 30): You bore with them for many years, and   admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets.       But they would not give ear. So the Lord gives them into exile   (v. 30b).       Yet! (this is what I mean by inexhaustible grace) in verse 31   Ezra prays, "In your great compassion you did not make an end of   them of forsake them, for you are a gracious and compassionate   God."       This brings Ezra to his petition--to ask for God's help and   deliverance now in Jerusalem where they are in distress because of   the peoples around them.       Verse 32 begins with NOW--now that we have seen what kind of   God you are, help us again. What kind of God are you? "Now   therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God,   who dost keep covenant and loving-kindness--that's the kind of God   you are. GREAT, MIGHTY, AWESOME, COVENANT-KEEPING, LOVINGLY KIND.       Which brings us to the climax in verse 38: "Now because of all   this (all what?--all the centuries-long, great, mighty, awesome,   covenant-keeping, loving work of God--because of all that) we are   making an agreement--a covenant--in writing."       That is how we come to our covenant reaffirmation this morning.   We do not come in our own strength. We do not come sufficient in   ourselves. We do not come mainly because of the beauty of covenant   community. We come mainly--like Ezra--because God is a great,   mighty, awesome, covenant-keeping, loving God, who will help us,   and who will show his love for us through the covenant.       What we are doing this morning is declaring that we want to be   a church for each other, for the wider cause of Christ, for the   world and for the glory of God. We are not claiming to be the only   church, nor a perfect church, nor an unchangeable church. But a   church as best we understand church to be.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
