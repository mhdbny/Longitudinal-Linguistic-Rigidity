    October 4, 1998    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        THE FIRST DARK EXCHANGE: IDOLATRY     (Romans 1:21-23)          For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they  became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing  to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an  image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling  creatures.    Exchanging the Glory of God for Images    For three weeks now we are going to be looking at two dark exchanges that characterize  fallen sinful man, apart from grace. The first dark exchange is the exchange of the glory  of God for the glory of images of man and animals. Call it idolatry. We will talk about  that this morning. The second dark exchange is the exchange of sexual relations with the  opposite sex for sexual relations with the same sex. We call that homosexuality. That is  what we will talk about for the next two weeks, from verses 24-27. (Parents of small  children, use wisdom in deciding if you want to make this a teaching time for them about  homosexuality. The text and the issues are painful and blunt.)    Today our focus is on verses 21-23 and the first dark exchange that characterizes  fallen human culture, idolatry. Remember the context: God's wrath is being revealed  [according to verse 18] against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress  the truth in unrighteousness. The truth that they suppress is a universally revealed  truth - a truth revealed in what God has made, namely the truth of his eternal power  and divine nature (verse 20). In suppressing the truth, verse 21a says, people  do not glorify Him as God or give thanks. Therefore they are without excuse  against God's wrath. God's wrath is just because they have the knowledge and they don't  live it. They suppress it.     Or, to put it differently, based on today's text: people behold and know the glory of  God offered them for their joy and their trust, and they exchange it for images. This is  the same suppressing and the same failure to glorify and thank that we have seen in the  last two messages from this paragraph.    So what I want to do today is to focus our attention on this dark exchange to see what  Paul says about it. And I am sure that the reason he says anything about it is not to  titillate our intellectual interest, but to move us to flee from it with all our might and  do all we can to help others to escape who are caught in this dreadful darkness of  idolatry - which pervades both the primitive cultures and the most advanced technical  cultures of the modern world.    Exchanging God for Pitiful Substitutes    I have at least four observations from this text that I think we should make. But first  let me make sure you see the exchange itself in verse 23, [They] exchanged the glory  of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and  four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Note well - the exchange is of the glory  of God for a pitiful substitute.     Now this itself needs to be stressed. We talk a lot about the glory of God at  Bethlehem. This is our favorite theme. We believe this is the great unifying reality of  the Bible and the universe. All is springing from and flowing toward the glory of God. All  that is, is for the glory of God. The ultimate value in the universe is the glory of God,  not the soul of man. It is important then for a church like ours to see texts like this  very clearly so that we will realize that this theme, this emphasis, this value is not  being laid on the Bible. It is coming from the Bible.     What we see here is that two times in this passage Paul says that the fundamental,  bottom-line, root problem with the human race has to do with what we make of the glory of  God. In verse 21 Paul says, Even though they knew God, they did not honor him  [literally: glorify him] as God. That is the fundamental problem with the human  race. We do not acknowledge, value, treasure, savor, honor, or make much of the greatest  value in the universe, the glory of God. That is our wickedness and our disease and our  great mutiny against God.    And then in verse 23 Paul puts it another way: we exchange the glory of the  incorruptible God for an image. So the great problem of the universe concerns what  humans are making of the glory of God. This is the issue of your life and this culture and  this country and this century and every century, and the issue of all the nations of the  world. When Paul reaches to describe the depths of man's sinful condition under the wrath  of God, he does not first deal with the sexual sins of verse 24-27 or the list of 21 sins  in verses 29-31. He deals first with the fundamental problem: What do we make of the glory  of God? Do we magnify it by treasuring above all things? Or do we belittle it by  preferring other things and exchanging it for created things?    Observations about this Dark Exchange    So this is a huge issue and I pray that as we make these four observations about this  dark exchange, God will awaken in us a new love and a new reverence for his glory.    1.  This dark exchange of God's glory for images is accompanied by futile speculations    Verse 21: Even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give  thanks, but they became futile in their speculations [or their thoughts]. Futile,  here, means empty, vain, useless. God gave human beings minds with the capacity to reason  and imagine and speculate and think and ponder and meditate. Why? So that we might use  them to know God and to think about him and speak of him and praise him and devise things  in the world which would honor him.     We see this vividly in the story of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4. He uses his mind and  might to build Babylon, then says, Is not this great Babylon which I have build by  my mighty power! (4:30). God was so displeased with his pride and his failure to use  his mind to acknowledge God that he was driven from among men, and ate grass like an  ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles'  feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws (4:33).     Then come the key words: At the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes  to heaven [that is, to God], and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and  praised and honored him who lives forever. When your eyes are Godward, your reason  returns. Why? Because your mind was made for God. And when Nebuchadnezzar's reason  returns, he uses it as God intended: he blessed and praised and glorified the One  who lives for ever.     This is why Paul says that all speculations and thinking are futile when God is not  glorified and thanked, but rather exchanged for images. Futility means vain, empty,  useless - and that is what the mind becomes when it is no longer used to know God and love  God and treasure and honor God. It doesn't matter if you are the most brilliant scientist  or artist or engineer. Everything you do with your mind, minus God, is futile and empty  and vain. 1 Corinthians 3:20: The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they  are useless.     Don't exchange God for other things. All your thinking will become futile and empty and  have no lasting significance.    2.  The exchange of God's glory for images is accompanied by darkness of heart    Verse 21b: They became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was  darkened. Why is the heart darkened when people exchange the glory of God for other  things? The answer is that the only light in the universe that can fill the heart with  light is the glory of God.     Compare physical light with spiritual light, which is what Jesus did in Matthew 6:22.  Jesus said there, The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear,  your whole body will be full of light. In other words -there is no light-producing  element in the body; all light comes from outside; the eye must be good if any of this  light is to get into the body and let the body see.     So it is with the heart and the spiritual light which God designed to fill it. There is  no light-producing element in the heart. All light comes from outside, namely, from the  glory of God. (Not from the sun - we are not talking about physical light, but spiritual  light.) Jesus is the spiritual Light of the world (John 14:6) because he is the  glory as of the only begotten from the Father (John 1:14). Paul prays that the  eyes of our hearts would be enlightened because only the prayer-hearing God  can enlighten the heart (Ephesians 1:19). And in 2 Corinthians 4:6, Paul says, God,  who said, 'Light shall shine out of darkness,' is the One who has shone in our hearts to  give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.    The only light in the universe that can bring light to the heart is the glory of God.  If we exchange it for other things, we will live in darkness, no matter how brilliant we  are or how many fires we may build or candles we may light.    3.  The exchange of God's glory for other things is always felt to be wise by those who  make the exchange    Verse 22: Professing to be wise, they became fools. To the natural man,  apart from grace, and darkened in heart, nothing seems more obvious than that it is more  wise to design your own god than to take what you are given. What could be more obviously  wise, he says, than to make your own god? The advantages abound: it shows that you are  resourceful and that you are creative and intelligent. All of that clearly makes your ego  feel good. But best of all, making your own god makes you independent and keeps you in  control. You pull the strings. In other words, making your own god lets you be god. And  what could be wiser than the choice to be god?    Satan said to Eve in the garden, 'God knows that in the day you eat from [the  forbidden tree], your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and  evil.' When the woman saw that the tree . . . was desirable to make one wise [Romans  1:22!], she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he  ate (Genesis 3:5-6). This is the way it was from the beginning and still is. If you  want to assume the role of God in governing your life, you will perceive this dark  exchange - idolatry - as the wisest thing in the world.    4.  However, Paul says, at the end of verse 22, Professing to be wise, they became  fools - the dark exchange is foolish, even if it looks wise    That is the fourth observation about the dark exchange of God's glory for other things.  It is foolish to exchange God for images. It is foolish to create your own god or be your  own god. It is foolish to lean on futile speculations and to walk in darkness.     Why? Why is this dark exchange of God for images so foolish? Paul gives at least three  answers in verse 23, and we will close by looking at two of them (in verse 23) and save  the third for next week (in verses 24-27). My prayer is that this will stir you up to  fight against this dark exchange in your own heart, and that you will help other people do  the same (which is what evangelism and small groups are about).    4.1.  First, Paul shows that the exchange is foolish by emphasizing the infinite  difference in value between what you trade away and what you get in its place. The glory  of God is of infinite value and what you get in the exchange is infinitesimally small by  comparison.     Look how he shows this. Verse 23: In their folly they exchanged the glory of the  incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man. Literally it reads:  They exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for a likeness of an image of  corruptible man. Now notice: man himself is already, according to Genesis 1:27, an  image of God and not God. But that is not what the exchange of God gets. No, not even  that. Rather it is for an image of man. No, not even that. It is for a likeness of  an image of man who is himself an image.     Do you see what Paul is doing by piling up words like this? He is emphasizing the  infinite difference in value between the real and the copy. And he does it by saying: When  you make this exchange - even for the best thing you can think of, namely, man - yourself  - (not to mention animals!) you are bartering God for the image of an image of an image.  You sell the original masterpiece for a copy of a copy of a copy.    We live in a dying and sick culture where you will hear and read the boast -not the  shameful confession, but the boast -that image is everything. Well, over  against that, the Bible says, the glory of God is everything, and to exchange him for  anything is to lose the greatest treasure in the world for an image of an image of an  image. That is futile and dark and foolish. Flee from it. Rescue people from it. Don't be  afraid to name it.     4.2. The second way Paul shows that this dark exchange is foolish is by observing that  the glory of God is incorruptible and man is corruptible.    Verse 23: They exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for a likeness of an  image of corruptible man. Corruptible means perishable. God lasts forever. But man?  Isaiah says, Surely man is grass. The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word  of our God stands forever (Isaiah 40:7-8).    If you value other things more than God, if your life is really driven by another  value, then you exchange the imperishable for the perishable. You trade the diamond for a  peach forgotten at the back of the refrigerator. You trade the ruby for a banana sitting  in the sun. You trade a bar of gold for a bolt rusting in the rain.    Let's do the opposite, along with the apostle Paul. Let's count everything else as  rubbish that we might gain Christ. Let the world call it folly. It is not. Let's be like  Secretary of State William Seward in 1867 who helped America buy Alaska from the Russians  for $7,200,000. O the ridicule of the people: Seward's folly, they called it.  Exchanging seven million dollars for ice!    Well in the last 130 years Alaska has yielded billions upon billions of dollars in  resources to America. Things are not what they seem. I plead with you. Open your eyes. And  do not exchange your God for anything. Exchange everything for him.    Copyright 1998 John Piper     Piper's Notes
