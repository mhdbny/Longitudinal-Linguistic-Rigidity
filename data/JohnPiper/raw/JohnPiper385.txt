       WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE?    "At Home with the Lord"    (2 Corinthians 4:16-5:10)        Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our      outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day      by day. For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an      eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we      look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which      are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but      the things which are not seen are eternal. For we know that if      the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a      building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the      heavens. For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be      clothed with our dwelling from heaven; inasmuch as we, having      put it on, shall not be found naked. For indeed while we are in      this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to      be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal      may be swallowed up by life. Now He who prepared us for this      very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.      Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while      we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord-for we      walk by faith, not by sight-we are of good courage, I say, and      prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with      the Lord. Therefore also we have as our ambition, whether at      home or absent, to be pleasing to Him. For we must all appear      before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be      recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has      done, whether good or bad.         
       Today I want to begin a five-week series entitled, "What   Happens When You Die?" By "you" I mean believers in Jesus Christ.   If you are not a believer, the aim of these messages is to wake   you up from the slumber of indifference to the question of death   and eternity and to motivate you to consider Jesus Christ as the   only way to eternal life and the only escape from hell and eternal   death. "I am the way the truth and the life, no one comes to the   Father but by me" (John 14:6). There is no other way to God.       In this sermon I will try to answer from Scripture the   question, "What happens immediately at the moment of death?" In   the following four weeks the questions will be:       What happens to you at the coming of Christ?       What happens to believers at the Judgment?       What is our final place: a distant heaven, or the new earth   where lions and lambs lie down in peace?       What is the most essential bridge that links this life and the   next?       There is a long list of reasons why this theme seems crucial to   me for our consideration. Let me mention a few of them:       1. The possibilities for joy and misery after you die are   trillions of times greater than in the few years on this earth   before you die. The Bible compares this life to a vapor that   appears as you breathe on a cold winter morning and then vanishes   (James 4:14). The Bible describes the time after death as "ages of   ages." Not just one or two ages of thousands of years, but ages of   ages; thousands and thousands of ages (Rev. 14:11). It matters   infinitely what happens to you after you die.       2. This theme forces the question as to whether our faith is   real, substantial, biblical, faith in objective, external reality   outside ourselves. Namely, is our faith in God or is it a mere   subjective experience of feelings and thoughts inside ourselves   that function as an emotional cushion to soften the bumps of life   and give us a network of friends. Facing eternity has an amazing   effect of sobering us out of religious delusions.       3. Thinking about death and eternity helps keep God as the   center of our lives by testing whether we are more in love with   this world than we are in love with God himself. Does the thought   of dying give us more pain at losing what we love on earth than it   gives us joy at gaining Christ?       4. When the Biblical truth of this theme grips you it frees you   from fear and gives courage to live the most radical,   self-sacrificing life of love. The person who can truly say, "To   die is gain," will be able to say like no one else, "To live is   Christ" (Phil. 1:21). But if you can't say, "To die is gain," then   you will you will probably say, in one degree or another, "Let us   eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die" (1 Cor. 15:32).   Being sure of what happens when you die is indispensable as a   believer in Christ for your daily courage and for not losing heart   through the pain and the diminishing health of this life.       That brings us to our text.       What Paul is doing in 2 Corinthians 4:16 - 5:10 is showing the   Corinthians why he does not lose heart in spite of all the   troubles and afflictions (4:8-12). Especially in view of the fact   that he knows he is dying; his body is wearing away. Look at   4:16--"Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is   decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."       It is utterly crucial that we not lose heart. Some of you have   taken such a pounding physically and financially and relationally   that you have often been tempted to "loose heart"; to give up. To   say, "It isn't worth it." "Que sera, sera". "Who cares?" Paul   faced the same temptation (vv 8-12) and this text holds one of the   keys to why he did not lose heart.       To show that this really is crucial to his point here look at   verses 6 and 8 of chapter five which is part of the same train of   thought. Verse 6: "Therefore, being always of good courage . . ."   Verse 8: "We are of good courage, I say." We'll come back to these   verses in moment, but the point now is simply to show you that   what Paul is doing here is giving the basis of being of good   courage and not losing heart. That is the effect I would like it   to have on you.       Now let's go back to 4:16 and follow his line of thought to see   what is threatening to make Paul lose heart and lose courage, and   what is keeping him from losing heart.       Verse 16: "Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer   man is decaying . . ." Here is the threat he is dealing with: His   body--"the outer man"--is decaying; it is wearing out. He can't   see the way he used to (and there were probably no glasses). He   can't hear the way he used to. He does not recover from beatings   the way he used to. His strength walking from town to town does   not hold up the way it used to. He sees the wrinkles in his face   and neck. His memory is not as good. His joints get stiff when he   sits still. In other words, he knows that he, like everybody else,   is dying. His outer man is decaying. That's the threat to his   courage and joy.       Now why doesn't he lose heart?       The first part of the answer is again in verse 16: "Therefore   we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet   our inner man is being renewed day by day." He doesn't lose heart   because day by day his heart, his inner man, is being renewed. If   his decaying body tends to make him lose heart, something else   tends to make him gain heart. What is it?       His renewed heart comes from something very strange: it comes   from looking at what he can't see. Verse 18: "We look not at the   things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for   the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are   not seen are eternal." This is Paul's way of not losing heart:   looking at what you can't see.       Recall how Jesus criticized the religious leaders in his day:   "Seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear" (Matt.   13:13). In other words there was something to "see" in Jesus' life   and teaching which they didn't see but should have seen. That has   got to be reversed if we are to get our hope and our courage from   Jesus and not lose heart. It has to be said of us, "Not seeing,   they see; and not hearing, they hear. That's what Paul was doing   in verse 18; he was looking at things that are not seen."       Paul illustrates this in chapter 5, verse 7: "We walk by faith,   not by sight." This doesn't mean that we leap into the dark   without evidence of what's there. But it does mean that the most   precious and important realities in the world are beyond our   senses now, and we "look" at them (v. 18) through what we know of   Christ from faithful witnesses who have seen him and heard his   voice. We strengthen our hearts--we renew our courage--by fixing   the gaze of our hearts on invisible, objective truth that we learn   about through the testimony of those who knew Christ and were   taught by him (cf. Eph 1:18-23).       What truth? What do we fix our gaze on to experience day by day   the renewal of the inner man in the face of death?       To answer this we look back to verse 17 for a powerful summary   statement, and we look forward into chapter 5 for the unpacking of   this summary statement.       Verse 17: We renew our inner man each day by looking at this   truth: "Momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal   weight of glory far beyond all comparison."       The decaying of your body is not meaningless. The pain,   pressure, frustration and affliction are not happening in vain.   They are not vanishing into a black hole of pointless suffering.   Instead this "momentary, light affliction (he calls it that even   though it lasted for years and was unremitting and often   excruciating) is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far   beyond all comparison."       In other words, the unseen things that Paul looks at to renew   his inner man is the immense weight of glory that is being   prepared for him not just after, but through and by, the wasting   away of his body. There is a correlation between the decay of the   Paul's body and the display of Paul's glory. When he is hurting he   fixes his eyes not on how heavy the hurt is, but on how heavy the   glory will be because of the hurt.       Now what does he see when he looks to the unseen glory? As he   goes on in chapter five he fills in some what he sees as he looks   at the unseen.       Now the next two messages concern these verses: the   resurrection body and the judgment of believers. But neither of   these is the focus of this message. So if I pass over something   too quickly, read the next sermon.       Verses 1-5 are about the hope of receiving new, glorious bodies   at the resurrection. Verses 9-10 are about the judgment and Paul's   effort to please Christ the Judge. Our focus is on verses 6-8, the   hope of being with Christ immediately when you die.       But let me read you the verses about the resurrection body   because there is a crucial connection between this hope and the   hope of being with Christ (without a new body) immediately when   you die. Verses 1-5:        For we know that if the earthly tent which is our      house is torn down  &#91;he's talking about his body which      is decaying&#93;,  we have a building from God  &#91;a      building as opposed to a tent for a house--that is, something      more durable and lasting, namely, a new resurrection      body&#93; , a house not made with hands, eternal in the      heavens. For indeed in this house  &#91;this "tent-house,"      our present body&#93;  we groan, longing to be clothed with      our dwelling from heaven  &#91;that is, our resurrection      body; he mixes metaphors here shifting back and forth now      between being clothed and being housed&#93; ; inasmuch as      we, having put it on, shall not be found naked  &#91;in      other words, he does not prefer to put off his present body      like a garment and become a disembodied soul--that's what      nakedness means&#93; . For indeed while we are in this tent       &#91;this mortal body&#93; , we groan, being burdened,      because we do not want to be unclothed  &#91;we don't want      to be a bodiless soul&#93; , but to be clothed  &#91;on      top of our present clothes--he wants the second coming of      Christ to happen so that he will not have to die and be without      a body, but rather have his present body swallowed up in the      glorious resurrection life of the new body&#93; , in order      that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now He who      prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the      Spirit as a pledge.          We'll talk more about this in the next message. For now, here's   the crucial point: If Paul had his preference he would choose to   receive his new resurrection body at the second coming of Christ   without having to die. And the reason he gives is that the   experience of "nakedness"--that is being stripped of his body--is   not something as good as having his body swallowed up by life as   he is changed in the twinkling of an eye at the second coming of   Christ.       This means that the great final hope of the Christian is not to   die and be freed from our bodies, but to be raised with new,   glorious bodies, or, best of all, to be alive at the second coming   so that we do not have to lose our body temporarily and be "naked"   (souls without bodies, cf. Mt. 10:28; Rev. 6:9; Heb. 12:23) until   the resurrection.       But does that mean that dying and going to be with Christ does   not happen, or that it is not good? No. Paul puts things back in   perspective again in verses 6-8.       Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while   we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord &#91;the   full intimacy we long for is not possible here&#93;--for we walk   by faith, not by sight-- we are of good courage, I say, and prefer   rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.       Now get this. In verse 4 Paul says, "He does not want to be   unclothed." His first preference is not to be "absent from the   body." He says that in comparison to being over-clothed with the   new resurrection body if he is alive at the second coming of   Christ. That would be his first preference. But if that is not   possible--if the choice is between more life here by faith and   going to be with Christ--he prefers that God would take him; EVEN   IF it means nakedness, that is, even if it means that he must be   stripped of his body.       And the reason for this willingness to leave his body behind is   not because the body is bad--O, how he wants the experience of the   new resurrection body--but because being at home with the Lord is   so irresistibly attractive to Paul. Verse 8: "I prefer rather to   be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord."       Summary       So Paul renews his inner man by looking to unseen things. He   looks at three possibilities and prefers them in descending order.   First, he prefers that Christ would come and clothe his mortal   body with immortality so that he would not have to die and be an   incomplete, disembodied soul. But if God does not will that, Paul   prefers to be absent from the body to living on here, because he   loves Christ more than he loves anything else. To be absent from   the body will mean to be at home with the Lord; a deeper intimacy   and greater at-homeness than anything we can know in this life.   Finally, if God wills that it is not time for the second coming or   time for death, then Paul will walk by faith and not by sight.       In that faith he will be of good courage and, even though his   outer man is decaying, his inner man will be renewed day by day   through this faith in the unseen weight of glory.       Examine yourself. Do you share these biblical priorities and   values in life?. Do you long mainly for the second coming? And   secondly, do you long to be at home with Christ even if it costs   you the surrender of your body? Third, are you committed to walk   by faith until he comes or until he calls?
