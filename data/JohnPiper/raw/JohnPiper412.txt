  June 26, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       Christ died for our sins    That we might die to sin    (1 Peter 2:21-25)       For you have been called for thispurpose, since      Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to      follow in His steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit      found in His mouth; and while being reviled, He did not revile      in return; while suffering He uttered no threats, but kept      entrusting Himself to him who judges righteously; and He      Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, that we might      die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you      were healed. For you were continually straying like sheep, but      now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your      souls.        Introduction       I told Tom before I left last week that I was eager for him to   go ahead with the planning of the summer preaching series on the   "one another" commands of the New Testament. I said that I thought   my sermon this morning could be seen as a kind of foundation for   those commands. Before I go on vacation and take some writing   leave I wanted to finish at least the second chapter of 1 Peter.   So our focus this morning is on the last paragraph of that   chapter.       When I began the series on 1 Peter last September I had no idea   what was about to happen to us as a church. It has been far more   hurtful than if several of our staff had died. Sometimes the texts   from 1 Peter seemed exactly right. Other times it seemed that the   Lord had some other word for us.       So here we are at the end of chapter two as just another   testimony to how many precious things have been cut short in these   months. But that's not the main thing we see here at the end of 1   Peter 2. The main thing in this text is God's word to us about his   purpose for Bethlehem and what he did to accomplish and assure   that purpose. And nothing that has happened to us can thwart God's   purpose for his people.       So what I hope you hear this morning from this text is a   massive, unshakable, infinitely compelling commitment from God to   bring about his good purpose for us. And I hope you see that this   purpose has to do with the "one another" commands and how we treat   each other.       The Purpose of Christ's Death: That We Might Live Righteously       Three times in this text Peter tells us that Christ died and   that the purpose of his death was to enable us to live   differently. Or another way to put it is that he tells us that   God's purpose for us as a church is that we live like Christ, that   we live righteously; and he tells us three times that his   unshakable, infinitely compelling commitment to fulfill that   purpose in us is the death of his Son to make it happen. His   commitment to make it happen is seen in the sacrifice of his Son   to make it happen.       Let me point out these three statements of purpose and three   statements of God's commitment to make it happen through the death   of Jesus.       1. First, verse 21: "Christ also suffered for you, leaving you   an example for you to follow in His steps." Literally: "Christ   also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you might   follow in his steps."       In other words Christ suffered for us -- he suffered even unto   death -- for this purpose: that we might follow in his steps. So   God's purpose for us is that we follow in the steps of Jesus. And   enabling power behind that purpose is that Christ "suffered for   us." Christ didn't just suffer and die to give us an example. He   suffered "for us," that is, in our place, on our behalf.       And in suffering "for us" he showed his commitment and God the   Father's commitment to bring their purpose for us to pass.   Something happened in the death of Christ "for us" that guarantees   its success in bringing us to follow in Christ's steps. The   purpose is that we live like Christ. The power is the   substitutionary death of Jesus. He died for us to make us like   him.       And living like him includes all the "one another" commands of   the New Testament. That's why I see all of this as foundational   for the summer series.       2. Second, verse 24a: "He Himself bore our sins in His body on   the cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness."       Here it is again: the purpose of God for us, and the commitment   of God behind the purpose backed up by the death of Jesus for us.   God's purpose for us is stated like this: "that we might die to   sin and live to righteousness." God's commitment to make it happen   is stated like this: "He Himself bore our sins in His body on the   cross."       So the thought seems to be identical to the thought in verse   21, only things are made more explicit. Peter says very clearly   what he meant in verse 21 by "Christ suffered for you." He meant,   "Christ bore our sins in his body on the cross." Christ's   suffering was the agony of being nailed to the cross and dying   there. And his suffering "for us" was his bearing our sins. It was   a substitution. He bore them in death instead of our having to   bear them in death. It's the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:6, "All we   like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own   way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all." That   is, "Christ bore our sins in his body."       You remember how Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:1,3, "I remind   you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you the gospel . . .   that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures."   That's what Peter is spelling out here in language taken from   those scriptures: Christ bore our sins in his body on the cross;   that is, he died for our sins according to Isaiah 53:6.       This is tremendously good news for sinners! It is the only hope   for a church that has come through what we have come through.   Christ bore our sins. He bore Leah's sins and Dean's sins and my   sins and your sins -- all the sins of his people. And while the   ongoing consequences of our sins are unbelievably painful, the   hope of our lives and our church and our families is "Christ bore   our sins in his body on the cross."       We need to linger here. Do you believe this about your own sins   and about the sins of your brothers and sisters? The implications   of this for us individually and as a church are huge. It means   that, if we will, we can leave the past with God. We can say, "I   trust you, Jesus, that all my sins; all the ones that are public   and all the ones that are private, all of them, have been lifted,   borne, suffered for and therefore removed from me. I bear them no   more. I do not carry their guilt into the future with me."       Let this sink in. You do not have to carry your sins or be   burdened by them. You do not have to wake up with guilt or go to   bed with guilt. You can bank your hope on the commitment of God in   Jesus: "Christ bore our sins in his body on the cross." Let's do   that together as a church. Do it this morning even if you are not   part of this church.       But notice again clearly what God's aim is in this   guilt-lifting death of Jesus on the cross (v. 24): ". . . that we   might die to sin and live to righteousness." This corresponds with   the purpose mentioned in verse 21: "that you might follow in his   steps." Following in Jesus' steps is the same as living to   righteousness.       In both cases -- the vicarious suffering of Jesus in verse 21,   and the substitutionary death of Jesus in verse 24 -- are given as   the means that God intends to use to make us righteous like his   Son.       Now this is so important and so forceful in this text we need   to pause here a moment. Does this feel like good news to you? Or   does it feel like the good news of the cross is being given with   one hand and taken away with the other. Does it feel like good   news that the message of the cross on the one hand is a lifting of   guilt and on the other hand is a laying on of burden?       On the one hand the suffering and death of Jesus are "for us"   and "bear our sins away" -- that feels liberating and joyful and   hopeful. On the other hand the suffering and death of Jesus are   designed by God to create people who follow in Jesus' footsteps   and who live to righteousness.       There are many people today who feel the first work of the   cross as liberating good news and the who feel the second as   burdensome bad news. For them, the grace of the cross is one   thing: liberation from guilt and shame. And when they hear that   the grace of the cross is not just liberation from the guilt of   sin, but is also liberation from the power of sin, it doesn't feel   as good.       Now there are all kinds of reasons for this, ranging from   rebellion in the heart to painful memories from the past to   theological misunderstandings. I don't have time to analyze all   those reasons. What I want to do is simply stress that the design   of the cross to liberate from the enslaving power of sin as well   as the guilt of sin does not diminish the good news; it doubles   it.       Would it really be good news if the Bible taught that the death   of Christ took away the guilt of sin and left us enslaved to its   power? If that sounds like good news to you -- that you could go   on living the way the world does, only without punishment, then   what it shows is that you love sin and not God. But if you long to   be set free not only from the guilt of sin by the cross, but also   from the enslaving power of sin by the cross, then these verses   don't diminish the good news, they double it.       What verse 24a is saying is that when Christ bore our sins in   his body on the cross he secured not only the removal of our   guilt, but also release from our bondage. Christ bore our sins in   his body that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. That   is the design and purpose and commitment of God in the cross. That   is what he commits himself to in the new covenant.       You might think: maybe its just an offer instead of an   achievement. Maybe the cross really doesn't secure and guarantee   anything for us, but only offer something to us.       3. The third and final statement of the purpose of the cross in   this text makes that very unlikely. Verse 24b, again quoting   Isaiah 53 (v.5): "By His wounds you were healed." It does not say:   By his wounds healing is offered. Or: By his wounds healing is a   possibility. It says, "By his wounds you were healed." In other   words the cross is efficacious. It achieves what God designs for   it to achieve. The cross does not merely create new possibilities;   it creates new persons.       Now Peter is not thinking here mainly of physical healing for   cancer and arthritis and so on. As a matter of fact the cross will   one day accomplish that in our lives whether here or in the age to   come. But that is not Peter's thinking at all here.       He explains in verse 25 what he has in mind by the healing that   the suffering and death and wounds of Christ accomplish: namely, a   spiritual healing that sheds tremendously important light on what   we have seen so far.       Verse 25: "For you were continually straying like sheep, but   now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."   This is the healing Peter has in mind: the return of straying,   perishing sheep to their Guide and Provider and Keeper.       So here is the third statement of the design and purpose of the   cross. The first in verse 21 was that Christ died so that we would   follow in his footsteps. The second in verse 24a was that Christ   died so that we would live to righteousness. The third in verse   24b-25 is that Christ died so that he might bring straying sheep   home to the green pastures of the Good Shepherd.       Now I ask, is this good news? Is it good news that the design   and purpose of the cross is not only to save us from the guilt of   sin, but also from the power of sin? I hope you see that Peter   wants you to feel it as good news by the way he describes it in   verse 25: the word of the cross brings us to a shepherd not a   slave master. Yes, the Shepherd guides. He does not let sheep   stray very far or very long. He uses a rod and staff when he must.   He Provides. He protects. And he relentlessly pursues us with   goodness and mercy all our days. His commitment to do this is   signed with the blood of Jesus. It is the New Covenant, sealed   with the blood of the Covenant.       What Does It Mean to Die to Sin?       And I ask one other question before we leave this text. What   does it mean to die to sin (v. 24a)? I wait until now to ask that   question because I get the answer from Peter's word about the   Shepherd in verse 25.       Verse 24a says that "Christ bore our sins in his body on the   cross that we might die to sin." What does that mean in our   experience? How does that happen?       I think it works like this: When the word of the cross breaks   into our heart by the power of God's Spirit (cf. 1:3, 23), and we   awaken to the fact that God loves us so much that he takes the   life of his own Son in order to bring us under his Shepherd-care   and Shepherd-protection and Shepherd-provision and   Shepherd-guidance, at that moment we die to the lie of sin. We die   to the power of sin's deceit which tries to persuade us that a   better future can be had through sin than through righteousness.       What causes our death to sin is the work of the cross   convincing us in the depth of our heart that God is committed to   us like a mighty Shepherd. We are alive to sin, and believing in   sin and following sin, until the cross unleashes on us the   conquering love of God and constrains us to see that we are   straying; we are erring; we are self-destructing in the path of   sin. And when the cross releases that power in us, we die to sin.   And we awaken to the beauty of righteousness in the pasture of our   all-satisfying Shepherd.       Consider the design of the cross for your life this morning.   Embrace it and return to the Shepherd and Guardian of your soul.   And what we will find unleashed if we do this is the will and joy   of all the "one another" commands of the New Testament, and the   power to move forward out of our guilt and hurt as a church.
