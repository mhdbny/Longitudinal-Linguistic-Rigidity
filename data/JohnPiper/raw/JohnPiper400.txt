      February 13, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       Good and Evil in the Churches of Asia    and Bethlehem    (Revelation 2,3)       When a tragedy comes into the life of a Christian one of the   most natural and healthy reactions is to look for some similar   experience in the Bible and how God dealt with it. This is   especially true when the tragedy is sin.       How many robbers have looked to the thief on the cross to find   hope.    How many adulterers have looked to king David to find hope.    How many murderers have looked to the apostle Paul to find   hope.    How many people who have denied Christ have looked to Peter to   find hope.    How many prostitutes have looked for hope to the woman who wiped   Jesus' feet with her tears and her hair.    How many crooked businessmen have looked to Zacchaeus for   hope.    How many demonized people have glimpsed dimly a ray of hope in the   Gadarene demoniac sitting in his right mind.       When tragedy strikes our lives we desperately want to see   Biblical examples of people like us who made it -- broken,   contrite, repentant, forgiven, renewed -- sent on our way to   freedom.       And it's the same with churches. At least that's the way I feel   these days. I want to know if what has happened to us as a church   has any precedent in Scripture. Are there stories of hope not just   about people, but about churches? Is there hope for a church that   has been so deceived? Is there hope for a pastoral staff (for me!)   that did not see more and act sooner? Is there hope for a church   when our worship has been so desecrated? Can God bless a church   like ours? And we ask -- especially those of us who have given our   lives to this church -- was our worship in vain? Is there a story   in the Bible for us?       What I want to do this morning is not any detailed exposition.   I simply want to point you to the place in the Bible where we can   find some churches a little bit like us, and where we might find   hope for Bethlehem.       The place in Revelation 2-3 where the risen Jesus speaks   through the apostle John to the seven churches of Asia Minor. What   struck me as I read the letters again was not merely that four of   them were threatened by sexual sin, but that Jesus told four of   them that he had something against them, but that not everything   they did was in vain. That's what grabbed me. Here we have four   churches, and the Lord Jesus comes to them and says, "This you do   well, but I have something serious against you -- this you do not   do well."       And in this I have found hope. Let me show you what I mean.       Two of the seven churches get only commendations from Jesus and   no criticisms: the church at Smyrna (2:8ff) and the church at   Philadelphia (3:7ff). One of the churches gets only criticism and   no commendations: the church at Laodicia (3:14ff). But four of the   church get mixed reviews. Jesus approves some things and he   disapproves of others: the churches at Ephesus (2:1ff), Pergamum   (2:12ff), Thyatira (2:18ff) and Sardis (3:1ff).       And all four Jesus calls to repent and threatens terrible   things if they don't. For example,       to Ephesus: ". . . else I am coming to you, and will remove   your lamp stand" (2:5);    to Pergamum: "I will make war against them with the sword of my   mouth" (2:16);    to Thyatira: "I will cast her upon a bed of sickness . . ."   (2:22);    to Sardis: "If you will not wake up I will come like a thief and   you will not know at what hour I come upon you" (3:3).       These are all merciful warnings to wake the churches up. They   are all mixed -- not that there is any perfect church - but these   are evidently so badly mixed that their very existence is   threatened.       Let's just look how each of these four churches is mixed and   how the Lord talks about the good and the bad.       The church at Ephesus:       First Jesus says what he approves (Rev. 2:2-3, 6):        2 I know your deeds and your toil andperseverance,      and that you cannot endure evil men, and you put to the test      those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you      found them to be false; 3 and you have perseverance and have      endured for My name's sake, and have not grown weary . . . 6      Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the      Nicolaitans, which I also hate. (We'll see what these deeds are      when we look at the church atPergamum.)         Then Jesus says in verse 4 what he has against them: "But I   have this against you, that you have left your first love."       So their hatred of evil and their vigilance against the   deceptive false apostles and their perseverance is good. Jesus   commends them for it. But all the while their deeds of love are   drying up, and he holds that against them.       When we get to the church of Thyatira we will see the exact   opposite error: not love drying up under vigilance against sin (as   here), but sin flourishing under the tolerance of love.       The church at Pergamum:       First Jesus tells them what he approves (Rev. 2:13):        13 'I know where you dwell, where Satan'sthrone is;      and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith, even in      the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was      killed among you, where Satan dwells.         So Jesus strongly commends their Christ-centered courage even   unto death. But then in verses 14-15 he says,        14 But I have a few things against you,because you      have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept      teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of      Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit acts      of immorality. 15 Thus you also have some who in the same way      hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.         So now we see what this Nicolaitan stuff is: its a teaching   that somehow encourages idolatry and sexual immorality. Some in   the church were promoting this, even while others were laying   their lives down for the gospel.       The church at Thyatira:       First, in Rev. 2:19 Jesus commends them:        19 I know your deeds, and your love andfaith and      service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are      greater than at first.         Now notice that this is the opposite of the church at Ephesus.   To Ephesus Jesus said: you have left your first love. Here he   says, "I know your love . . . that your deeds of late are greater   than at first."       So what could he have against them? Rev. 2:20-23:        20 'But I have this against you, that youtolerate the      woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches      and leads My bond-servants astray, so that they commit acts of      immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. 21 And I gave      her time to repent; and she does not want to repent of her      immorality. 22 Behold, I will cast her upon a bed of sickness,      and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation,      unless they repent of her deeds. 23 And I will kill her      children with pestilence; and all the churches will know that I      am He who searches the minds andhearts;         So in Ephesus they hated the deeds of the Nicolaitans (2:6) --   these deeds, Jezebel was probably a prophetess in this faction in   the church. But while they hated the immorality of the Nicolaitans   their first love was drying up. Here in Thyatira it was the   opposite: their love was greater than at the first but they   tolerated flagrant immorality.       But not everyone is guilty for this. Verse 24 says,        But I say to you, the rest who are inThyatira, who do      not hold this teaching (of the Nicolaitans), who have not known      the deep things of Satan, as they call them -- I place no other      burden on you.         What I hear from these two churches is that walking in the   light of love and truth is not a simple thing. It is fraught with   dangers on all hands -- just like John Bunyan shows it to be on   all hands ("Dangerous Journey"!). It seems that for some the path   of love is so simple. Sometimes I envy them.       For me it is not simple. It takes tremendous spiritual insight   to know when to be tough in vigilance and when to be tender in   tolerance. In the one direction lurks the Ephesian indictment: you   have left your first love. In the other direction lurks the other   indictment: you tolerate adultery.       Jesus clearly does not want us to choose between these two, but   to avoid them both: love and vigilance, tough and tender, truth   and grace. This is our calling and it is not easy.       The church at Sardis:       Jesus starts this time (in 3:1b) with what he disapproves of:        1 I know your deeds, that you have a namethat you are      alive, but you are dead. 2 Wake up, and strengthen the things      that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your      deeds completed in the sight of MyGod.         Nevertheless, even this church that seems all but dead hears   Jesus say in verse 4:        4 But you have a few people in Sardis whohave not      soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white; for      they are worthy.         Now here's the point. Jesus did not write any of these churches   off. He said the day may come when he would write them off -- make   war on them with the sword of his mouth, come against them like a   thief, bring them into sickness, and, if necessary, take away   their candlestick -- put them out of existence. But not yet. He   gave them all time to repent.       "The Lord is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and   faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands and forgiving   iniquity and transgression and sin" (Ex. 34:6-7). That goes for   people like and you and me. And it goes for churches like   Bethlehem.       There is hope for us and our church, and I invite you to affirm   it with me by singing Hymn 517, "My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less,   than Jesus Blood and Righteousness."
