 June 7, 1998    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor           THE GOSPEL IN THE CHURCH FOR THE OBEDIENCE    OF FAITH THROUGH SPIRITUAL GIFTS (Romans 1:8-15)             First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you      all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the      whole world. 9 For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the      preaching of the gospel of His Son, is my witness as to how      unceasingly I make mention of you, 10 always in my prayers      making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may      succeed in coming to you. 11 For I long to see you so that I      may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be      established; 12 that is, that I may be encouraged together with      you while among you, each of us by the other's faith, both      yours and mine. 13 I do not want you to be unaware, brethren,      that often I have planned to come to you (and have been      prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you      also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles. 14 I am under      obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise      and to the foolish. 15 So, for my part, I am eager to preach      the gospel to you also who are in Rome.               How Do You Get into Debt?        Focus with me for a few moments on verse 14: "I am under   obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and   to the foolish ." More literally, "I am debtor . . ." (KJV). What   is his debt? The next verse probably gives the answer (verse 15):   "So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who   are in Rome." So the debt seems to be preaching the gospel. That's   his obligation or his debt.        Now the reason I think it's important to focus on the word   "debtor" in verse 14 ("I am debtor to Greeks and to barbarians")   is that it makes us ponder how you get into such a debt and how   you pay it off.        It may be that you would say, Well, verse 1 shows that Paul was   "called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God," and verse   5 says that Paul "received grace and apostleship to bring about   the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles;" so what could be   clearer? He is obligated as a called apostle to preach the gospel   to the gentiles to bring about the obedience of faith. It's an   obligation created by the command of the risen Christ. You are   obligated to do what you are told to do by your Lord.        That's true. But what Paul stresses about his calling is not   that it is a command, but that it is grace. Verse 5: "we received   grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith." So I   think it is helpful to ask if there is something deeper to see   here than just: Christ said it, so do it: that's your obligation,   your debt.            By Borrowing or Stealing        Note carefully: verse 14 says Paul is a debtor to other people,   not God. "I am debtor to the Greeks and to the barbarians."   Usually we get into debt because someone has loaned us something.   But the Greeks and Barbarians have not loaned Paul anything. The   situation is not that the nations have loaned Paul anything to be   paid back. The situation is that God has freely given Paul   something, namely, grace (verse 5: "we received grace") - both the   grace of salvation and the grace of apostleship. But when you   receive grace from God, you don't become a debtor to God. Grace   cannot and must not be paid back as a debt. Otherwise grace would   no longer be grace. If I give you a free gift and you try to pay   me for it, you turn it into a merited purchase, not a free gift.   So grace does not create debt in this sense.        In fact, the best thing about grace is that it pays debts. We   are debtors to God ("Forgive us our debts as we forgive our   debtors," Matthew 6:12). God's grace forgives debts. We are   debtors to God not because he has given us grace, but because we   have stolen his glory. Stealing also makes you a debtor. Instead   of seeing the glory of God as a treasure to enjoy, we exchanged it   for other things that we really like better (Romans 1:23; 3:23).   And so we stole it. That is the essence of sin. And that is the   kind of debt we have toward God.        So when grace comes to us from God in the gospel, it comes to   pay our debts that we have to him. Grace does not make you a   debtor to God; but it does make you a debtor to others who need   grace just as you did. That is what Paul focuses on here in verse   14. "I received grace and apostleship" (verse 5). So now I am a   debtor to Greeks and barbarians. And what I owe them is the gospel   of grace. That's my debt.        The Debt We Owe is the Gospel of Grace        Why is that? Answer: When you hear good news about how to   escape from a common misery, you become a debtor to tell the good   news to others so they can escape the misery too. You owe it to   them. Why? Because if you withhold the good news of grace from   others, as if you were qualified for it, and they were not, then   you show that you have never known grace. The grace of God which   calls us (verse 6) out of our darkness and bestows eternal   covenant-love on us (verse 7) creates what it commands. We don't   qualify for it beforehand.        So if you hold this grace back from others as if you are   qualified and they are not, you default on your debt to the world   and prove that you have not really known grace. Grace is precious   beyond words. It is our only hope as sinners. We don't deserve it   from God. And no one can deserve it from us. When it comes to us   freely, we are debtors to give freely.        That's one reason why Paul stresses his debt, in verse 14,   "both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the   foolish." Culture and intelligence and education do not qualify   you for the gospel of grace. And being unrefined and uneducated   and illiterate do not disqualify you for the gospel of grace.   There are no qualifications for this grace.        Nobody Qualifies for Grace        Paul is not a debtor to anybody because they qualify. Nobody   qualifies for grace. For then grace would not be grace. Paul is a   debtor to Greek and barbarian precisely because he didn't qualify   either, yet grace came to him -and it keeps on coming to him day   after day in endless waves of future grace breaking over his life   (1 Corinthians 15:10). So there is no one who is any less or more   deserving than he. And that makes him a debtor to all.        O, to be gripped by the reality of radically free grace in our   lives -past and future! What a difference it would make! Dwell on   this today, would you? Ponder what it means about racism, ethnic   slurs, and all kinds of self-righteousness, demandingness in   marriage. Ponder what it means about how freely you share the   gospel of grace. O Lord, open our hearts more and more to feel the   wonder of being called of Christ and the loved of God (forever!)-   not because he found something special in us, but because this   grace is utterly and absolutely free.        Now stop and think here for a moment what I just did.        Preaching the Gospel of Grace to Believers        I just took the gospel of grace - the good news that because of   Jesus' death on the cross for sinners and his resurrection from   the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4), free grace breaks on us with wave   after wave -and I applied it to you with the conviction that if   you get it -really get it - that is, if you believe it, if you   have faith in it, if you cherish this grace and live on this   grace, it will make an ever-greater difference in your life in   areas like racism and pride and self-righteousness and   marriage.        To put it in a word, I just preached to you the gospel of   grace. And my aim in this was the "obedience of faith" - the   humility and kindness and courage and patience and love that come   from faith in God's grace. Now why is that important to   notice?        Consider verse 15 and see if this is not what Paul wants to do   in Rome. He says in verse 14 that he is debtor to every layer of   gentile society, and then he says, "So, for my part, I am eager to   preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome." He is eager to   preach the gospel to believers in Rome.        We don't usually think about preaching the gospel to believers.   We preach the gospel to unbelievers. But I just preached the   gospel to believers. So I hope you can see that this is not   strange for Paul to say in verse 15 - that he wants to do this in   Rome. Paul's aim, according to verse 5, is to bring about the   obedience of faith among gentiles. So is mine at Bethlehem. How   does this obedience come about? It comes about through faith -   faith in the free grace of God through Christ. That's why it is   called the "obedience of faith." But how does that kind of faith   come about? It comes about through the gospel. "So faith comes   from hearing, and hearing by the word &#91;the gospel&#93; of   Christ" (Romans 10:17).        Our faith begins with the gospel of grace, and our Christian   lives are sustained by this same good news of grace over and over   again. Look at Romans 15:15-16, "But I have written very boldly to   you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace   that was given me from God, to be a minister of Christ Jesus to   the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that   my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by   the Holy Spirit."        To Bring About the Obedience of Faith        What Paul says here is that he is not merely interested in   getting professions of faith by first-time preaching of the gospel   (as crucial as that is). He is interested in bringing to God the   offering of sanctified gentiles - that is, he wants to bring about   the "obedience of faith" in the gentiles (1:5). And the way he   works toward this end (according to Romans 15:16) is by   "ministering the gospel of God," applying the gospel of God's   grace. It's the gospel of grace that converts and it's the gospel   of grace that sanctifies. We must tell people the gospel the first   time; and we must "remind" people again and again of the meaning   and implications of the gospel of free grace (15:15).        So the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24) is what we preach to   unbelievers, and the gospel of grace is what we preach to   believers. That is what Paul says in Romans 1:15. "I am eager to   preach the gospel to you &#91;believers!&#93; also who are in   Rome." Not to get them saved, but to keep them saved through   sanctification. Our faith feeds off the good news of the grace of   God. And our obedience feeds off of faith. Therefore, to bring   about the obedience of faith, we must hear the gospel of grace   again and again.        So we have seen two things so far. 1) Paul is debtor to Greeks   and to barbarians because he has so freely received the grace of   God in the gospel and in his apostleship. If he doesn't pay his   debt he is treating the gospel as if he qualified for it and they   don't, which means he is denying that it is a gospel of grace. 2)   This gospel of grace is to be preached to believer and unbeliever   alike because faith in free grace saves and faith in free grace   sanctifies. The good news of free grace brings about faith and   faith brings about obedience -all for the sake of the glory of God   (1:5). Because the giver of grace gets the glory.        Is the Preacher the only One Speaking the Gospel of Grace?        One last question: Is it enough for the church that preachers   preach the gospel of grace? Will the obedience of faith flourish   the way it should at Bethlehem if John Piper is the only one   speaking the gospel of grace?        I think this is the question behind verses 11-12, "For I long   to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that   you may be established &#91;namely, in your faith and the   obedience of faith&#93;; that is, that I may be encouraged &#91;in   my faith&#93; together with you while among you, each of us by the   other's faith, both yours and mine."        What's he saying? He is saying: Yes, I am coming with the   gospel of the grace of God. By faith I stand in that grace, and I   live from its power. I will, by faith, share that grace with you   through my spiritual gifts of teaching and preaching, and perhaps,   other gifts. But know this, you stand in that same grace. And you   too live from its power. And you too have spiritual gifts - all of   you. Therefore, share God's grace with me and with each other so   that we are all mutually encouraged and established in faith; and   so that the obedience of faith will flourish in the church and in   the world.        In other words, the answer is No, one man's preaching the   gospel of the grace of God in the church is not enough to bring   about the full measure of the obedience of faith. This is why we   put such a high premium on small groups at Bethlehem. Here is one   of the main places where verses 11 and 12 will happen. God's   design for bringing about the obedience of faith in the church (=   love) is that all believers cherish the grace of God and share it   with each other through spiritual gifts.        Thus Paul says in Romans 12:6-8, "Since we have gifts that   differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to   exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the   proportion of his faith; if service, in his serving; or he who   teaches, in his teaching; or he who exhorts, in his exhortation;   he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he   who shows mercy, with cheerfulness." Spiritual gifts are differing   forms of grace given to the church for the building up of the body   for the obedience of faith for the sake of the Name.        As Each One Has Received a Gift, Employ it        Peter put it like this in 1 Peter 4:10, "As each one has   received a gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards   of the manifold grace of God." The grace of God comes to the   church in manifold forms and ways - as many forms as there are   people. And the use of that grace to bring about the obedience of   faith is what spiritual gifts are.        So it isn't surprising that at the very beginning of this   greatest of all letters - this great theological masterpiece -   Paul would call us to think and pray about spiritual gifts and how   all of us are debtors to the wise and to the foolish because of   God's grace, not just outside the church toward unbelievers, but   inside the church to each other. "Owe nothing to anyone except to   love one another" (Romans 13 :8).        So here is the sum of the matter: grace came to us absolutely   free and unconditional from God when he called us to himself and   loved us as his own (1:6-7). This grace makes us debtors to   everyone who, like us, needs grace, because not to share the grace   we received would imply that we qualified for it and they don't;   and that would nullify grace. And what we share is the gospel of   this great free grace. This is how we pay our debt to others:   freely we received, freely we give. And one of the ways we share   the good news of God's grace is through spiritual gifts. O, how   important is the body life of the church in small groups where   people understand that every member is a steward of grace to bring   about the obedience of faith for the sake of the Name.
