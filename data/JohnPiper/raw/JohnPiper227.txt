        RESCUING UNBORN CHILDREN:    REQUIRED AND RIGHT        Proverbs 24:10-12        If you faint in the day of adversity,    your strength is small.    Rescue those who are being taken away to death;    hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.    If you say, "Behold, we did not know this,"    does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?    Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it,    and will he not requite man according to his work?            Introduction        I want to begin with a word to women who have had abortions and   to the fathers who may have agreed to it, and to the grandmothers   and grandfathers who may have demanded it. This will be a painful   message but it is not a hopeless one.        Alongside the death of 20 million unborn humans stands the   tragedy of over 10 million women enduring abortions and dealing   with that loss. In the first ten months of its existence the   organization called Women Exploited By Abortion grew from two   women to 10,000 members who had had abortions but were now   strongly pro-life. (Cited in Abortion, by Paul Fowler, Multnomah,   1987, p. 172).        In 1981 the regional director of Suicides Anonymous testified   to the Cincinnati City Council like this: "This Cincinnati group   has seen 5,620 members in 35 months. Over 4,000 were women of whom   1,800 or more had had abortions. The highest suicide rate is in   the 15 to 24 age group. There is a direct linkage between suicide   attempts and &#91;abortion&#93;." (Quoted in Abortion, by Paul   Fowler, p. 195)        The reason for this is the depth and variety of the ongoing   emotional effects of abortion. These may include discomfort with   children, feeling victimized, feelings of self-hate, guilt, anger,   depression, grief, regret, loss, preoccupation with aborted child,   frequent crying, etc.        But here's the key word of hope. I spoke with one young woman   in our church recently who had had an abortion and this is what   she wanted me to stress. No one is cut off from Christ because of   past sin &#151; any past sin. What cuts a person off from Christ   and the fellowship of his people is the endorsement of past sin.   For the repentant there is forgiveness and cleansing and hope.        Beverly Smith McMillan opened the first abortion clinic in   Jackson Mississippi. After a life-changing conversion to Christ   she resigned. She confessed, "The good news that makes the Gospel   so relevant today is that God forgives. I know from personal   experience that the blood of Jesus can cover the sin of abortion."   (Fowler, Abortion, p. 198) There are an increasing number of   post-abortion support groups that help women discover and enjoy   this forgiveness and healing.        One of the ironies in this whole affair is that women who have   been though abortion can be one of the most powerful forces for   life in our culture. And yet almost everything in the pro-life   movement brings back such painful memories that it is hard to be   involved. So I would just say, there is forgiveness, there is   cleansing, there is healing, there is hope, and when you are   ready, there is a great work to be done, and we await your   help.        
        Exposition        We begin now with a look at Proverbs 24:11:        Rescue those who are being taken away to death;    hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.        Nothing is said in the verse about the situation in mind. Is it   captives taken in war about to be destroyed. Is it victims of   vigilante justice? Is it an innocent person wrongly accused in   court? Is it murder in the streets? Is it child-sacrifice to pagan   gods? The text does not say what the situation is.        This is typical of Biblical proverbs. They are often very   general guidelines for how the fear of God works itself out in day   to day life. God expects us to have enough spiritual wisdom and   enough experience from life and enough awareness of his Word to   apply these proverbs appropriately.        Verse 11 is a general statement. And the reason it's general is   so that we will not limit it to one group of humans and try to   leave out another group. We must not limit it to Jews or white   people or healthy people or rich people or intelligent people. It   is general, not specific.        What then does it teach us to do? The duty of verse 11 could be   stated like this: "If a group of humans is being taken away to   death who ought not be taken away to death, the people who fear   God ought to try to rescue them." Or, to use the words of the   second half of the verse, "If there is a group of humans who are   stumbling (literally: slipping) to the slaughter who ought not to   be slipping to the slaughter, the people who fear God ought to try   to hold them back from the slaughter." What is being commanded   here is some kind of intervention from us when we become aware of   humans being killed who ought not to be killed.        Then verse 12 anticipates an objection that some people will   raise who didn't do anything to try to rescue those who were being   taken away to death. It says, "If you say, 'Behold, we did not   know this,' does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not   he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not requite   man according to his work?"        This means that the writer here has in mind the possibility   that the slaughter may be cloaked; it may be hidden or concealed   or secret enough that people would claim with some plausibility   that they didn't know it was going on.        But the text says the plausibility will not hold with God. In   other words the excuse of ignorance is not likely to stand up in   God's courtroom. It may stand up in man's courtroom because man   cannot weigh the heart. But God knows our motives and our   awareness exactly. He sees through all our rationalizations and   knows perfectly when we have neglected a duty out of ignorance or   out of laziness or fear or apathy or preoccupation with lesser   things. There will be no evasion with God.        Notice that the verse does not say, "You claim not to know   about the slaughter, but God knows that you do know." It says   something more radical. What it says is, "You claim not to know   about the slaughter, but God knows how your heart works." In other   words God not only knows what we really know inside. He also knows   when our ignorance is guilty ignorance.        When we are called to account for our actions he not only will   say, "Why didn't you act this way if you knew this much?" He will   also say, "Why did you allow yourself, in view of how much was at   stake, to remain in such insensitive ignorance?" And he will know   the answer before we give it, because he weighs the hearts of   everyone of us. "Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know   it?"        So our text this morning makes three things clear.        First, it makes clear that when a group of humans are being   killed who ought not to be killed, it is our Biblical duty to   intervene and to try to rescue them and to hold them back from the   slaughter.        Second, the text makes clear that sometimes slaughter can be   done with enough camouflage that people may try to make a   plausible case that they did not really know what was   happening.        Third, it makes clear that the excuse of ignorance is not   likely to hold with God who not only knows what we really know in   our hearts but also what we have willfully neglected to know.        Now I believe very strongly that this is God's word to us today   concerning the slaughter of abortion. I believe this text is a   clear call to action along with many others of a similar kind   (Psalm 82:3-4; Isaiah 58:6-7; James 1:27; 2:14-17; 1 John 3:16-17;   etc.).        But before I say more about that action I need to at least   mention in summary form why I think the unborn who are being taken   away to death are indeed a group of humans who ought not to be   killed in the abortion clinics of our city. And if the unborn are   human beings they qualify for protection under this text.        
        Are the Unborn Human Beings?        Here are some of my reasons for counting the aborted unborn as   human beings in their own right.        1. They have been conceived by two human beings, not by two   animals or a human and an animal. Therefore they are utterly   unique in the animal kingdom. Genetically they are human, not   whales or horses or apes.        2. The Bible teaches that in the womb God is knitting together   a person. Psalm 139:13 says, "Thou didst knit ME together in my   mother's womb."        3. In the Bible the unborn are referred to in personal terms.   For example, in Genesis 25:22 Rebekah's pregnancy is described   like this: "The children (the ordinary word for children or sons   outside the womb) struggled together within her." Luke 1:41 says   that "when Elizabeth (who was six months pregnant) heard the   greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb." The word for   "babe" (brephos) is the same word used in 2:12 and 2:16 for the   baby Jesus wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger (and   in 18:15 for the infants being brought to Jesus). The unborn are   not regarded impersonally in the Bible.        4. The unborn look like you and me when they are being aborted.   The science of fetology with its photography and ultrasound has   opened a window on the womb that is breathtaking. We can now look   at these little beings and let their face and eyes and nose and   ears and hands and arms and feet and legs testify that they are   one of us. There is no question any more of aborting a mass of   tissue or something like an egg yolk.        (Sheila Kitzinger's book, Being Born, gives clear pictures of   what the baby looks like at the key stages of pregnancy. Most   abortions happen after the seventh week of pregnancy. Midwest   Health Center for Women four blocks from our church doesn't even   quote prices on abortions before seven weeks. The 1987 fee   schedule was 7-12 weeks: $195; 12.1 - 13.6 weeks: $260; 14+ weeks:   $360. Much later than this they refer mothers to another facility   for the abortion. In the Twin Cities St. Paul Ramsey does late   abortions. I know of one several weeks ago of a twenty one week   old baby.)        Pictures matter. If someone asked you to look at a group of   animals and identify which was a human, you would not have any   trouble. You would do it on the basis of what it looks like. There   is a human likeness. And the unborn have it as early as most   abortions take place.        It is not only the still life photographs that make the   humanity plain but also the moving pictures of their activity and   their recoiling at pain.        5. These little beings will grow up if left alone. If we do not   intrude with violence on their life, they will come to maturity.   They are not becoming human, they are growing "into the fullness   of humanity that they already possess." (John Stott. Christianity   Today, 5 Sept. 1980, p. 50f.)        6. Being tiny does not make them less human. We know this   because we don't regard born infants as less human than adults   even though they are humorously out of proportion with their big   heads and short arms. We've just gotten used to looking at them at   that funny stage &#151; and we will get used to looking at the   unborn at their stages too when we open our eyes!        Nor does not breathing make the unborn less human. I would not   regard Noel as less human if she had to be sustained on a   respirator for a few months.        Nor does the lack of rational abilities and language make the   unborn less human. We don't hold that against a born infant and   there is no reason we should hold it against an unborn infant.        Nor does the location of the unborn inside a woman's womb make   it less human. Location is an irrelevant consideration in defining   humanity. Nor does the dependence on another for its blood   transactions make it less human &#151; not any more than a person   who lives by repeated dialysis.        In other words the things that are unusual about the life of   the unborn do not disqualify him or her from the human family.        7. Finally, the unborn are humans because more and more of them   at earlier and earlier ages can live outside the womb if cared for   adequately. I have a picture here of Kenya King, born in Orlando   Florida (four and a half months along). She weighed 18 oz. She is   shown here healthy in her mothers arms at five pounds. Alongside   this picture is a dead baby the same size as Kenya when she was   born. The dead baby was killed by abortion.        Now what is the difference between these babies? One was wanted   and the other was not. And brothers and sisters that criterion for   humanity will not be accepted in heaven! And it ought not to be   accepted on the earth. The Bible is full of statements commanding   love and protection for the unwanted.        I conclude then that the unborn are a group of humans who are   not disqualified from the command of Proverbs 24:11 and that when   the Bible says, "Rescue those who are being taken away to death;   hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter," we have no   right to put the unborn in a subhuman class that does not qualify   for our rescue. We ought to rescue as many as we can.        Rescuing and Trespassing        Finally I want to try to make the point that for some of us the   kind of rescue efforts that involve trespassing are right and   required. This is not the only way to obey Proverbs 24:11. But I   want to show that it is one right way and that conscience may well   require it of some of us.        When those of us from Bethlehem who participated in the last   rescue at Planned Parenthood were arraigned in court on January 6,   each of us was given an opportunity to address the court. Here's   what I said to Judge James Campbell.        Suppose that I lived next door to a very mean-spirited man who   was so hostile that he put up "Do not trespass" signs all over the   fence around his house mainly to keep me out. One day I hear   children screaming from his back yard. I run to the fence and   notice a little child choking on something. Instinctively I jump   the fence, knowing it says no trespassing and try to save the   child. I'm too late. After a few days this mean-spirited man seeks   a warrant for my arrest. I go into court and the judge, for   reasons beyond his control, finds me guilty of trespassing and   fines $50. Would I be disrespectful of the law, I asked Judge   James Campbell, if I refused to pay?        He answered by saying, "In that case you should appeal the   decision, because of a special legal reality called the law of   necessity. But there are distinguishing facts between that case   and this one."        So I asked if he would be willing to tell me what facts. He   paused (as if to groan in his own spirit) and said, "The Supreme   Court has ruled in Roe vs. Wade that abortion is not a crime."        Now this is very crucial. Listen carefully. Last August during   the rescues in Atlanta where hundreds of pro-life people were   being arrested, Charles Stanley, pastor of the First Baptist   Church, and his deacons published a statement (attached to this   message) denouncing the rescue tactics of Operation Rescue. They   argued that the rescuers were not getting arrested for protesting   abortion. They were getting arrested for trespassing. That, they   said, does not qualify as a Biblical instance of legitimate civil   disobedience. The trespass law is a good law. But the Bible only   condones breaking a law that 1) "requires an act which is contrary   to God's Word" or 2) "prohibits an act which is consistent with   God's Word." The trespass law, they say, does neither. So it is   not right to break it.        Now that I have stood before the judge in Ramsey County Court I   know better why that is not true. He said very plainly that I   should appeal the sentence if I were found guilty of trespassing   to save the life of a child. I would NOT be guilty because of "the   law of necessity." You are NOT GUILTY of crime or wrongdoing when   you trespass to save life. That is what the judge said. That is   what your conscience says. (See the law attached at the end of   this message.)        Then why are all these people being arrested and found guilty?   NOT really because of the trespass law. (I think this is the   mistake in the statement by First Baptist Church of Atlanta.)   Every judge in this country would ignore the trespass law when   saving life is at stake. This is not the law that is sending   hundred to jail and giving fines to thousands. The legal   foundation of the arrests and sentences of guilt is not the   trespass law. It is Roe vs. Wade.        If Roe vs. Wade had not stripped the unborn of their humanity,   it would be no crime to trespass to save them. Therefore when we   trespass to try to save them, we are not offending against the   trespass law at all. We are offending against Roe vs. Wade.        And that is Biblical, even on the criteria of First Baptist   Atlanta, because in effect Roe vs. Wade "prohibits an act which   consistent with God's Word," namely, the (legal!) protection of   children. Legal, mind you, because, as the Judge said, the "law of   necessity" overrules the law of trespass when saving life is at   stake.        A law which prohibits the legal effort to "rescue those who are   being taken to death and to hold back those who are slipping to   the slaughter" is the kind of law that Esther broke to save the   Jews (Esther 4:16), and Obadiah broke to save the prophets (1   Kings 18:4-16), and Rahab broke to save the spies (Joshua 2:3-4),   and Corrie Ten Boom broke to save the Jewish refugees, and many   Germans should have broken near the concentration camps, and which   many of us will break next Friday &#151; to bear witness to the   truth that even in free land there is a limit beyond which   government may not violate the law of God. Amen.        * * * * * * * * * *        postscript        On the Friday following the Sunday on which this message was   delivered at Bethlehem Baptist Church Pastor Piper and four other   staff and numerous members of Bethlehem were among the 130+ people   arrested trying to save babies at Planned Parenthood of Minnesota   on Ford Parkway, St. Paul. They were charged with trespassing and   will be arraigned on February 3.        When asked to leave by the police the following response was   given by the leader of the rescue. He read President Reagan's   "Personhood Proclamation" (attached) and said that the people   about to be killed in this building today are full citizens of the   United States and we cannot move willingly and let them be   destroyed.        The legal explanation for the legality of our act is given on   an attached sheet.
