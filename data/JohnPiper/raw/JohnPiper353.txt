 June 21, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       BEHOLD THE KINDNESS AND THE SEVERITY OF GOD    "The Echo and Insufficiency of Hell" Part 2    (Psalm 63)            The fear of hell is a good and useful thing. Jesus said, "Do   not fear those who kill the body and after that have no more that   they can do. But I will warn you whom to fear. Fear him who, after   he has killed has the power to cast into hell" (Luke 12:4-5). In   other words, fear the judgment of God.        Last week's text in Romans 11:20 and 22 said, "Do not become   proud but fear . . . behold the kindness and the severity of God."   Hebrews 10:31 says, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands   of the living God."        Hell is a horrible reality. It is fearful beyond expression or   imagination. Last week we saw that this awesomely terrible reality   is an echo of the glory of God. The Bible assumes that it is a   just and righteous recompense to all who sin. And for that to be   true how infinitely valuable and worthy must be the glory of God   that sin belittles and scorns! In other words the horror of hell   is an echo of the infinite worth of God's glory.        And if the death of Christ can justly deliver millions of   people from deserved eternal torment, how infinite must have been   the torment of the Son of God when he took our place.        So the justice of hell stands as a everlasting witness to the   infinite greatness of the glory of God, and the infinite greatness   of the suffering and righteous of Christ to redeem all who repent   and believe in him. Hell is an echo of the glory of God.        But today I want to stress the insufficiency of hell. Hell is   insufficient to save anybody. I mean hell cannot scare anyone into   heaven, because heaven is a place for those who love God, not for   those who just fear hell. This is what we hear in Psalm 63.         1 O God, thou art my God, I seek thee, my soul      thirsts for thee; my flesh faints for thee, as in a dry and      weary land where no water is. 2 So I have looked upon thee in      the sanctuary, beholding thy power and glory. 3 Because thy      steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise thee.               Fear of hell is no proof of love for God. Desiring to be   rescued by the life boats before you drown, does not prove that   you love the captain of the ship. James 2:5 says that God promised   the crown of life to those who love him--not fear hell, but love   God. James 2:12 says that God promised the kingdom of God to those   who love him. The pathway to heaven is the path of love to God.   Fear may show you that you are on the wrong path. It may point you   to the right one. But fear is not the path or the gate that leads   to life. It is what you should feel when you wander off the   path.        Last January during prayer week I made a remarkable discovery   in getting ready to lead us into repentance during the night of   prayer. I learned that the tears of repentance do not flow from   the fear of hell but from the joys of heaven. I learned that you   have to fall in love with the holiness of heaven before you can   weep over sins of hell. Let me take you on the path of my   discovery.        ***        I re-read some portions of David Brainerd's Diary. I recalled   that he had seen great repentance and contrition among the Indians   at several times in his preaching. On August 9, 1745 he preached   to the Indians of Crossweeksung, New Jersey and made this   observation:        There were many tears among them while I was      discoursing publicly . . . Yet some were much affected with a      few words spoken to them in a powerful manner, which caused the      persons to cry out in anguish of soul, although I spoke not a      word of terror, but on the contrary, set before them the      fullness and all-sufficiency of Christ's merits, and his      willingness to save all that come to him; and thereupon pressed      them to come without delay. 1         He had said earlier on August 6,        It was surprising to see how their hearts seemed to be      pierced with the tender and melting invitations of the Gospel,      when there was not a word of terror spoken to them. 2         Again on November 30 he preached on Luke 16:19-26 concerning   the rich man and Lazarus.        The Word made powerful impressions upon many in the      assembly, especially while I discoursed of the blessedness of      Lazarus 'in Abraham's bosom' &#91;Luke 16:22&#93;. This, I      could perceive, affected them much more than what I spoke of      the rich man's misery and torments. And thus it has been      usually with them. . . They have almost always appeared much      more affected with the comfortable than the dreadful truths of      God's Word. And that which has distressed many of them under      convictions, is that they found they wanted, and could not      obtain, the happiness of the godly. 3         What Brained is saying is that hell is insufficient. It is   insufficient to bring about what is really needed, namely, deep,   spiritual sorrow for sin--call it evangelical contrition.        The same dynamic seems to occur in Luke 5:1-10. After teaching   the crowds from a boat off land in the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus   told the fishermen to push out into the deep and let down their   nets for a catch (v. 4). Simon protested, "Master, we toiled all   night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the   nets." When the nets went down they filled with so much fish that   they started to break. Both boats were filled and started to sink   from the catch.        Peter's response was remarkable, very unlike our more modern   response to grace. Verses 8-10:         But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at      Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O      Lord."          What is remarkable here is that a miracle of grace, not a word   of judgment, broke Peter's heart and brought him to contrite,   evangelical repentance. It was the same with the Indians of   Crossweeksung and the fisherman of Galilee.        Now why is that?        Genuine evangelical contrition for sin is a sorrow for not   having holiness. But now you have to be careful here. It is   possible to weep over not having holiness NOT because you love God   and want to enjoy all that he is for you in Christ, but because   you fear the punishment that comes for not having holiness. Many a   criminal will weep when his sentence is read not because he has   come to love righteousness but because his freedom to do more   unrighteousness is being taken away. That kind of weeping is not   true evangelical repentance.        The only true sorrow for not having holiness comes from a love   for God's holiness not from a fear of the consequences of not   having it. Or a more precise way to say it is this: true remorse   over not having holiness is remorse over not enjoying God and   living by the impulse of that joy. To cry over the punishment one   is about to receive for wrongdoing is no sign of hating wrong, but   only hating pain. For crying and contrition to be real and   evangelical it must come from the brokenhearted feelings you have   for lacking a life of joy in God, not just from the fearful   feelings of being threatened with pain.        But now think what this means. This was the startling discovery   I made last January. In order to cry over not having something,   you must really want to have it. And the more you want to have it,   the more you feel distressed over not having it. This means that   true evangelical contrition, true repentance must be preceded by a   falling in love with God. To truly weep at not having God's   holiness, you must long for God's holiness. To truly weep over not   possessing it, it must be attractive to you.        So you see how strange this seems at first: God and his way of   holiness must become your joy before you can weep over not having   it. You must fall in love with a person, before estrangement   really hurts.        So hell is insufficient to produce tears of genuine repentance.   For the tears to be real they have to come from really missing   God, not just missing heaven. Brainerd found that words of winsome   attractiveness produced more brokenheartedness in the Indians than   did the words of warning. Warning has value in stirring us up to   take the glories of holiness and heaven seriously so that we come   to see them for what they are and delight in them. But it is the   delight in them that causes true grief when we fall short. No one   cries over missing what they don't want to have.        Peter saw in the miracle of Jesus a treasure of hope and joy   that was so wonderful he was overwhelmed with how out of sync his   life was with such a treasure. If this much power and this much   goodness is there in Jesus for those who trust him, then O how   different would be my life if I truly believed! How radical would   be my obedience! What abandon would I feel in my living for such a   Christ! What freedom from petty grievances and from fleeting   pleasures of sin would I enjoy!        So the discovery I made was that true remorse and contrition   and repentance flow from falling in love with all that God is for   us in Jesus. Until God is our treasure we will not grieve over our   falling short of being satisfied in him and living in a way that   shows that satisfaction.        Hell cannot produce satisfaction in God. And so it cannot   produce remorse for not having God. And so it cannot produce   gospel repentance. And so it cannot save. It is insufficient.        If we want to bring about tears of gospel repentance we have to   say things that make God and his holiness--not the comforts heaven   or the escape of hell--but God himself and all that he is for us   in Christ--look alluringly attractive. The Holy Spirit takes this   alluring portrait of God and Christ and causes people to fall in   love with God. That's called regeneration or new birth, or   effectual calling. And when a person falls in love with all that   God is for them in Christ, then the tears for sin will come. And   they will be tears of remorse that God had been missed and   spurned; and they will be tears of joy that finally there is   something infinitely satisfying to live for and not just something   to fear and to flee.        The most striking way to put this is that the pain of genuine   repentance flows from the pleasure of seeing God for who he is. As   paradoxical as it may sound, genuine grief over sin flows from   genuine joy in the glory of God.        Hell is powerless to produce this. The tears that hell can   produce are the tears of remorse and fear that the sin we love   will destroy us. The practical purpose of hell is to shock us out   of our love affair with the world and send us running to the   fountain of life. But only the taste of that fountain will give a   passion for God and break our hearts that we have loved anything   else.        So I urge you: Don't let the fear of hell be your only motive   for wanting heaven. Instead, come to the living waters of God's   love and truth and goodness and wisdom and power and justice and   grace and glory. Taste and see that the Lord is good. His   steadfast love is better than life. Let the fearful insufficiency   of hell drive you to the all-sufficiency of God.
