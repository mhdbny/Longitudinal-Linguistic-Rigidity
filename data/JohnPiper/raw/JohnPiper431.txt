    January 22, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     FASTING FOR THE SAFETY OF THE LITTLE ONES   (Ezra 8:21-23)           Then I proclaimed a fast there at theriver of Ahava, that we might    humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journeyfor us, our little ones,    and all our possessions. For I was ashamed to request from theking troops and horsemen to    protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to theking, The hand of    our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but Hispower and His anger are    against all those who forsake Him. So we fasted and soughtour God concerning this    matter, and He listened to our entreaty.             It's not my main purpose this morning torehearse all the arguments we  have given over the years in preaching and in writing for the pro-life position. There are  Biblical reasons, medical and scientific reasons, philosophicalreasons, legal reasons,  and psychological reasons. But it is remarkable to me that, asevery year goes by and this  anniversary of Roe V. Wade rolls around, new validations of pro-life arguments turn up,  because of the obviousness of the evil of abortion on demand evento the moment just  before birth.    Let me give you just one illustration. There isa debate going on about  the harvesting of organs from handicapped infants, namely, thosewho are anencephalic --  they are born with almost no brain and cannot live a normal life,but will usually die in  a matter of days or weeks. One person said, The qualify oflife for this child is so  low it would be ethically justifiable to sacrifice its life by afew days to save the life  of another person.    Now that kind of reasoning is ominous for allhandicapped people and  all aging people who are increasingly vulnerable to those whowould dictate what quality  of life makes life sacred and safe from termination. But what ismost significant for the  pro-life argument is the reasoning of the ACLU in favor of takingdonor organs (like the  heart) from anencephalic babies before they die a natural death.    For decades pro-life advocates have argued thatthere is no morally  significant difference between a baby in the womb and a babyoutside the womb during the  weeks just before and after birth. In other words it is arbitraryin the extreme, from the  standpoint of the child, to say that it is legal abortion to killa baby in the womb but  it is illegal homicide to kill a baby just after coming out of thewomb. This has been a  strong argument for respecting the unborn.    Now the ACLU has taken this argument andvirtually endorsed it, but  used it in exactly the opposite direction, namely, to justify thekilling of some babies  just after birth. The aim is to show that permitting thetermination of pregnancy up to  the point of birth is inconsistent with forbidding the terminationof an anencephalic  child's life in order to use his organs to save another.     Here's the actual wording of their argument:          There is absolutely no morallysignificant change in the fetus    between the moments immediately preceding and followingbirth.       In other words the argument that the pro-lifemovement has used for  years is conceded, but then used not to protect the unborn but toremove protection from  the newborn. If there's no difference between born and unborn, andwe permit the aborting  of the unborn, then we should permit some killing of the born incertain cases -- thus the  A.C.L.U.    Now just at this point the penetratingearnestness of fasting in the  Christian church comes into the picture. At least I would like topush it into the picture  for us. This kind of reasoning is a great evil. Taking one of themost obvious reasons for  not permitting abortion on demand and making it a justificationfor infanticide is morally  repugnant. It is another evidence that what we are up against inthe abortion industry is  a great darkness. This kind of perverse reasoning is evidence ofwhat Paul calls God's  giving people over to a dark and depraved mind (Romans1:28).     What I am suggesting this morning is thatperhaps the Christian church  has not used all the spiritual resources available to us in theeffort to overcome such  darkness. Have we sought the Lord with fasting for the restoringof reason and light, and  for the safety of the little ones? I admit that I have notseriously, during all my years  of pro-life efforts fasted specifically for the moral andspiritual renovation that this  kind of darkness demands.    Don't misunderstand. I believe in the widerange of non-violent efforts  of the pro-life cause. And in the present atmosphere I do stress non-violent . This  war will not be won by bullets. It will be won by brokenness andhumility and sacrifice.  It will be won when we identify with the children in our sufferingrather than with the  abortionist in his killing. And this too may be a call to a newkind of fasting.    I believe that education is good, and I wasthrilled with the excellent  news supplement, She's a Child Not a Choice that wasmailed to 900,000 homes  in October and November of last year. This is the kind ofeducation effort that needs to  happen again and again. The words of Jesus have broad application,You will know the  truth and the truth will make you free (John 8:32).    I believe, that political action of pro-lifepeople is good. God  ordains that governments exist for the protection of its peoplefrom violence (Romans  13:3f). For many of us this was the most remarkable and gratifyingthing about the  elections last fall. Not a single pro-life incumbent Senator,House member, or governor  anywhere in the country, whether Republican or Democrat, wasdefeated by a pro-abortion  challenger. In contrast, about 30 incumbent pro-abortion membersof Congress were defeated  by pro-lifers. A fact which I did not hear or read in the Newsmedia -- another  illustration of darkness.    Third, I believe in crisis pregnancy care. Thisis why we chose to put  CareNet's insert in the bulletin. The focus of this ministry isprevention through  compassion for women in distress (Luke 7:48-50). There arethousands of such centers and  groups around the country. The hands of Christ's people areextended, with tangible,  workable alternatives to abortion.    And fourth, I believe in sidewalk counseling.Story after story is told  of women who are given the truth at the 11th hour just beforetheir appointment, and are  persuaded to save their child and their conscience. (Check with Pro-Life Action  Ministries  (ph. 612/ 771-1500).    But at root the issue we are facing is aspiritual one -- the darkness  and depravity of the human heart and mind. What I am suggestingthis morning is that we  seriously consider the call to fasting for the safety of thelittle ones. That we seek the  Lord through fasting for the gracious, powerful, liberatingrenovation of the human spirit  that would cause a person to wake up and say:  How can Iuse the similarity  between born and unborn to argue for killing the born and notprotecting the unborn? I  will not do that anymore. And I will turn to the Lord, JesusChrist, for the forgiveness  of my sins and for new life.     The true renovation of heart looks to Jesusfor the forgiveness for  all sins and for the gift of eternal life and the power to walk ina way pleasing to God.  Might not the cry of our hearts for such an awakening ofconscience and faith be made more  full and earnest and fruitful through fasting? Is that not what weare seeing in these  days?    I got this idea from the story of Ezra in Ezra8:21-23. Let me give you  some faith-building background to this text so you hear it withall the force Ezra gives  it.     Israel had been taken into exile. They had beenthere for decades. Now  the time had come for their restoration. But how could thishappen? They were a tiny,  obscure ethnic minority in the massive Persian empire. The answeris that God rules  empires. And when it is his time for his people to move, he movesempires. That's the  point of the first eight chapters of this book of Ezra.    Look first at Ezra 1:1-2.          Now in the first year of Cyrus king ofPersia, in order to fulfill    the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, the Lord stirredup the spirit of Cyrus    king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout allhis kingdom, and also put it    in writing, saying, 2 Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'TheLord, the God of heaven,    has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointedme to build Him a house    in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.        God had prophesied by Jeremiah that the peoplewould come back to their  own land. God never leaves his prophesies uncertainly to befulfilled by the mere will of  man. He himself acts to fulfill the predictions he makes. So itsays, He stirred up  the spirit of Cyrus. So there's the answer. When God isready to do a great thing in  the world, he can do it whether it is through a Persian king or aprophet or a Christian  pro-life worker. The key is God's absolute sovereignty over theempires of the world.    Then what happens is this. A first wave ofrefugees return -- over  42,000 of them. They start building the temple. But their enemiesin Judah oppose them and  write to the new Emperor, Artaxerxes telling him that a rebelliouscity is being rebuilt  (4:12). So Artaxerxes halts the work on the temple and it lookslike God's plans are  frustrated.     But he had a different and better plan -- O letus learn that the lean  years of trouble in our lives are preparations for God's blessing!In Ezra 5:1 God sends  two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah who inspire the people to beginbuilding again. The  enemies try the same tactic. They write a letter to Darius, thenew emperor. But it  backfires and we see why God had allowed the building to ceasetemporarily.    Darius searches the archives of the empire andfinds the original  decree from Cyrus authorizing the building the temple. In Ezra 6:7-8 he writes back the  stunning news -- beyond what they could ask or think. He says tothe enemies in Judah,         Leave this work on the house of God alone;let the governor of the Jews    and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on itssite. 8 Moreover, I issue a    decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judahin the rebuilding of this    house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people fromthe royal treasury out of    the taxes of the provinces beyond the River, and that withoutdelay.       What a reversal! What a great God! It looked asthough the enemies had  triumphed. But God was simply working history in his time so thatthe enemies would not  only permit the temple but also  pay for  the temple! Ezra6:22 states the great fact  plainly: the Lord had turned the heart of the king ofAssyria toward them to  encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God ofIsrael. God rules the  hearts of kings and emperors and presidents and senators andcongressional representatives  -- even those who don't trust him..                          Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,          but trust him for his grace,          Behind a frowning providence          he hides a smiling face.                   O the lessons here for us! Do you think thecrash-and-burn year of 1994  at Bethlehem is without some great saving purpose? Not if our Godis the God of Ezra! Do  you think the election of a pro-choice president two years ago iswithout some great  purpose of righteousness bigger and more stunning than any of uscan imagine? Is our God  the God of Ezra?!    Then Ezra comes into the picture with aflashback to the reign of  Artaxerxes. The king sends Ezra with a company of people back toJerusalem. According to  Ezra 7:6 King Artaxerxes gives him everything he wants for thejourney. Now why would the  very king who stopped the building of the temple do that? Ezragives the answer in 7:27.  He prays, Blessed be the Lord, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing  as this in the king's heart . God did it.    He did it to Cyrus (1:1); he did it to Darius(6:22) and he did it to  Artaxerxes (7:27). The kings heart is like streams of waterin the hand of the Lord;  he turns it wherever he wills (Prov. 21:1). God is rulingthe world. He is ruling  history. We cannot understand the infinite wisdom of his ways(Romans 11:34-35). Ours is  to trust and joyfully obey and worship.    Which brings us to what Ezra did as he leftcaptivity on his way to  Jerusalem. He refused an army escort so that he could testify toArtaxerxes the power and  faithfulness of God in protecting his company of people. Insteadof the king's help he  sought God's help and he sought it with fasting. Ezra 8:21-23,          Then I proclaimed a  fast  there atthe river of Ahava, that    we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safejourney for us,  our    little ones  [that's where I got the idea of fasting for thesafety of the little    ones], and all our possessions. 22 For I was ashamed to requestfrom the king troops and    horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we hadsaid to the king,    The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those whoseek Him, but His power    and His anger are against all those who forsake Him. 23 Sowe fasted and sought our    God concerning this matter, and He listened to ourentreaty.        In verse 21 fasting is an expression of ourhumility -- that is our  sense of utter dependence on God for what we need. Iproclaimed a  fast  there  at the river of Ahava, that we might  humbleourselves . And believe me, we are  utterly dependent on God if darkened minds are going to beawakened to the light of life  in the battle for the sanctity of life. Reasoning has its crucialplace. But unless the  sovereign God moves on the mind and heart (like he did on Cyrusand Darius and  Artaxerxes), the very best reasoning will be taken captive andtwisted upside down, as we  saw at the beginning.    And in verse 23 fasting is an expression ofseeking God with  life-and-death seriousness. So we  fasted  and sought our God .     The result at the end of verse 23: Helistened to our  entreaty. And they and their little ones came safely home.    I appeal to you to seek the Lord with meconcerning the place of  fasting in breaking through the darkness that engulfs our stateand our nation on this  matter of abortion. May it be that the Lord is calling the churchnot only to fast in  general for a great awakening in our land, but also calling us tofast specifically for  the safety of the little ones. If you ask him, he will show youhow.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
