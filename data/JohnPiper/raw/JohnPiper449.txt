    September 10, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     TOWARD THE TITHE AND BEYOND:   How God Funds His Work     I almost designed this message as an openletter to my elder sons.  Karsten has been married for three months and lives with Shelly inBoston and Benjamin  just turned twenty and lives in Georgia and goes to a technicalschool while working as an  apprentice in a German plastics company. Both of them are on theirown and earning a  living. Which raises this question: are they tithing the moneythey earn? Or was that a  mere lifestyle option mom and dad chose -- like, say, living inthe city and shopping at  Savers? One of my deep desires for my sons is that they handletheir money in a  God-exalting, biblical way. You&#146;ll see why this matters somuch to me as their father  before we&#146;re done.    Last year  Christianity Today  carried anarticle about young  adults and financial giving. Here are several sentences that makeme concerned about  biblical finances for the wider Christian church. James Williamsof the Church of God  World Service said,          Our people 45 years old and youngerhave grown up mesmerized by    materialism. There's tremendous pressure on families to spend,spend, and spend.    Then he adds, I've heard that the generation that believedin the tradition of    tithing is in three places: retirement homes, nursing homes, orcemeteries.       In other words most baby boomers and babybusters haven&#146;t embraced  tithing.    I have written to my sons brief admonitions andencouragements over the  years. While they were at home we taught them to take a tenth ofeverything they earned  and give it to the cause of Christ. But they are gone now, and yethundreds like them come  to Bethlehem year after year. Maybe you are here in the Citiesgoing to college. Or you  are young and newly employed. You may be married and just startinga home of your own. And  the question for you, as for my sons, is: how will you handle themoney you earn?    A couple of weeks ago Ben and I talked on thephone about this issue.  He had brought it up. And it was clear that one of the hindrancesto tithing when you move  is that the church you are used to give to is back home and thereis no place yet that  feels home enough to invest all that money in. Be careful, lestthat struggle become a  drawn out pattern of non-giving. There is always a worthy Churchor Ministry or Mission to  give to.    So, as a kind of open letter to my sons, andyet for all of you too, I  want to appeal to you to tithe and go beyond the tithe in the wayyou release money out of  your hands into the cause of Christ and his kingdom. I have calledthis message:  Toward   the Tithe and Beyond because I know that many of you are notthere yet and may be  moving toward the practice of giving 10% of your grossincome to the Work of  Christ. I have called it Toward the Tithe  andBeyond  because in a  crying world like ours the more you make the less ideal becomesthe principle of 10%.  I&#146;ll come back to that in a few minutes.     Seven Biblical Reasons to Tithe     The way I would like to handle this is togive seven summary  reasons -- which I will try to show from Scripture -- for why Ipray my sons will all give  the first 10% of their income to the work of Christ, and then growbeyond that as God  prospers them.     1. Tithing honors an Old Testament principleof how God provided for  the ministers he called and the expenses of their ministry.     You recall that in the Old Testament Goddesignated one of the  twelve tribes of Israel, the tribe of Levi, to be the tribe thatwould have the ministry  of the tabernacle and the Temple. So instead of giving them aportion of the land, God  said that these vocational ministers of the tabernacle should liveoff the tithes of the  other eleven tribes. In Numbers 18:20-21 God said to Aaron,           You shall have no inheritance in theirland, nor own any portion    among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among thesons of Israel. And to the    sons of Levi, behold,  I have given all the tithe inIsrael for an inheritance ,    in return for their service which they perform, the service ofthe tent of meeting.        When we tithe today we honor a principle foundhere. Some of God&#146;s  people are called not to do money-making business in the ordinaryways. They are called to  be pastors and ministers and missionaries and ministry assistants,and so on. The rest of  God&#146;s people (call them lay ministers) are to begainfully employed and  support the vocational ministers -- and the costs ofthat ministry. In the Old  Testament God laid down that this be done by tithe.    If the question is raised whether Jesus, in theNew Testament,  continued this principle for the sake of his church, one of thestrongest arguments that  he did is Matthew 23:23 where he says,           Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,hypocrites! For you tithe mint    and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier provisionsof the law: justice and    mercy and faithfulness; but  these are the things youshould have done without    neglecting the others.          So Jesus endorses tithing: don&#146;t neglectit. It is  not  as  essential as justice love and mercy; but it is to be done.    Yet one might say that he is only talking toJews in an essentially Old  Testament setting. Maybe so. But there is another pointer that theprinciple was preserved  in the early church. In 1 Corinthians 9:13-14 Paul says,           Do you not know that those who performsacred services  (in the    temple)  eat the food of the temple, and those who attendregularly to the altar     (of sacrifice in the temple)  have their share with thealtar?        In other words he reminds the church that inthe Old Testament economy  there was this system in which the Levites who worked in theTemple lived off the tithes  brought to the temple. Then he says in verse 14:           So also the Lord directed those whoproclaim the gospel to get    their living from the gospel.        The least Paul is saying is that those whospend their lives in the  service of the Word of God should be supported by the rest of theChristians. But since he  draws attention to the way it was done in the Old Testament as themodel, it seems likely  that tithing would have been the early Christian guideline, if notmandate.     In other words when we tithe today we honor aprinciple and plan of God  that sustained the ministry in the Old Testament and probablysustained the New Testament  ministry as well.     2. When we release a tenth of our income andgive it over to the  ministry and mission of Christ in the world, we honor the Creatorrights of God who owns  everything, including all our income.     One objection to thinking of a tenth of ourincome as especially  belonging to God is that ALL our money belongs to God. Psalm 24:1,     The earth is the Lord's, and all itcontains, The world, and those  who dwell in it.     That is absolutely true. It&#146;s why my mainway of talking about  money year in and year out at Bethlehem is not to focus ontithing, but to focus on  lifestyle. What you do with every cent says something about yourview of God and what he  means to you. And what your values are in this age. And what youthink your few years on  earth should be spent for. That&#146;s true.    But God is wise and knows us deeply. He knowsthat there is something  wrong with the husband who answers his wife&#146;s complaint thathe doesn&#146;t give her  any time by saying, What do you mean, I don&#146;t give youmy time? ALL my time is  yours. I work all day long for you and the children. Thathas a very hollow ring to  it if he doesn&#146;t give her any especially time.Giving her some evenings  together and some dates does not deny that all his time is forher, it proves it. This is  why God declares one day in seven especially God&#146;s. They areall his, and making one  special proves it.    And this is the way it is with our money andGod. Giving God a tenth of  our income does not deny that all our money is God&#146;s, itproves that we believe it.  Tithing is like a constant offering of the first fruits of thewhole thing. The tenth is  yours, O, Lord, in a  special  way, because all of it isyours in an  ordinary  way.      I believe the tithe should be the first checkwe write after the income  deposit is made in the bank. And when you write it, you put a sealover what&#146;s left:  GOD&#146;S .  The tithe reminds us of that, and proves that we really believeit.     3. Giving away a tenth of our income to themission and ministry of  Christ is an antidote to covetousness.     The last of the ten commandments says:Thou shalt not  covet. Jesus said in Luke 12:15, Beware, and be onyour guard against every  form of covetousness (or greed). And in Colossians 3:5 Paulcalls covetousness  idolatry. Wanting things too much is incrediblydangerous for your soul.  Hebrews 13:5 says,     Let your character be free from the love ofmoney, being content with  what you have.    Every time you give a tithe, you must deal withthe desire for what you  might have bought for yourself. To give is not to buy. And thatweekly crisis is utterly  important to maintain. We must fight covetousness almost everyday. And God has appointed  an antidote: giving. He tests us again and again: what do wedesire most -- the  advancement of his name or 10% more security and comfort and fun?As Jesus says, You know  where your heart is by where your treasure is. Tithing is one ofGod&#146;s great  antidotes to covetousness.     4. The fourth reason is almost the same asthe last one, but not  quite. When we go to the tithe  and beyond , as I amsuggesting we should, it puts a  governor on ever-expanding spending.     There is an almost infallible human rule:spending expands to fill  the income. This is why you could have a book a few years agoentitled  Getting By on  $100,000 a Year.  If you make more you buy more, and the thingsyou buy have to be  stored and repaired and insured. spending begets spending. If youhave less at your  disposal you spend less. And most of the time you don&#146;t eventhink about it. I spend  absolutely no time thinking about world cruises and $30,000 cars.But if I made two or  three hundred thousand dollars a year, pretty soon things likethat wouldn&#146;t seem any  more strange to me than all the stuff I buy now -- because I couldafford it.    If this is true -- if expenses almostinevitably expand to fill the  income -- how shall we restrain ourselves from accumulating moreand more stuff and more  and more expensive stuff, and looking to the world like we haveall the same values they  do in our little earthly prelude to eternity? The answer is thatas our income grows we  move beyond the tithe. We resolve to give a greater and greaterpercentage of our income  to advance the kingdom. This puts the brakes on our naturalimpulse toward luxury.      Illustration: John Wesley      Take John Wesley for example. He was one ofthe great evangelists  of the 18th Century, born in 1703. In 1731 he began to limit hisexpenses so that he would  have more money to give to the poor. In the first year his incomewas 30 pounds and he  found he could live on 28 and so gave away two. In the second yearhis income doubled but  he held his expenses even, and so he had 32 pounds to give away (acomfortable year&#146;s  income). In the third year his income jumped to 90 pounds and gaveaway 62 pounds. In his  long life Wesley&#146;s income advanced to as high as 1,400 poundsin a year. But he  rarely let his expenses rise above 30 pounds. He said that heseldom had more than 100  pounds in his possession at a time.     This so baffled the English Tax Commissionersthat they investigated  him in 1776 insisting that for a man of his income he must havesilver dishes that he was  not paying excise tax on. He wrote them, I have two silverspoons at London and two  at Bristol. This is all the plate I have at present, and I shallnot buy any more while so  many round me want bread.      When he died in 1791 at the age of 87 the onlymoney mentioned in his  will was the coins to be found in his pockets and dresser. Most ofthe 30,000 pounds he  had earned in his life had been given away. He wrote,          I cannot help leaving my books behind mewhenever God calls me hence;    but in every other respect, my own hands will be my executors.         In other words, I will put a control on myspending myself, and I will  go beyond the tithe for the sake of Christ and his kingdom.(Quotes from  Mission  Frontiers , Sept./Oct., 1994, No. 9-10, pp. 23-24)    The last three reasons for moving to the titheand beyond are all found  in one text, 2 Corinthians 9:6-8. Let&#146;s read it and thenpoint out the reasons  briefly. Paul is talking about giving.          Now this  I  say, he whosows sparingly shall also    reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully shall also reapbountifully. Let each one  do     just as he has purposed in his heart; not grudgingly or undercompulsion; for God loves a    cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you,that always having all    sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for everygood deed.         5.   The fifth reason for going to thetithe and beyond in our  giving is that this is God&#146;s way of bringing about many gooddeeds for his glory.      At the end of verse 8 Paul says that whenyou sow bountifully and  cheerfully you will have an abundance for every gooddeed. The goal is good  deeds. Excess money is for good deeds. These are the things thatmake your light shine and  cause people to give glory to your Father in heaven. If you lay uptreasures on earth,  people have no reason to think your Father in heaven is glorious.You look like you love  what everyone else loves. According to Titus 2:13 Christ diedto purify for himself  a people who are zealous for good deeds. 2 Corinthians 9:8says that the aim of  material bounty is for every good deed. Verse 11 says,You will be  enriched in everything   for all liberality . Excess money is given to us  so we can show where our treasure is by giving it away.    So the fifth reason for going to the tithe andbountifully beyond is  that this is God&#146;s way of providing for many good deeds.     6. The sixth reason for pressing to thetithe and beyond is that it  is God&#146;s way of providing you, the tither, sufficient moneyfor your needs.     Giving is a way of having what you need.Giving in a regular,  disciplined, generous way -- up to and beyond the tithe -- issimply good sense in view of  the promises of God. Verse 6 says, He who sows bountifullyshall also reap  bountifully. Then Verse 8 says, God is able to makeall grace abound to you  that always having all sufficiency . . . In other words thebountiful  reaping promised in verse 6 is explained in verse 8 byGod&#146;s pledge to give a  sufficiency for us and an abundance for good deeds.    This seems to be Paul&#146;s way of expressingMalachi 3:10,           Bring the whole tithe into thestorehouse, so that there may be    food in My house, and test Me now in this, says the LORD ofhosts, if I will not open for    you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing untilit overflows.        This is an amazing challenge from God. Test me,he says. You think you  can&#146;t afford to tithe? Well test me. And what we will findwhen we test him is that  we cannot afford   not   to tithe -- and beyond! This isthe only safe way to  handle our money. Jesus once said, in Luke 6:38,           Give, and it will be given to you; goodmeasure, pressed down,    shaken together, running over, they will pour into yourlap.        This is not a guarantee of getting rich.It&#146;s a guarantee of  &#145;an abundance for every good work and sufficiency foryourself.     7. Finally, in our giving we should presstoward the tithe and  beyond because it will prove and strengthen our faith in Godpromises.     There is an absolute correlation betweenfaith in the promises of  God and peace of mind in giving away what we may think we need butdon&#146;t. Hebrews  13:5 puts it like this,           Let your character be free from the loveof money, being content    with what you have;  (why? because of a promise:)  for HeHimself has said, I    will never desert you, nor will I ever forsake you.        Every time you doubt that you can live on 90%of your income let the  glorious promise of God strengthen your faith: My God shallsupply all your needs  according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus (Phil.4:19).    So you can see why I care so much about my sonsand whether they are  remembering the rock from which they were hewn. Because whattithing boils down to is a  faith issue. Do we trust God&#146;s promises. I appeal to you, mysons. I appeal to you,  my people. Trust God. He will never fail or forsake you. He willsupply all your needs.
