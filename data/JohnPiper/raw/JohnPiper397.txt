  January 23, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       THE SEED OF THE WORD AND THE FRUIT OF LOVE    (1 Peter 1:22-25)               Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls      for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another      from the heart, for you have been born again not of seed which      is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and      abiding word of God. For, "All flesh is like grass, and all its      glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the      flower falls off, but the word of the Lord abides forever." And      this is the word which was preached toyou.         After a four-Sunday interlude we are back to this great book of   1 Peter. Our focus today is on 1:22-25. At the center of this text   is the command to "fervently love one another from the heart." The   most important thing we will see in this text is that the power to   love comes through hoping in God.       To really feel the force of this truth about hope and love, we   need to step back and get the big picture of chapter one, and then   look closely at what Peter is saying in verses 22-25.       Chapter one is overwhelmingly about hope. Verse 3 sounds the   note: "God caused us to be born again to a living hope through the   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." Being born again by   the power of God means becoming a person with living hope. I would   go so far as to say, in view of what we will see, that the essence   of the newness of the new person who comes into being at the new   birth is that the new-born person relentlessly hopes in what God   can do rather than what man can do. And what verse 3 says is that   God raised Jesus from the dead to give us that kind of hope. Death   is now no terror. The worst enemy of our future is destroyed.       In verse 4 Peter underlines the certainty and greatness of our   future by telling us that as God's newborn children we have an   inheritance with four hope-filled characteristics; it is   "imperishable," "undefiled," "unfading," and "reserved" in heaven.   The future God has laid up for us will be there. It will not   perish or spoil or fade. It is "guarded" by God.       Verse 5 strengthens our hope by telling us that not only is our   inheritance kept for us, but we are kept for our inheritance: we   are "protected by the power of God through faith." God sees to it,   with omnipotent power, that our faith does not fail.       He confirms this in verse 7 by contrasting gold which perishes   with our faith which does not. If gold is refined by fire even   though it's perishable, how much more will something as valuable   as your faith be refined by suffering -- but it is not perishable.   That's the note of hope. It will redound to praise and glory and   honor at the coming of Christ.       Verse 9 presses for more hope by telling us again (like v. 5)   that the outcome of our faith will be the salvation of our souls.   We will not perish. We will be saved, for ever.       Then verses 10-12 are meant to increase our anticipation for   this future by telling us that the great prophets of old wanted to   see the hope-filled truth we see and couldn't see it, and even   angels love to look into the gospel of our salvation.       Then, after 12 verses of exultation in what God has done to   give us hope, Peter gives us four commands in the rest of this   chapter. The first one is in verse 13, "Fix your hope completely   on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus   Christ." In other words, you have seen all these reasons to hope;   therefore HOPE! And hope fully! Hope in the grace of God.       The second command comes in verse 15, "Like the One who called   you, be holy yourselves in all your behavior." The first command   is "Be hopeful in God." And the second command is "Be holy like   God." If you really hope in God, you can't be indifferent to   whether you love what God loves -- that is, become holy as he is   holy (cf. 1 Thes. 3:12f).       The third command is a jarring one. But it really is rooted in   hope. Verse 17b: "Conduct yourselves in fear during the time of   your stay on earth." Fear? How does that relate to hope? But look   at the basis of this fear in verse 18: conduct yourselves in fear,   "knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like   silver or gold"...but (as v. 19 says) with the precious blood of   Christ. Odd logic: Fear! because the ransom paid to rescue you is   not perishable. It's the permanent and precious blood of Christ.   The point is this: don't treat the ransom paid for your soul with   contempt. It's a fearful thing to treat the blood-ransom of God   with contempt. That is, it is fearful to act as if the future God   is making for us is not sure and satisfying. It's a fearful thing   not to hope in God. So as odd as it sounds, the point of the third   command is: fear not hoping in God.       Finally, we come to the fourth command in today's text, verse   22b: "Fervently love one another from the heart." What I said at   the beginning is that the most important thing we will see in this   text is that the power to love comes through hoping in God. And   what we have seen is that virtually everything in chapter one   relates to hope. Peter is exulting in all that God has done and is   doing to make the future of his people infinitely and infallibly   happy. And he is describing how people live who are captured by   this truth and really believe it.       So its not surprising then that this fourth command -- to love   each other -- is sandwiched between two reasons to love that are   both descriptions of the birth of hope. Love is encased in hope.   It gets its life from hope. If we are not a hope-filled people, we   will not be a loving people.       Let's see this together now in verses 22-25.       Notice that there is a reason to love given in front of the   command to love (v. 22a) and there is a reason to love given   behind the command to love (v. 23). Let's make sure we see this   clearly. Verse 22a: "Since you have in obedience to the truth   purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren" -- there's   reason number one. You've purified your souls by obeying the truth   . . . THEREFORE (v. 22b) "fervently love one another from the   heart."       Then comes the second reason to love. "Love one another from   the heart . . . FOR (v. 23) you have been born again not of seed   which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living   and abiding word of God." Love one another because you've been   born again by the Word of God.       So the command to love stands between two reasons to love.   Picture it like a lamp in the window of the church. Supporting the   lamp are two large pillars so that it doesn't fall and break and   so that it is high enough for the world can see it. The lamp is   the love of Christians for each other. ("Let your light so shine   that men may see your good deeds.") There are two pillars holding   up the lamp. One pillar is obedience to truth which purifies the   soul (v. 22a) -- soul-purifying obedience to the truth. The other   pillar holding up the lamp of love is verse 23, new birth by the   word of God.       So if there is going to be love among us at Bethlehem (or in   any church) these two things have to be our experience: we have to   be born again by the Word of God, and our hearts have to be   purified by obedience to the truth.       You should be asking right now, Where is the hope you said was   so important in this text? You said that the power to love comes   through hoping in God. Where do you see this?       Let's take the second pillar first, and see what it really   means to be born again by the living and abiding Word of God. Look   at what Peter really emphasizes in verses 23-25. He doesn't just   emphasize new birth by the Word. He emphasizes something specific   about that Word. And he really draws it out, even with a   supporting Old Testament quote (Isaiah 40:6-8). What is it about   the Word that he emphasizes?       Verse 23: "For you have been born again not of seed which is   perishable but imperishable." Peter loves this truth: Our   inheritance is not perishable (v. 4); our faith is not perishable   (v. 7); our ransom is not perishable (v. 18,19); God's Word is not   perishable (v. 23). What's the point? The point is: it lasts. It   will not be proved wrong. It will stand as long as God stands. And   those who stand on it will not fall -- ever. The point is hope!       Keep reading in verse 23. Peter defines the imperishable seed   as "the living and abiding word of God" (or makes the Word the   instrument of the seed). So there's the point again. It is not   only imperishable, it is living and abiding. That is, it lasts. It   will not fail you. If this seed -- this Word -- has brought you   into being by the new birth, you will stay in being. Again the   point is hope.       Keep reading. He is going to say it again with Old Testament   authority. Verse 24:        "For, 'All flesh is like grass, and allits glory like      the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls      off, 25 but the word of the Lord abides forever.' And this is      the word which was preached to you."         That is as plain as he can make it. The Word of God that he is   talking about is the gospel that has been preached to them -- the   good news that we have been reading about in this chapter -- the   ransom of the blood of Christ (vv. 18-19) and the resurrection of   Christ (vv. 3,21), and the keeping power of God (v. 5) and the   inheritance of God. All this good news was preached to them. And   the point now in verse 25 is that it is not like grass and   flowers: it doesn't wither and fall, it abides forever. If this   word is your life you live forever. The point is hope.       So here's the pillar holding up the lamp of love in the church   -- fervently love one another from the heart, for you have been   born again by a seed, a Word, that is imperishable, that is living   and abiding, and that is not like grass but abides for ever.       But what's the point of making such a big deal out of the   Word's permanence? The point is that when you are born by   someone's seed, you take on the character of that seed. It   constitutes your nature. And what Peter wants us to see is that   the seed that created us, that caused us to be born again was the   Word of God that is imperishable, living, abiding, and lasting   forever. And therefore that is who we are. We are forever. And   what is it to believe this? It is hope.       Which means that the pillar which holds up the lamp of love is   the Word-created, born-again heart of HOPE. A hope that is set   free from all the grass and flowers of the world. One thing that   keeps us from loving is the fear that if we pay the price of love,   we will lose out on the bright things that life in this world is   supposed to offer us. "All its glory like the flower of grass" (v.   24).       If we endure wrong meekly;    if we renounce boasting and calling attention to ourselves;    if we spend time and energy supplying the needs of others without   fretting over our own;    if we risk making necessary reproofs that are almost surely to be   interpreted as something other than love;    if we receive reproofs without animosity and defensiveness;    if we cover a multitude of sins and put away our list of   grievances;    if we rejoice when others prosper while we don't;    if we bless those who curse us and do good to those who despise us   . . .       if we "love each other earnestly from the heart" it will be   costly and the price will be that we lose some of the cherished   glory of the grass and flowers that people in this world live for.   The power to overcome this fear is the power of HOPE -- that the   glory of this world is passing away and we who are born again   through the Word of God, and hope in the Word of God, will endure   for ever.       Just a brief look at the other pillar holding up the lamp of   love. Verse 22: "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified   your souls for a sincere love of the brethren," (that's the pillar   -- soul-purifying obedience to the truth) therefore, fervently   love one another from the heart (that's the lamp).       The truth in view here is the Word of God the gospel of verse   23 -- all the hope producing truth that we have been looking at in   this letter. Obedience to this truth is faith. What the gospel   demands is faith. Therefore faith is obedience to the gospel.   Peter confirms this in Acts 15:9 where he says that God "cleansed   &#91;the gentiles'&#93; hearts by faith" (cf. 1 Pet. 3:1; 4:17).   Here it's obedience to the truth that cleanses; there it's faith   that cleanses. Therefore, obedience to the truth is probably   faith. But faith is inseparable from hope. But if you have faith   that the word of God will abide for ever, you are hoping in the   word as well as believing in the word.       Therefore the pillar of verse 22a that holds up the lamp of   love is soul-purifying hope in the word of God. And what is the   dirt that this hope cleans out of the heart? The answer is that   hoping in God cleans out hoping in the glory of grass and flowers.   Hoping in God cleanses out the futile, empty hopes of the flesh.   It convinces us that if we live for the bright flowers of money   and comfort and fame and sex and leisure we will wither and die.   And when this new hope cleanses out these old, futile hopes, and   banks on the imperishable, living, abiding, eternal promise of   God, then and only then can we love one another earnestly from the   heart.       So the picture is complete: the lamp of love is held up and   made possible by two pillars. One pillar is God's sovereign act --   his causing us to be born again through the living and abiding   Word of God. The other pillar is our response to that divine act:   as new-born children of God we hear the Word of our Father and   obey by putting our hope in him. And when we hope in him -- that   the future he plans for us is greater than all the glory the world   can offer -- then our hearts will be clean, and we will be free to   love each other earnestly from the heart.
