       Fear Not, I Am With You, I Am Your God    (Isaiah 41:1-13)        "Coastlands, listen to Me in silence, And let the      peoples gain new strength; Let them come forward, then let them      speak; Let us come together for judgment. Who has aroused one      from the east Whom He calls in righteousness to His feet? He      delivers up nations before him, And subdues kings. He makes      them like dust with his sword, As the wind-driven chaff with      his bow. He pursues them, passing on in safety, By a way he had      not been traversing with his feet. Who has performed and      accomplished it, Calling forth the generations from the      beginning? 'I, the Lord, am the first, and with the last. I am      He.'" The coastlands have seen and are afraid; The ends of the      earth tremble; They have drawn near and have come. Each one      helps his neighbor, And says to his brother, "Be strong!" So      the craftsman encourages the smelter, And he who smooths metal      with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil, Saying of      the soldering, "It is good"; And he fastens it with nails, That      it should not totter. "But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom      I have chosen, Descendant of Abraham My friend, You whom I have      taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its remotest      parts, And said to you,' You are My servant, I have chosen you      and not rejected you. 'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not      anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen      you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My      righteous right hand.' Behold, all those who are angered at you      will be shamed and dishonored; Those who contend with you will      be as nothing, and will perish. You will seek those who quarrel      with you, but will not find them, Those who war with you will      be as nothing, and non-existent. For I am the Lord your God,      who upholds your right hand, Who says to you, 'Do not fear, I      will help you.'"         
       I bring this series on courage to a close with the text that   has served to relieve my fears more often than any other text in   the Bible--namely, Isaiah 41:10. I've told you the story before.   But since it's Father's Day I will tell you again, as a kind of   tribute to my father--and my heavenly Father.       On July 27, 1971 Noel and I boarded a 707 to fly from New   York to Munich, Germany. We believed God opened the door for us to   go study at the University of Munich. I was 25 years old, had just   graduated from Fuller Seminary the month before. God had turned my   life around in seminary so that I was eager for studies not for   their own sake but for Christ and his church.       I had written in my journal on July 12,       My desire is to throw myself into the church and be      employed by the Lord to do what he would in this day and      through me. I am not alienated from her. I am in love with her.      I want to teach in her and be taught in her. I want to be a      channel of life for her and receive life through her. I want      now to be about my studies in preparation, and I thank God for      these times at home to see some needs--in the church and in      myself. My how imperfect and weak I feel at home because I am      not as loving as I ought to be. I am a long way off from      holiness realized.        Now with that sense of desire to serve the church and that   sense of weakness and imperfection I was in New York, 15 days   later, ready to leave for Munich for three years. My father   couldn't be there to see us off because he was doing the work of   an evangelist in another state. My mother and grandmother were   there. To give a sense of realism here, let me read from my   journal entry two days later.       We picked up mother and MaMohn and headed for New      York. At about 2 PM we found Cargo Hanger 67 at Kennedy Airport      where we unloaded our 400 pounds of extra luggage and paid $253      to have it shipped on our own flight. Then we went into      Manhattan to see the town, and decided it would be preferable      to sit in Radio City Music Hall than fight that crazy traffic      and heat. From Radio City we called Daddy long distance to say      good-bye. I felt so frustrated to make our good-bye      appropriate. I came closer to crying there than when I left      Mother and mamohn at Pan Am. He gave me 3 passages to read: Is.      41:10 &#91;today's text&#93;; Is. 50:7; II Tim. 4:1-5. Noel      and I read these together before going to bed tonight. My how I      love Daddy. I think every time I am thrown into a new situation      where I may be afraid or alone my mind turns to the kind of      life daddy has been called to live for almost 30 years. I love      him for following through in that call. Oh how I pray that I      will have the faith and confidence he has in our Lord for      trying times.        For three years in Germany, Isaiah 41:10 was on my lips and in   my heart during 
 anxious times more than any other verse. In   fact it became so instinctive to say it, that today when my mind   is neutral the spinning of the gears is in Isaiah 41:10. I can   remember riding my old fashioned, second hand, balloon-tire bike   on the bumpy, cobblestone back streets of Munich along the Isar   River on the way to a class where I might have to use my German in   front of the other students, and saying over and over again to   myself, "Fuerchte dich nicht, denn ich bin mit dir; shau dich   nicht aenchstlich um, ich bin ja dein Gott. Ich staerke dich, ich   helfe dir, ich stuetze dich mit der rechten hand meiner   Gerechtigkeit." And seeing God again and again and again come   through for me.       And now I am a father with sons. And I rejoice that I can do   for them what my father did for me. So last Wednesday evening just   before Benjamin left for boot camp in Fort Jackson, South Carolina   we all sat down in the living room and I said, "There is a special   verse I want to send with you, because my father sent it with me.   It served me well and it will serve you well. "Fear not for I am   with you. Be not dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen   you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right   hand."       When I sought for a concluding text for this series on courage   and fearlessness and risk-taking it had to be the one that God has   used in my life more than any other to help me through times of   stress and fear.       Let's look at the verse, Isaiah 41:10, and then see how the   preceding verses intensify the point of the verse.       There are two commands in the verse not to fear and five   pillars of fearlessness. "Fear not" is the first command at the   beginning of the verse. And then the second is "do not anxiously   look about you" (RSV: "do not be dismayed").       As always in the Bible, there are reasons for the commands.   Commands don't hang in the air with no basis in reality. If God   commands us to do something there are good reasons to do it. And   power comes from understanding and believing those reasons.       Here there are the five reasons--call them        The Five Pillars of Fearlessness.               "For I am with you"--"Do not fear, for I am with you."                     "I am your God"--"Do not look anxiously about you, for I am      your God."                     "I will strengthen you."                     "surely I will help you."                     "Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right      hand."             Restated, the Five pillars of fearlessness are:                  God is with me;              God is my God;              God will strengthen me;              God will help me;              God will uphold me.            When God calls you to be free from fear as you do evangelism,   as you take a test, as you face an interview, as you take a stand   against an unjust business practice, as you confront someone with   sin in their life, when you leave a secure position and take a   risk in a new venture, when you face an operation or a treatment,   when you lose a spouse or a friend--when God calls you to be free   from fear (to overcome this natural emotion and have peace, he   does not leave the command hanging in the air. He puts pillars   under it. Five of them. That's the nature of all Biblical   commands. They come with divine support.       Fear not . . . God is with you;       Fear not . . . God is your God;       Fear not . . . God will strengthen you;       Fear not . . . God will help you;       Fear not . . . God will uphold you.        The key to overcoming fear is resting on the pillars of   the promises of God.         We'll come back to these pillars in a moment. Look with me for   a minute at the verses leading up to verse 10 to see how they   intensify these promises and strengthen these pillars.       If the key to fearlessness is believing that God is your God   and is with you and will strengthen you and help you and uphold   you, then knowing the greatness of this God will intensify your   faith and your fearlessness.       So look at the         Glimpses of God's Greatness that Isaiah gives.         Glimpse #1 . In Isaiah 41:1 God says,   "Coastlands, listen to Me in silence, and let the peoples gain new   strength; let them come forward, then let them speak; let us come   together for judgment."       Here is a picture of God calling all the coastlands and all the   peoples to gird up their strength and come before him for   judgment. The God of Isaiah 41:10 is the judge of all the earth.   He calls all nations to give an account of their lives and their   religions and their thoughts. He is not called to account. He is   not on trial. They are. They come into his courtroom. He is the   judge of all and will pass sentence on every person. That's the   God who is with you to strengthen and help.        Glimpse #2 . In Isaiah 41:2-3 Isaiah asks, "Who   has aroused one from the east &#91;probably Cyrus the Persian king   that God stirred up to come against Babylon&#93; whom He   &#91;God&#93; calls in righteousness to His feet? He delivers up   nations before him, and subdues kings. He makes them like dust   with his sword, as the wind-driven chaff with his bow."       Here is a picture of God rousing a king and leading him in   conquest and delivering up nations before him. So the God of   Isaiah 41:10 is Ruler of the rulers of history. He controls the   affairs of men and nations for his purposes. That's who gives the   pillars for fearlessness in Isaiah 41:10.        Glimpse #3 . In Isaiah 41:4 Isaiah asks, "Who   has performed and accomplished it, calling forth the generations   from the beginning? 'I, the Lord, am the first, and with the last.   I am He.'"       Here is a picture of God not only judging the nations and   ruling the rulers of the earth but calling all the nations of the   earth into being--"calling forth the generations from the   beginning." God is the first--he is the absolute reality before   all other reality and on which all other reality depends. He is   the uncreated first. And he will be there with the last when all   is accomplished according to his eternal purpose.       When God answers, "I, the Lord, am the first . . ." the word   "Lord" is "Jehovah or Yahweh. Franz Deilitzsch comments on this   verse: "It is the full meaning of the name Jehovah which is   unfolded here; for God is called Jehovah as the absolute I, the   absolutely free Being, pervading all history, and yet above all   history, as He who is Lord of His own absolute being, in revealing   which He is purely self-determined; in a word, as the   unconditionally free and unchangeably eternal personality" (cited   in E.J. Young, The Book of Isaiah, vol. 3, p 76). That's the God   of Isaiah 41:10 who strengthens and helps and upholds.        Glimpse #4 . In verses 5-7 Isaiah shows us the   desperate attempts of the nations to persuade themselves that they   and their gods are strong. Verse 5: they are afraid and they come   together. Verse 6: they try to encourage each other not to be   afraid, and say, "Be strong!" Verse 7: the idol makers who smooth   the metal and nail up the idols with nails try to encourage each   other and say, "It is good."       In other words, there is a picture of the unrepentant nations   desperately trying to convince themselves that their self-wrought   gods, made with soldering and nails, are really adequate for their   needs.       Over against this desperation of self-reliance and idolatry God   says to his people in verses 8-9, "But you &#91;are&#93; Israel,   My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham My   friend, you whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and   called from its remotest parts, and said to you, 'You are My   servant, I have chosen you and not rejected you.'"       In verses 1-9 there is a picture of the God who judges the   nations, and rules the rulers of the nations, and calls the   nations into being, choosing his people for himself, calling them   from their hopeless distance from him, and taking them to be his   servant.       That is what God has done for us in Christ. He chose us before   the foundation of the world. He called us out of darkness and   death. And he took us for himself to be his. To make himself our   God.       Now all that, I say, intensifies the five pillars of   fearlessness in Isaiah 41:10.       The God who judges all the earth and calls the coastlands to   give account . . .       The God who rules the rulers of history . . .       The God who calls the nations of earth into being because he is   first and last . . .       The God who calls his own people and makes himself their God   freely and graciously . . .       That God says to us who believe       I am your God.       I am with you.       I will strength you.       I will help you.       I will uphold you.        Then comes the command--on these pillars.        Therefore--because I am the judge of the nations . . .       Therefore--because I rule the rulers of history . . .       Therefore--because I call nations into being . . .       Therefore--because I choose freely my own . . .       
       Therefore--because I--this great and sovereign God--       am your God and       am with you and       will strengthen you and       will help you and       will uphold you . . .       Therefore, do not fear.        Or change the image for a moment. Not five pillars. But   God in five relations to you expressed in five different   prepositions.        I am your God--over you.       I am with you--by your side.       I will strengthen you--from inside of you.       I will help you--all around you from wherever the enemy comes.       I will uphold you--from underneath you.       Over you, by you, inside you, around you, underneath you.        Therefore do not fear.        We come to the end of this series with one great ground for   fearlessness--GOD!       I - am your God.       I - am with you.       I - will strengthen you.       I - will help you.       I - will uphold you.       I call you this morning to stop defining and limiting your   future in terms of your past and start defining it in terms of   your God.       I call you to recognize that God is greater than your   personality. God is greater than your past experiences of   timidity. God is greater than your "family of origin". And God   calls you to joyful fearlessness.       The crucial factor in your fearless living is not your family   but your God.       "Let not your hearts be troubled, BELIEVE IN GOD." Believe in   God! Trust God! Let God be your God! Your help. Your strength. He   will uphold you with his righteous right hand.       Copyright 1993 John Piper     Piper's Notes
