 April 16, 1989    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor        THE GUILT OF GIVING PART OF GOD'S COUNSEL    (Acts 20:26-27)            In verses 18-21 of this chapter Paul looks back over the three   years he spent working in Ephesus and he reminds the elders how he   served the Lord with lowliness and tears and trials and how he   testified about repentance toward God and faith in Jesus   Christ.        Then in verses 22-25 Paul shifts and looks forward to his   future which God says will include suffering and prison. And he   says that all that really matters to him, as far as his own life   is concerned, is not that he stay alive but that he finish what   God has called him to do.        Now before he gives them any direct commands or warnings in   verses 28ff (next week). He pauses once more in verses 26-27 to   say something very solemn. In a sense it's another look back to   the faithfulness of his ministry among them. And on the basis of   that past faithfulness he says something extremely serious about   his present relationship to the elders.        26) Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent (or:   clean) of the blood of all of you, 27) for I did not shrink from   declaring to you the whole counsel of God.        And then, finally in verse 28 begins his exhortation and   warning to the elders.        This is remarkable isn't it? He's more than half way through   his message before he finally, in verse 28, tells the elders to do   something or believe something. More than half of this final   message to the elders is biography -- autobiography!        Let me insert a parenthesis here about preaching and teaching.   I love the preaching and the theology of Jonathan Edwards (who   lived 250 years ago). But you can read the 1200 sermons of Edwards   that are stored at the Beinicke Library at Yale University today   and find almost no references to Edwards' own personal life. He   was so jealous of the centrality of God that he wanted to keep   himself out of the message. That's one of the reasons I love him   and go back to him rather than reading much of the   experience-oriented stuff written today.        But I think Edwards made a mistake. I think he over did it. If   Paul's preaching is a pointer to how we ought to preach and teach,   the fact is, there ought to be a significant personal dimension to   preaching and teaching. Different situations and themes call for   different proportions of personal references. But the Biblical way   seems to be that the "testimony dimension" of teaching and   preaching is not only permitted but essential.        Over half of Paul's message is a testimony about God's work in   his own life. I don't think this means that every message must be   50% autobiography (there are other sermons in Acts that are not).   But surely it means that the personal life of the preacher or   teacher cannot be separated from his preaching or teaching. This   is why teachers in the church should be godly people, as well as   good explainers and story tellers and information givers.        And isn't there an implication too for how you share the   gospel? If it's important for Paul to lay open his life before   people who already know him well, how much more important might it   be when sharing the gospel that we let people see who we really   are, and what difference Christ has made in our lives.        Close parenthesis. Paul is not rambling on aimlessly about   himself. He is building his heart and his life into the elders.   And he is trying to help them see the vindication of his message   in his own life of service. And that life is just as important as   the doctrine he teaches.        So today we look at it one more time before we turn to verse 28   next week. Specifically we look today at verses 26 and 27. Paul   wants to remind them of one more thing.        Verse 26: "Therefore I testify to you this day that I am   innocent of the blood of all of you."        Three observations about what this means and why Paul said   it.        1. "Blood" here stands for being lost eternally. In other words   he is saying that I am innocent if any of you loses eternal   life.        In some contexts blood might stand for physical death (e.g.   Acts 5:38), but that would make no sense here because Paul's   innocence is based on his teaching them the whole counsel of God.   It doesn't make sense to say, I am not responsible if you get   killed, because I have taught you the whole counsel of God. In   fact, he might get killed precisely because he taught them the   whole counsel of God.        You can see what blood really refers to when you look at a   couple parallel texts in Acts. For example Acts 18:6 describes   Paul's rejection by the Jewish community in Corinth: "And when   they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said   to them, 'Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent. From now   on I will go to the Gentiles.'"        So in this case Paul is innocent not because he had shared the   whole counsel of God, but because they wouldn't let him share it.   They wouldn't hear it. So their blood is on their own heads.        The very same thing happened back in Acts 13:46 when Paul   preached in Antioch of Pisidia. The Jewish community reviled Paul   and Barnabas and refused to hear the message any further. So verse   46 says, "Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly saying, 'It was   necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you.   Since you thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of   eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.'        So we have two parallel texts in Acts: in 18:6 the Jews reject   Paul's message and he says, Your blood be on your own heads. In   13:46 the Jews reject Paul's message and he says, You judge   yourselves unworthy of eternal life.        So I conclude that when your blood is on your own head you   forfeit eternal life, and it's your own fault. So here in Acts   20:26, when Paul says, "I am innocent of the blood of all of you,"   he means, "If any of you loses eternal life, it will not be my   fault. It will be your own." What's at stake in this verse -- and   particularly in the word "blood" -- is eternal life and eternal   lostness.        2. The second thing to notice from verse 26 is that it is   possible for us to be guilty of another person's final   lostness.        If this weren't the case Paul's statement would be pointless,   wouldn't it. He protests that he is not guilty of the blood of   anyone among them. This means that it's possible that he might   have been guilty of someone's blood. He might have been guilty for   someone's not being saved. It is possible for us to be guilty of   another person's final lostness.        Two questions come to mind immediately if this is true: 1)   Under what conditions would I be responsible for another person's   not gaining eternal life? 2) What would happen to me if I am   guilty of another person's blood?        1) I think the answer to the first question is that we are   guilty of another person's blood if we do not tell them what they   need to know even though the Spirit urges us (or the Scripture   commands us) to do so. For example, back in Acts 16:6 Luke   describes Paul's second missionary journey like this: "And they   went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been   forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia."        Now, Asia is where Ephesus is. So on that missionary journey it   was not the will of the Spirit for Paul to speak the word in   Ephesus, even though they were not yet evangelized. I conclude   that Paul would not have their blood on his head if any of them   died without Christ at this time. Why? Because the Spirit was   using Paul elsewhere and had not told him to go to Ephesus.        No one of us is responsible for every city or neighborhood or   people group. God leads people in different ways. So my conclusion   is that when he leads you -- urges you -- to tell a person what   they need to know in order to be saved, then their blood is on   your head if you go on neglecting to do it.        2) Now what does that mean? What happens to me if I have   someone's blood on my head? We are not told here (see Ezekiel   33:6-9). But I think the language is serious enough to cause some   deep soul-searching about our personal witness. In principle I   would answer like this: Jesus Christ can cleanse us from all sin   (1 John 1:9), even the sin of having another's blood on our own   head -- which of us doesn't! -- but (as with other sins) if we go   on hardening ourselves time after time to the voice of the Spirit   (or to the command of Scripture), we may prove sooner or later   that the Spirit of Christ is not really in us after all and we do   not belong to him (Romans 5:9), and therefore his blood does not   cleanse us from all unrighteousness and the lostness of all those   we neglected will compound our own ruin and destruction.        That's the second thing to see in verse 26: it is possible for   us to be guilty of another person's final loss of eternal   life.        3. The third thing to see is that it is possible to be innocent   of another person's loss of eternal life. Paul said, "I am   innocent of the blood of all of you."        Under what circumstances can we say that? Specifically, under   what circumstances can an elder -- a teaching elder like me -- at   Bethlehem say that? There are different levels of responsibility   in the church in this regard. That's why James 3:1 says, "Let not   many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we   will receive the greater judgment." God will hold you accountable   for the souls in this church up to a point -- that you pray for   them, that you exhort those you know, that you encourage, etc. But   he will hold me more accountable (Hebrews 13:17). What must I do   to be able to say with Paul when my work at Bethlehem is done, "I   am innocent of the blood of all of you"?        Of all the things Paul could have said about his ministry at   this point (his patience, his faith, his love, etc.), the one   thing he chose to say in verse 27 is this: "For I did not shrink   from declaring to you the whole counsel of God." This is the   answer: what I must do (along with the other teachers at   Bethlehem) in order to be innocent of the blood of all of you is   to declare the whole counsel of God.        I see three unmistakable implications from this verse:        1. Knowing the whole counsel of God helps people get to   heaven.        Look carefully at this and you'll see why I say it like that.   You cannot say from verse 27 that a person has to know the whole   counsel of God in order to be saved. A person doesn't have to know   it! What you can say is that if an elder doesn't teach the whole   counsel of God he may be an accomplice in someone's destruction.   And if a person MAY fall short of heaven because of an elder's   neglect in teaching the whole counsel of God, then knowing the   whole counsel of God helps people get to heaven. Hearing it is no   guarantee that you will get to heaven. Not hearing it is no   guarantee that you won't get to heaven. But knowing it is a great   help in getting to heaven. Otherwise Paul would not be liable to   their blood for not teaching it.        The implications of this, for the educational ministry of the   church, are very great. For example, it implies the need for a   unified vision among the teachers of the church of what the whole   counsel of God is. This is one of the reasons why I put a very   high premium on theological harmony among the leadership at   Bethlehem. To the degree that a confused or incomplete or   uncertain vision of the counsel of God is presented by the elders   to the people, to that degree will we not be able to say, "We are   innocent of your blood."        Another implication relates to the children. Our curriculum and   our teaching should serve to build the whole counsel of God into   the minds and hearts of our children in our homes and in our   Sunday School and in our clubs. Every story, every teaching should   serve to make clearer and more powerful the whole over-arching   purpose or counsel of God in history.        Why did God elect his bride the church before the foundation of   the world? Why did he create the universe, and mankind in his   image? Why did he permit the fall into sin? Why did he choose the   nation of Israel? Why did he give them a the law? Why did he have   animal sacrifices and a tabernacle? Why did Jesus come into the   world? Why did he preach the kingdom of God? Why did he die and   rise again. Why did the Holy Spirit come? How is God fulfilling   his purpose and counsel today by calling and regenerating and   justifying and sanctifying a church from every people and tribe   and tongue and nation? How will he bring this age to a close? How   should we then live? What is the unified, whole counsel of God   that holds all this together and gives it meaning?        That is what we ought to be teaching our children --   faithfully, systematically, and with so much life and power that   the beauty of it shines for them.        The first thing to say from verse 27, then, is that knowing the   whole counsel of God helps people get to heaven. Otherwise Paul   would not have said, that he is innocent of their blood because he   taught them this whole counsel.        2. The second thing to say from verse 27 is that people should   want to learn the whole counsel of God. Biblical Christians hunger   to know the whole counsel of God.        This text clearly teaches that elders are deficient and may be   guilty of someone's destruction to the degree that they do not   declare the whole counsel of God. It must follow that the people   of the church are also guilty to the degree that they are not   interested in the whole counsel of God. If not teaching it is a   sin, then not wanting to be taught it is a sin.        So the text clearly implies that Christians should long for the   whole counsel of God the way a baby longs for milk. Once you   understand this verse, disinterest in the whole counsel of God   implies disinterest in the means of salvation. Because the text   says that Paul will be innocent if someone fails to be saved,   because he gave the fullest means of salvation -- the whole   counsel of God.        3. Finally, the last thing to say about verse 27 is that elders   should be courageous in teaching the whole counsel of God.        This idea of courage is implied in the phrase, "I did not   shrink from declaring to you . . ." This means that there are   parts of the whole, unified counsel of God that might make an   elder want to shrink back from teaching them. They might be hard   to understand. Or they might be uncomplimentary to human pride. Or   they might demand radical obedience. And so the elders might be   tempted to declare only part of God's counsel -- the part that is   easy and that they know people especially like. But that would be   a shrinking back from declaring the whole counsel of God. It would   be cowardice not courage.        And that brings us back to the point made at the beginning --   obedient life -- courageous life in this case -- is just as   important as accurate doctrine. For Paul the two were inseparable:   I did not shrink back -- that is, I am a certain kind of person. I   declared the WHOLE counsel of God -- that is, I taught a certain   kind of doctrine. That's what we must aim at together: a   courageously obedient kind of person, and a unified, whole counsel   of God. May God help us as we labor together toward this great   vision.
