    December 31, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor     Prayer Week 1996 : part one     Incentives to Strive in Prayer   (Romans 15:30)           Now I urge you, brethren, by our LordJesus Christ and by the love    of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to Godfor me.         Introduction     Our focus today will be on Romans 15:30. Iam calling the message,  Incentives to Strive in Prayer. The basic point of theverse is to motivate  the Roman Christians to strive or tostruggle or to  fight -- it&#146;s a strong word (not just pray, butstrive or struggle or  fight) -- in prayer to God for Paul as he goes to Jerusalem with acontribution for the  poor Christians of the city. Verse 31 tells what specifically hewants God to do in answer  to their prayer. We will tackle that next week.     But in verse 30 the focus is on two incentivesfor them to struggle in  prayer for Paul as he ministers in Jerusalem. The first isby our Lord Jesus  Christ -- I urge you, brethren,   by our LordJesus Christ  , to  strive together with me in your prayers for me. The secondis by the love of  the Spirit. I urge you, brethren, . . .   by thelove of the Spirit  ,  to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me.    So the basic outline of the verse is simple:there is Paul&#146;s plea  for them to join him in prayer. It is a plea not for casual, laidback, easy-going prayer,  but for striving or struggling in prayer. Then there are twoincentives for them to  respond to this plea. He pleads by the Lord JesusChrist. And he pleads  by the love of the Spirit.     Our goal then is to meditate together on thesethree things: 1) the  plea for Christians to struggle in prayer for the sake ofministry; 2) the incentive  by the Lord Jesus Christ; and 3) the incentiveby the love of the  Spirit.    But first let me describe the setting todaywhere this word from God  hits us.    The setting for this word today is very simplythat today is the  beginning of prayer week, 1996, and (in a few hours) the beginninga new year of praying  and a new year of ministry and I think God wants to speak thisword through me to you  concerning our ministry.           I urge you, Bethlehem, by the Lord JesusChrist and by the love of    the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayer to God for me --and not just for me, but    for the entire mission and ministry of this church.         Fasting as Striving     One way to see prayer as a striving or astruggle is to see fasting  as part of it. Fasting intensifies prayer and says with physicalhunger -- this much Lord  we want you to act. This much we desire your power to come. Thismuch we hunger for the  revelation of your glory in the hearts of your people. This muchwe thirst for the  conversion of perishing friends. And I ask you to consider somesignificant fasting this  week.     But you won&#146;t do that unless you feel howcritical the things are  that I want you to pray for. So let me tell you about mymeditations yesterday. I asked,  Lord, is there anything worth fasting for in our future? Is therea call and dream and a  possibility that you may bring into being through our striving andfasting in prayer in  1996? Why should I fast this year? Why should I ask the people tostrive in prayer?    Here is the answer that created a sense ofcritical need in me and gave  me an excited sense that there is much to lay hold on God for thisweek and this year.          This year, Lord willing, there will emerge a new staffing structure     with significant staff changes (Greg will be moving out intochurch planting, Joan is    moving out of the Minister for Children&#146;s Discipleship, JimBloom will be moving out    of Toshavim and small-group leadership into the urban mission ofInnerChange). How and by    whom these ministries will be sustained is of tremendousimportance. Those decisions will    be made in the next weeks and months, and they are critical.Souls hang in the balance --    children and adult. This is worth a week of striving andprayer!      This year, Lord willing, we will call  newworship leadership . We    have been incredibly fortunate that Don Landin in 1994 and GregDirnberger in 1995 were    willing to help us in interim worship leadership. But now thetask force on worship and    music has worked its way to the point where we are ready tobegin our search for long-term    leadership and my hope and expectation is that by the fall thatleadership will be in    place. This alone, for me personally, is enough to motivatesustained striving in prayer    and earnest fasting until God&#146;s gracious call is heard. Ibelieve many of you feel    this burden as well. I plead with you to strive together with mein prayer and fasting.      This year, Lord willing,  a new vision formember care and oversight    through member ministry and small groups  will crystallizeand shape the way the staff    and elders do their work of spiritual oversight. This could havedramatic impact on staff    roles, and on significance of the eldership and on the priestlyfunction of this    congregation as a whole -- a very exciting Biblical impact! Oneof the historic, biblical    values of Baptists for the last 400 years has been thepriesthood of the believer (1 Peter    2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6; Ephesians 4:12).      This year  the renewed vision of 2000 by2000  moves a crucial    year closer to the date of December 31, A. D. 2000. We believeGod has called us to pray    toward sending 2000 of our people by A. D. 2000 and winning tofaith 2000 people by A. D.    2000. This year there are missionary families waiting to go outfrom us. Will they be able    to go? There are neighbors and friends and colleagues andstrangers that are outside    Christ and perishing if they don&#146;t put their faith inChrist as their Lord and    Savior. Will God give us the power to love them and witness tothem as we ought? And will    he open their hearts to give heed to the word? This itself isenough to fill us with an    urgent longing for God to act in answer to our prayers. Many ofthese people who need    salvation have names and faces. We know them. This is a call forstriving in prayer.      This year, Lord willing, there will be  anew funding plan for paying    off the mortgage on this building  and we will all be calledon in March to join hands    and ask, through our over and above giving would God enable usto cut the remaining six    years on this mortgage in half and save hundreds of thousands ofdollars in interest that    could go to expanding missions and ministries? This possibilityand the eleven weeks    leading up to the Challenge Sunday are worth striving for inprayer.      This year, Lord willing, there will be fresh initiatives  in the    way we cultivate loving relationships here at Bethlehem, and inthe way we do urban    missions and touch the poor, and the way we defend the unborn,and the way we think and    act about race relations. All of that will remain a dreamwithout reality unless there is    striving in prayer to God.      And in support of all this, Lord willing,this year we will see the    completion of  the new parking lot  expansion to the westhere with appropriate    landscaping. God worked remarkably to give us the support of theneighborhood in this a    few months ago, and the house has been removed. Will theresources be there to make it    easier for visitors to come? Striving in prayer will make thedifference.      And in further support of all this therecould be  a new sign  on    the east face of this building identifying the church so thatpeople downtown who are    discussing our roof banners of truth can know how to make aconnection with this church.    But that will cost money, and it isn&#146;t the most importantthing. Will it happen?    Should it happen? Prayer will make a crucial difference inanswering those questions.        Perceiving Critical Need Births Striving inPrayer     That is what I meditated on yesterday as Ipondered my own sense of  urgency and my own call to fasting and to striving in prayer thisweek and through the  year. I mention these things because I know a burden for prayerdoesn&#146;t come out of  nowhere. It comes from seeing a critical need and a great hope. Ifyou don&#146;t feel it  you won&#146;t struggle in prayer. But you  will  feel it tothe degree that your  life is intertwined with this church and you share the mission tospread a passion for the  supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples.    If you are a Christian you all have struggledor will struggle in  prayer. Some of you carry such a burden  for  prayer and in  prayer that you do  this almost daily. Others hardly ever strive in prayer. In factsome of you are having a  hard time even picturing what Paul and I are calling for when wesay, I urge you to  strive together with me in your prayers to God. But there isa time when you all  will strive in prayer.    On December 16 1974 the phone rang and mybrother-in-law told me that  my mother had just been killed I a bus accident and that my fatherwas critically injured  and might not make it. I went to my bedroom and knelt down and forabout half an hour  tasted what it was to strive in prayer. You know what I mean. Youwould do the same thing.  It wasn&#146;t for my mother. It is not biblical to pray of thedead. It was for my  father, that he would live. And he did. Striving in prayer canhappen alone. It can happen  in a group, that stir each other up to strive in prayer. I haveheard our elders strive in  prayer over straying or critically ill saints. Not all prayer isat the same intensity of  striving. But some is very intense. The greater the burden, themore intense.     Striving in Prayer Against Our Enemies     How shall we understand this striving? Inverse 30 Paul does not  say what or whom we are to strive with.           Is it striving against the  sin  inour lives that hinders our      prayers (Psalm 66:18 -- If I regard wickedness in myheart, the Lord will not      hear)?             Is striving against the  unbelief that threatens our faith as      we pray (Mark 9:24 -- Lord, I believe, help myunbelief)?             Is it striving against the  terribledistractions  -- mostly      innocent in themselves -- that keep us from finding time andfocusing in prayer (1 Peter      4:7 -- Be of sound judgment and sober for the purpose ofprayer)?             Is it striving against  Satan  and his principalities   and      powers  (Ephesians 6:12 -- For our struggle is notagainst flesh and blood, but      against the rulers, against the powers)?             Yes, all those enemies and obstacles must bestruggled against. Is it  any wonder that we find prayer as hard as we do. There are so manyopponents. If the enemy  can cut off the power source or the supply line, the whole armylanguishes able to do  nothing.     Striving In Prayer With God     But there is another way to think aboutthis striving in prayer,  namely, with God himself. This doesn&#146;t mean that we think ofGod as an enemy and we  fight him and conquer him. It means we see him as our only hopeand in desperation we take  hold of him and refuse to let him go without a blessing. Examplesof this would be:           Moses  striving with the Lord onbehalf of rebellious Israel      (Deuteronomy 9:24-29).              Hannah  striving with the Lord togive her a son (1 Samuel      1:10,12).              Jesus  striving with his Father inGethsemane, and sweating as      it were drops of blood (Luke 22:44).              Paul  praying with self-sacrificingpassion for his Jewish      kinsmen (Romans 9:1-3; 10:1).            In every case there was an intensity andurgency and earnestness and  zeal and fervor that I think Paul had in mind in Romans 15:30.    Listen to just one example, if you want to knowwhat it may sound like.  This is Daniel crying out to God for the deliverance of his peoplefrom Babylonian  captivity when the 70 years of exile were over. His prayer isintroduced (in Daniel 9:3):  So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek  Him by prayer and  supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. So yousee the visible symbols of  striving in prayer. Now hear the words, as the prayer ends (inDaniel 9:18-19):          O my God, incline Thine ear and hear!Open Thine eyes and see our    desolations and the city which is called by Thy name; for we arenot presenting our    supplications before Thee on account of any merits of our own,but on account of Thy great    compassion. O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen andtake action! For Thine own    sake, O my God, do not delay, because Thy city and Thy peopleare called by Thy name.        He entreats God with earnestness and hewrestles by making a case on  the basis of God&#146;s zeal for his glory.    So I conclude that God calls us from time totime, and some of us as a  kind of vocation, to strive -- to struggle, and wrestle andpersist and prevail in prayer.  This is what I urge you to do this week for all the greatpossibilities that lie before us  as a church an in your own life.     Two Incentives to Strive in Prayer fromRomans 15:30     The incentives Paul gives in Romans 15:30are two: Now I urge  you, brethren, 1)   by our Lord Jesus Christ,   and 2)  by the love of the  Spirit   . . . to strive together with me in prayer.    Take these two briefly one at a time. He callsus by our Lord  Jesus Christ to strive in prayer. What does that mean? Howis this an incentive to  strive in prayer? There are so many things about Jesus that induceus to pray. For  example:          He commanded that we pray and not loseheart (Luke 18:1).            He made his name the basis of our prayers(John 14:13; 15:16).            He shed his blood to purchase all thebenefits of salvation including      answered prayer Romans 8:32).            He taught us to pray with his modelprayer called the Lord&#146;s      prayer (Matthew 6:9-13).            He modeled prayer by spending wholenights in prayer (Luke 6:12).            Which of these does Paul have in mind? Or isthere another?    And what about the second incentive? NowI urge you, brethren, .  . .   by the love of the Spirit   to strive togetherwith me in your  prayers. Does this mean the love that the Spirit creates inus for each other, so  that we want to pray for each other (Galatians 6:22)? Or does itmean the love that the  Spirit himself has for us so that we have confidence that he willhelp us in our praying  (Romans 8:26) and act lovingly in response to our prayers (Acts4:31; 8:15)?    Now all these possibilities are true. And allof them should stir us up  to pray. But here&#146;s my answer to what I think Paul means inboth of these incentives.  I take my cue from the following verse. So this leads us into nextweek&#146;s message.  But let&#146;s do it just briefly. Verse 31 gives the aim of theprayer Paul wants. He  wants them to strive in prayer, he says, that I may bedelivered from those who are  disobedient in Judea, and  that  my service for Jerusalem mayprove acceptable to the  saints.    Two requests: one, that his opponents might berestrained so that they  do not kill him; and two, that the Christians in Jerusalem wouldlook kindly on his  ministry and affirm it rather than criticizing it. My suggestionis that the two  incentives of verse 30 correspond to the two requests in verse31.    To overcome the enemies and keep them in checkso that they do not kill  Paul will require a powerful, sovereign intervention of One howhas the right of  Lord over all the secular powers. This corresponds tothe incentive, By  our Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, I urge you to strivefor my deliverance from  the Roman and Jewish authorities in Jerusalem because Jesus Christis Lord and has the  right and the authority to make the soldiers and governors andCaesar do whatever he  pleases. Pray with confidence that all authority in heaven and onearth has been given to  him (Matthew 28:18).    Finally, the second request is that theChristians in Jerusalem will  look favorably on Paul&#146;s ministry rather than beingsuspicious of him or criticizing  him. In other words he wants them to treat him kindly and gentlyand lovingly. This  corresponds to the second incentive, By the love of theSpirit. Paul believes  that, if the Romans ask the Father in Jesus&#146; name, the Spiritwill lovingly and  powerfully work in the hearts of the Christians in Jerusalem togive them large portion of  his own love to receive Paul and help him in his ministry ratherthan resisting it.     Conclusion: A Call to Strive in Prayer forBethlehem     So that is my plea to you on the brink ofprayer week, 1996. Would  you strive together with me in prayer to God not only on mybehalf, but on behalf of all  the vision that God is creating in these days at Bethlehem. Praythe mission and the  vision and the fresh initiatives using the blue booklet and thegreen kids&#146; sheet  that you will receive as you leave. Pray for great spiritualawakening and revival to  support all these things. Pray in the mornings and be a part ofthe renewal prayer  gathering with Steve Nicholson on Wednesday night, and praythrough the night on Friday.    Whatever you do, don&#146;t be prayerless in1996. Prayer is our hook  up with the power of God for all the mission and the vision andthe initiatives. Strive  together with me in your prayers. I urge you by our Lord JesusChrist and by the love of  the Spirit.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
