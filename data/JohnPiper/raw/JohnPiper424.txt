  November 27, 1994    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       The Dominion Belongs to the God of All Grace    (1 Peter 5:8-14)        Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Youradversary,      the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to      devour. But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the      same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your      brethren who are in the world. And after you have suffered for      a little while, the God of all grace who called you to His      eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm,      strengthen and establish you. To Him be dominion forever and      ever. Amen.             Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard      him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying      that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! She who      is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings,      and so does my son, Mark. Greet on another with a kiss of love.      Peace be to you all who are in Christ.         Why is the Lion Roaring?       Let's jump right into the struggle here with this lion that is   roaring in verse 8. Peter says that the devil is an adversary that   walks around roaring seeking to devour Christians. Now why is this   lion roaring? If a lion wants to eat someone you'd think it would   sneak up on them instead of roaring. In fact that's the way the   devil is described in other places: he's like a snake. It's   subtle. It can fasten onto your heel before you know its there. It   doesn't roar. It hides and slithers.       The devil is like that. He's dangerous sometimes because he is   subtle and quiet and hidden. But that's not the case here. He is   dangerous for other reasons. A lion is dangerous not mainly   because it sneaks, but because it's so strong. Even if you know   it's there, you're a goner unless you have some power more than   your own -- like a rifle, or a gigantic net, or God.       So Peter's point here is not the devil's subtlety or   craftiness, but his power. What power specifically? Verse 9 tells   us: "resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same   experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren   who are in the world." What this says is that the roaring jaws of   the lion are the suffering of believers. Read it carefully and   you'll see this: Resist him . . . knowing that the same   experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren   who are in the world." "Same" -- same as what? "Resist the lion   because the same suffering . . ." The same as you are facing in   the lion. Resist this lion because Christians everywhere are in   this fight -- of suffering. The roaring jaws of the lion are the   sufferings of the saints, designed by Satan for their devouring.       We see a clear picture of this in Revelation 2:10, where Jesus   says to the church in Smyrna,        Do not fear what you are about to suffer.Behold, the      devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that you may be      tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful      until death, and I will give you the crown oflife.         In other words Satan will throw some in prison so that some die   there. But if they are faithful unto death (thus, "resist him firm   in their faith"), they will live for ever -- or as Peter says here   in v. 10, they will be "perfected, confirmed, strengthened and   established."       Which means that successfully resisting the devil does not mean   that he can't kill you. It only means he can't do you any ultimate   harm. He can only kill you. And he can't do that without God's   will (1 Peter 4:19).       Now you can see the difference between Satan as snake and Satan   as lion. His snakelikeness is his indirect sneakiness. But his   lionlikeness is his direct attack in suffering. The hardest thing   about suffering is not usually that it sneaks up on you (though   that can sometimes make it harder, cf. 4:12). The hardest thing   about suffering is that it can overwhelm your faith with fear and   pain. It can destroy your faith that God cares, or has any power   to help, or even exists. That's exactly what Satan wants to   happen, and that's why Peter says the lion is roaring. The roaring   of the lion's jaws is the power of suffering to destroy our faith.       So the point of saying in verse 8, "Be sober, and be on the   alert," is not because the lion might sneak up on you. He's   roaring! The point is that when you fight a lion, roaring with   hunger, you better not be drunk or distracted. You need all your   spiritual faculties.       Who Causes the Suffering?       But this raises some important questions. For example, didn't I   say in the past sermons that the suffering of the Christians is   the judgment of God? 1 Peter 4:16-17,        If anyone suffers as a Christian, let himnot feel      ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God. 17 For it is      time for judgment to begin with the household ofGod.         So the suffering of Christians is God's purifying judgment.   It's a refiner's fire as 1 Peter 1:6-7 says.       But now I am saying that suffering is Satan's attack. Well   then, which is it: the judgment of God or the jaws of the lion?   The answer is: it's both. This is not new. It was both in the life   of Job (cf. Job 1:12, 21; 2:7, 10), and it was both in the life of   Paul. Paul says his "thorn in the flesh" was given to him to keep   him humble (implied, by God). But he calls it a "messenger of   Satan" (2 Cor. 12:7). If God is sovereign over all things,   including Satan, which he is (!), then God has a different   sovereign design in all the designs of Satan than Satan does. When   Christians suffer, the devil's design is destructive pain; but   God's design -- in the same suffering -- is constructive   purification and holiness and power. The devil aims to devour. God   aims to empower and purify and prepare for glory.       Is This War Just a Game?       Now that raises another important question. Can Christians be   devoured? Peter says in verse 8, "Your adversary, the devil,   prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour." So   the devil's aim is to devour. Devour is not scratch or maul or   wound. It's is chew up and swallow. I don't think there is any way   to make this mean anything less than bring to ultimate ruin. The   devil aims to take people with him to the lake of fire.       Now Peter says this is the reason we should resist him. Verse   9: "But resist him, firm in your faith." He's trying to devour   you, so resist him. Now what shall we make of this? Is it just a   charade? No devouring is really possible? Christians can't get   eaten by the devil? They can't go to hell? It's sort of like war   games? The bullets are all blank? But let's fight like their real?       I don't think so. Devouring is real. And resisting is real. And   what is at stake is heaven and hell. Being devoured in hell versus   being merely mauled in prison followed by glory.       So can true, born again, Christians possibly be devoured by the   devil? No they can't, because true born again Christians resist   the devil firm in their faith. That's the meaning of being true   born again Christians, they have the Holy Spirit inside moving   them to fight the fight of faith.       If God says -- which he does say in 1 Peter 1:5 -- that he will   keep us eternally secure by his power through faith, then it is   foolish and presumptuous to say, I am eternally secure without a   life of faith. The promise stands sure in many wonderful passages   of Scripture (Phil. 1:6; 1 Cor. 1:8; 1 Thess. 5:23-24; Heb.   13:20f., Rom. 8:30): God will bring us safely through the jungle   of this world and keep us from being devoured by the devil; and he   will do it by his power through faith. Therefore the person who   says, I believe I am eternally secure, and so I don't need to   resist the devil firm in my faith is contradicting God and   throwing away the warrant of his assurance. Those who are called   by God do not do that. They fight to the end. And that is their   badge of being born of God.       Verse 10 shows us where our assurance is really found.        And after you have suffered for a littlewhile, the      God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in      Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish      you.         What this verse promises is this: if God called you to his   glory, he's going to get you to his glory. A little suffering in   between is not going to stop him.       The meaning of being a Christian is that we have been   effectually called to eternal glory (cf. 1:15; 2:9). This is   Peter's way of saying what Paul said in Romans 8:30: Whom God   calls, he also justifies and whom he justifies he also glorifies.   Peter simply says, The One who called you to his glory will get   you to his glory: he will perfect, confirm, strengthen and   establish you. It's a promise. You can take it for yourself if you   will have it and believe it and bank on it this morning.       And I urge you to take it. When Peter says that "the God of all   grace" makes this promise he wants to help you believe that it's   for you. You may say. It can't be for me. I'm not qualified. I'm   not spiritual. Peter says, you don't start with being qualified.   You start with the God of all grace. Grace precedes qualification.   You may have this promise freely, if you will believe in this God   of all grace.       And he gives one last encouragement to believe it in verse 11:   "To Him -- to the God of all grace -- be dominion forever and   ever. Amen." Dominion means superior strength. God has dominion   over the devil. He is stronger than Satan. Therefore when he   promises to successfully get us through the jungle of this world   and bring us to glory, he can do it and will do it. Dominion   belongs to the Lord.       So when Satan roars with his suffering in your face and   threatens to devour you, don't say, "O, I'm eternally secure, this   is no real threat." Rather say, "The God of all grace has called   me to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, and after I have suffered   a little while from your claws and fangs, he will perfect and   confirm and strengthen and establish me. He is a God of all grace.   He is a God of absolute dominion. You can maul me. And you can   even kill me. But you cannot devour me. He has called me to glory   and he will get me to glory.       That's how to resist him firm in your faith. Take this promise   this advent season. Believe it. Be saved by it. Rest in it. Fight   with it. Persevere with it. It's yours free from the God of all   grace.       Copyright 1994 John Piper     Piper'sNotes
