  February l6, l986 Bethlehem Baptist Church Morning John Piper, pastor Copyright (C) 1986, 1996 John Piper   Blessed Are those who hunger and thirst for Righteousness  Matthew 5:6    Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall  be satisfied.     Some of the most evocative words in the Old Testament come from Ecclesiastes  3:11,     God has made everything beautiful in its time; also He has put eternity into  man's mind, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning  to the end.     What does this mean: that God has put eternity in man's mind and yet has  withheld from us the vision of what He has done from everlasting to everlasting?     St. Augustine said,              Thou madest us for Thyself,           and our heart is restless,           until it rest in Thee.        Restlessness and longing are universal traits of the human heart. George  Herbert, one of the poets I came to love during my college days, wrote a  poem called The Pulley which goes like this:                 When God at first made man,           Having a glass of blessings standing by --           Let us (said he) pour on him all we can;           Let the world's riches which dispersed lie,           Contract into a span.                 So strength first made a way;           Then beauty flow'd, then wisdom, honour, pleasure:           When almost all was out, God made a stay,           Perceiving that, alone, of all His treasure,           Rest in the bottom lay.                      For if I should (said He)           Bestow this jewel also on My creature,           He would adore My gifts instead of Me,           And rest in nature, not the God of Nature:           So both should losers be.                 Yet let him keep the rest,           But keep them with repining restlessness;           Let him be rich and weary, that at least           If goodness lead him not, yet weariness           May toss him to My breast.        God has put eternity in our hearts and we have an inconsolable longing. We  try to satisfy it with scenic vacations, accomplishments of creativity, stunning  cinematic productions, sexual exploits, national sports extravaganzas,  hallucinogenic drugs, ascetic rigors, managerial excellence, etc., etc. But  the longing remains.     Isaiah put it like this in 55:2-3:     Why do you spend your money              for that which is not bread,           and your labor           for that which does not satisfy?           Hearken diligently to me, and eat what is good,           and delight yourselves in abundance.           Incline your ear, and come to me;           hear that your soul may live.        And Jeremiah, like this in 2:12-13:     My people have committed two evils:              They have forsaken me,           the fountain of living waters,           and hewed out cisterns for themselves,           broken cisterns, that can hold no water.             Many of you here this morning are like this. Your soul is hungry and your  heart is thirsty. You feel an insatiable longing for something. You are restless.  Almost everywhere you turn the grass is greener than where you stand. And  the great tragedy for some of you is that even though this is the Spirit  of God beckoning you to himself, you turn away again and again to short-run,  temporary, backfiring pleasures of R-rated video cassettes or movies, or  drugs or alcohol or tanning parlors or a new toy.     And everything turns to ashes in your hands. The thrill of lust leaves the  sediment of guilt and loneliness. The drugs and alcohol can't keep you from  waking up in the real world again and again with your messed-up relationships.  The tan looks so artificial and fades so quickly. And the new toy is so boring  in just a few weeks.     We drink at broken cisterns. And we eat bread which does not satisfy. And  the words of C.S. Lewis ring more and more true. He said,     If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy,  the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.     Jesus has something to say to us this morning about this universal experience  of an inconsolable longing. He has something to say about the insatiable  hunger of the human heart, and about the relentless thirst of our soul.     His words are found in Matthew 5:6 where he says, "Blessed are those who  hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."     What I would like to do is simply meditate with you on two things: l) the  nature of the righteousness that Jesus has in view, and 2) the nature of  our hunger and thirst for it, and how that hunger turns into the satisfaction  which he promises.     First, then what is this righteousness? "Blessed are those who hunger and  thirst for RIGHTEOUSNESS."     Last week we explained the meaning of meekness by going back to Psalm 37:11.  The reason was that Jesus seemed to be quoting that Psalm almost verbatim  in Matthew 5:5. And, besides that, the word "meekness" does not occur again  in the Sermon on the Mount.     But today's beatitude is not a quote from the OT and the word "righteousness"  occurs five times in this sermon (5:6,10,20; 6:1,33). So the best way to  catch on to Jesus' meaning in this sermon is to look at these other instances  of the word righteousness.     But we will only have time to look at a couple. So let's look at the ones  that are closest.     The next use is found in verse 10. "Blessed are those who are persecuted  for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." What does  righteousness mean here when it says "persecuted for righteousness' sake?"     To answer this it helps to see the structure of the beatitudes again. You  recall that there are eight beatitudes with verse ten as the last one and  verse eleven as an expansion of it. The first beatitude (verse 3) and the  last beatitude (verse 10) give the same words of assurance: "For theirs is  the kingdom of heaven." It looks like a kind of sandwich: the top piece of  bread and the bottom piece of bread both say, "Theirs is the kingdom of heaven."     What we didn't notice yet is that there are two groups of four, and the first  four and the second four end with a reference to "righteousness". The first  group of four ends with verse 6: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst  for righteousness." And the second group of four ends with verse 10: "Blessed  are those who are persecuted the sake of righteousness."     The more you ponder it the more significant this becomes. Notice that the  three beatitudes leading up to hunger for righteousness in verse 6 are  descriptions of emptiness or passivity: poverty-stricken in spirit (verse  3), mourning over our sin and our misery (verse 4), meekly accepting criticism  without retaliation or defensiveness (verse 5). These are not characteristics  of overflowing fullness. They are beautiful and good in their proper place,  but they are not yet the richness and fullness and overflowing activity of  goodness that we long for. And so isn't it natural that following these first  three beatitudes the Lord would say, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst  for righteousness" -- those who long to be filled with righteousness.     In other words, after pronouncing a blessing upon those who recognize their  emptiness and grieve over it and don't try to justify or defend themselves,  Jesus now makes a transition from emptiness to fullness by saying that hunger  and thirst for righteousness is also blessed.     Then look at the next three beatitudes. This is just what we find. After  hunger and satisfaction in verse 6 comes, "Blessed are the merciful" (in  verse 7). Now the blessed person is full and overflowing in mercy. He is  not merely broken and sorrowful and meek. He is now active and overflowing  with deeds of mercy. Verse 8 says that he is pure in heart and verse 9 says  that he is not just peaceful, but a peacemaker.     Then this second group of four beatitudes ends with another reference to  righteousness. Only this time it is not a hunger for righteousness which  we were lacking, but a persecution for righteousness with which we are  overflowing.     Do you see the structure? The first four beatitudes describe the broken,  grieving, quiet person who hungers and thirsts for righteousness. And the  next four beatitudes describe the merciful, pure, peacemaker who gets persecuted  for his righteousness. Doesn't this structure then give us the definition  of righteousness? If we were hungering for righteousness in verse 6 because  we were empty, and then we get persecuted for righteousness in verse 10 because  we've been filled, isn't it proper to define righteousness as that with which  we have been filled? -- Namely, mercy, purity, and peacemaking?     Well, let's look at one other use of "righteousness" in the sermon to see  if they confirm this understanding.     In 5:20 Jesus says, "I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Then  what follows in the rest of chapter five are six illustrations of how our  righteousness must surpass the righteousness of the scrupulous law keepers  of the day. In verses 21-26 we must not only not kill, but more, we must  not sustain anger against a brother but seek peace.     In verses 27-30 we must not only not commit adultery, but more, we must not  look upon a person lustfully.     In verses 31-32 we should not condone divorce just because there is a legal  provision for it in the Old Testament. We should surpass the righteousness  that makes peace with hardness of heart and keep our covenant commitments  and not marry those who don't.     In verses 33-37 we should not only keep our oaths, but more, we should be  the kind of people who do not need to take oaths in order to be believed.     In verse 38-42 we should not only not poke out an eye because one of ours  was poked out, but more, we should turn the other cheek and return good for  evil.     And in verses 43-48 we should not only love our neighbor, but more, we should  love our enemy and pray for those who persecute us.     So it is pretty clear what Jesus meant back in 5:20 when he said that our  righteousness must exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees. It has to do  with showing mercy, and being radically pure in your heart, and making peace  instead of retaliating. So our understanding of righteousness from the structure  of the beatitudes is indeed confirmed. Righteousness is showing mercy to  other people; and righteousness is being pure in heart before God who alone  can see the heart; and righteousness is the effort to make peace.     Now there may be much more to it than that. But that seems to be the focus  of these verses and this chapter, and so we will leave our focus on this:  mercy, purity and peacemaking.     The second thing we want to meditate on briefly is the nature of hunger and  thirst and how they turn into satisfaction. "Blessed are those who hunger  and thirst for righteousness."     Let's think about children for a moment. We can learn much about ourselves  by watching the children. You children listen to this too. See if you don't  find yourself in what I have to say. Let me read from G. K. Chesterton who  wrote these words 80 years ago:     We all like astonishing tales because they touch the nerve of the ancient  instinct of astonishment. This is proved by the fact that when we are very  young children we do not need fairy tales: we only need tales. Mere life  is interesting enough. A child of seven is excited by being told that Tommy  opened a door and saw a dragon. But a child of three is excited by being  told that Tommy opened a door. Boys like romantic tales; but babies like  realistic tales -- because they find them romantic... This proves that even  nursery tales only echo an almost pre-natal leap of interest and amazement.  These tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment  when we found that they were green. They make rivers run with wine only to  make us remember, for one wild moment, that they run with water. (Orthodoxy  p. 53f.)     I know this is true because I have been telling stories to my sons for 13  years. We have some imaginary boys named Quintle, Quingy, Quabe and Quarney.  I can remember holding 2 year old Karsten spellbound with a narrative that  would go something like this:     Once upon a time there was a little boy named Quintle. One morning he woke  up very early. He got out of bed and put on his red slippers and his blue  bathrobe and came downstairs to breakfast. There on the plate was a hot egg  that mommy had just cooked. Smoke curled up in the air from it. It was yellow  in the middle and white around the edges, and tasted sooo good. After breakfast  Quintle got dressed and went outside in the sunshine to play, and had fun  all day.     That's all it took. He was spellbound by the romance of reality. But now,  I have to produce accurate descriptions of monsters and weapons with complicated  plots and sound effects. But not with Barnabas, the two-year old. He still  thinks sunshine and smoking eggs and red slippers are really amazing.     What does this mean? Does it mean that the longings we all feel for greener  grass are really longings to go back to that two year old simplicity when  we were awed by the fact that rivers run with water and giraffes have long  necks and eggs are yellow in the middle?     No. That would be like a man who looked at my photograph of the Reformer's  wall in Geneva and said, "O, to return to the day that you stood there and  took that picture! O to be there like you were there and to see those great  towering figures of Calvin and Luther and Zwingli in Geneva!" No. That is  not what we really want. We want the real Calvin and Luther and Zwingli.  We want to be swept up in the realities they were swept up in. We don't want  a great statue. We want the flesh and blood reality of these men and their  cause.     So it is with the world. We don't really want the first thrill of wonder  that rivers run with water. We want the eternal reality behind the river.  The reason the river awakens wonder in us and then leaves us thirsty again  is because the river is just a picture. It is just a pointer. There is a  river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the  Most High. It flows with the water of life, bright as crystal from the throne  of God and from the Lamb.     The hunger and the thirst of your life that cannot be satisfied by anything  in this world is the constant beckoning of God to remember that you were  made for another world, you were made for God.     But let us be very careful at this point. For just here we could make a very  dangerous mistake. We could withdraw from the world. We could become monks  or nuns or forest rangers. But just here is where the words of Jesus become  all-important -- to keep us from making that mistake.     Jesus says that the people who will be satisfied in the end are not people  who have gone off into the woods to find solitary communion with God. Rather  they are the people whose hunger and thirst has been for righteousness, people  who have craved for the grace to be merciful, people who have yearned for  radical purity of thoughts and feelings, people who have passionately desired  to make peace.     And if someone should ask why the promise of satisfaction is made to those  who hunger for righteousness and not to those who simply hunger for God,  there are two reasons.     One is that Jesus surely means God's righteousness -- a righteousness like  God's, and a righteousness that God gives. Matthew 6:33 says, "Seek ye first  the kingdom of God and his righteousness." Surely that is basically the same  as saying, "Hunger and thirst for righteousness." When we hunger and thirst  for righteousness we don't look to the broken cisterns of our own resources.  We look to God. So it is not either-or: we hunger for righteousness in God.     But there is a deeper reason why Jesus promises satisfaction to those who  hunger for God's righteousness instead of promising satisfaction to those  who simply hunger for God.     The Sermon on the Mount ends in 7:22-23 with these words of Jesus:     On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your  name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your  name?" And then will I declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from me,  you evildoers."     They called him Lord. They seemed to have the charismatic gift of prophesy.  They were engaged in exorcisms of demons and miracles in Jesus' name. And  he turned them away at the last day saying he never knew them, because they  were doers of evil and not righteousness.     They thought they knew him. They thought he knew them. But they were strangers:  "I never knew you." Why? Because they had not hungered and thirsted for his  righteousness. They had been religious! They had gone to church. They had  gotten involved in many religious activities. But the passion, the hunger,  the thirst of their lives was not righteousness. And therefore they will  not be satisfied, neither in this age nor in the age to come.     Deep and lasting satisfaction for our souls comes not from the the delights  of the world nor from a merely religious or vertical relationship with with  God. Satisfaction comes from God to those whose passion in life is to know  him in the struggle to be like him in the world (5:48).     So to children this morning I would say, Don't just make believe that you  are that prince who leads his army out against the forces of evil and risks  his life to do what is right and to save the kingdom. Don't just pretend  that you are that captive princess who escapes from the villain's dungeon  and crosses swollen rivers and and snake-infested deserts to warn the king  of danger. Don't settle for the desires of make believe! BE that prince someday!  BE that princess someday! The great tales of the future will be written of  real men and women who were passionately committed to one thing -- the  righteousness of God.     Make it the passion and the hunger and the thirst of your life to do great  acts of righteousness. Don't settle for the little half-hearted satisfaction  of being a millionaire.     And to the rest of us grownups I would say. It is never too late to change  your diet. Do you plan to eat tomorrow? Then why not plan to eat righteousness?.  Do you plan to drink tomorrow? Then why not plan to drink righteousness?     Could it be that one of the reasons the grass is greener everywhere you look  is that your life is not devoted to the central pursuit of righteousness,  but to the pursuit of other things? Let us consider with what regularity  and perseverance and strong urges we pursue food and drink day after day.  And let us make it our prayer that we will hunger and thirst in that same  way to establish righteousness -- in our own souls and in all our relationships  and in our land and in the world.
