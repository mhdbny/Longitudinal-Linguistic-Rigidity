    March 12, 1995   Bethlehem Baptist Church   John Piper, Pastor      THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE    An Introduction to the Series      This new series of messages has been in myheart and on my mind for  a long time -- for several years, at least. I am calling theseries, The greatest of  these is love. What I would like to do this morning is giveyou about ten reasons  why I believe this is what we should focus on for the foreseeablefuture in our preaching  and worship. I&#146;ll begin with the more Biblical andtheological reasons and move to  the more experiential and personal.      1.  1 John 4:8 says, Theone who does not love  does not know God, for God is love. And 1 John 4:16 says,We have come to know  and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, andthe one who abides in  love abides in God, and God abides in him. This is a massiveclaim. And we will have  to come back to it in time to unpack it more fully. But it seemslike the deepest starting  place I could think of for a series of messages on love. God islove. In a word I think it  means something like: God&#146;s absolute fullness of life andtruth and beauty and  goodness and all other perfections is such that he is not onlyself-sufficient, but also,  in his very nature, overflowing. God is so absolute, so perfect,so complete, so full, so  inexhaustibly resourceful, so joyful, that he is by nature aGiver, a Worker for others, a  Helper, a Protector. What it means to be God is to be full enoughalways to overflow and  never to need -- never murmur, never pout. God is love. Theimplications of this for the  way we live are big.     2.  One time a lawyer askedJesus (Matt. 22:36),  Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law? Inother words, tell us  what is the most important commandment of all the hundreds of OldTestament commandments?  Jesus answered, You shall love the Lord your God with allyour heart, and with all  your soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and foremostcommandment. But  then the lawyer got more than he bargained for. Jesus didn&#146;tstop. He said, (in Matt.  22:39), The second is like it [an utterly key phrase for usnow!], You shall  love your neighbor as yourself. The second reason for aseries of messages on love  is that Jesus said loving each other is like loving God. The twocommandments are  inseparable. We need to study that too. But for now just marvel atit, and let it motivate  you to be engaged with this quest we are setting out on. The greatcommandment is: Love  God with all you are. The commandment to love your neighbor islike it.     3.  In the very next verse,Matthew 22:40, Jesus says,  On these two commandments depend the whole Law and theProphets. Everything  else hangs on these commands of love. Whatever else there is inthe Christian faith and in  the life of obedience, it all hangs on this. But even more amazingis what Paul says in  Romans 13:8-10, Owe nothing to anyone except to love oneanother;  for he who  loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law . (9)For this,&#145;You shall not commit  adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall notcovet,&#146; and if  there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying,&#145;You shall love your  neighbor as yourself.&#146; (10) Love does no wrong to a neighbor;love therefore is the  fulfillment of the law. Here Paul is willing to say thatlove of neighbor is a  fulfilling of the law -- he doesn&#146;t mention loving God. Wewill need to ask why. But  the point here is that love between humans is so crucial that Paulsays, when it really  happens it is the fulfilling of all God&#146;s teachings.      4.  In Galatians 5:6 Paul says,In Christ Jesus  neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faithworking through  love. Faith working through love. What thisverse means is that love is  the way faith expresses itself and proves in life that it is real.Without love faith is  dead. This is what James meant when he wrote, Faith, if ithas no works, is dead,  being by itself (James 2:17). So the works of love are theevidence of living faith.  Without them a church is dead and a heart is dead. Here&#146;s theway John put it in 1  John 3:14, We know that we have passed out of death intolife, because we love the  brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Where loveis absent faith is dead  and we are dead -- no matter whatever else is happening.     5 . In John 13:34-35 Jesussays, A new  commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as Ihave loved you, that you  also love one another. (35) By this all men will know that you areMy disciples, if you  have love for one another. I personally like it when peopleput fish symbols on  their cars and wear crosses and put Hope in God signsin house windows -- but  if you ask Jesus: what&#146;s the mark of a Christian that willset them off and help the  world know that they are your disciples, his answer would be --his answer was -- By  this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have lovefor one another.  Love for each other in the church is the badge of Christianity.    In the book of Acts Luke is eager to show thatone of the first effects  of salvation and community life in Christ is practical, costlycare for one another. Acts  2:45: They began selling their property and possessions, andwere sharing them with  all, as anyone might have need. In other words, meeting needs inthe church was more  important than personal possession. This is very God-like. Recallhe is so full and  content that he is by nature LOVE -- giving, caring, helping,supporting, protecting. Love  among Christians is the mark of Christ in the church. By this willall men know that you  are my disciples.     6.  In 1 Timothy 1:5 Paul tellsus what he aims at in  all his teaching: The goal of our instruction is love from apure heart and a good  conscience and a sincere faith. In all his teaching, and allhis late night  instruction and all his study with the books and the parchmentsthe aim was love. Yes from  a pure heart, and yes, from sincere faith in Christ (no lovewithout it!), but still the  aim of it all was a loving church. And that means the aim of allmy preaching and the aim  of all your study and reading and discussing must be love.    The last four reasons become more contemporaryand contextual and  experiential and urgent and personal.     7 . In Matthew 24:9-12 Jesusgave a description of what  the last times would be like. He described them in terms of hateand love. He said,           They will deliver you to tribulation, andwill kill you, and you    will be hated by all nations on account of My name. And at thattime many will fall away    and will deliver up one another and hate one another.  [Sothere will be hatred from    the outside and hatred on the inside of the church.]  Andmany false prophets will    arise, and will mislead many. And because lawlessness isincreased, most people's love    will grow cold.        So it feels to me like there is a kind ofendtime urgency to this  series of messages. Hate will be multiplied from the outsideagainst the church. Hate will  increase inside the church as one betrays another to theauthorities. And love,  everywhere, will grow cold.    Now with all my heart I believe this direprediction does not have to  be your destiny, or the destiny of this church -- or even thiscity. That it is going to  be true far and wide does not mean it has to be true for anyparticular person or church.  But if it is not to be, we must know the forces against us. Itwill be like a spiritual  glacier moving over the world and the church. Love will surviveand thrive where we  consciously torch the glacier with the power of Christ and theHoly Spirit with a view to  loving each other rather than hating each other. It will be anuphill battle, against many  forces. May God give us grace, partly through these messages, totorch the glacier of  coldness and hate.     8 . Our nation is permeatedwith a spirit of varying  degrees of hatred and rancor and mean-spiritedness. It ranges fromnazi-like skin heads  declaring open hatred for Jews and any non-whites, to childrenkilling their parents, to  gangs dealing almost entirely in a tone and atmosphere of anger,to radio talk-shows that  capitalize on people&#146;s unseemly love for cutting cleverness,to politicians who know  that the sound bite is not long enough for a fair consideration ofthe alternative view,  and who, therefore, choose the most emotionally loaded phrase todemonize and undermine  not only the viewpoint of the other side, but also the characterof its proponent. Every  day the newspaper documents a nation of hate and meanness.       Which more and more brings to mind the words ofthe Scripture (2 Tim.  3:1-5):            But realize this, that in the last daysdifficult times will come.    For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,arrogant, revilers, disobedient    to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable,malicious gossips, without    self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous, reckless,conceited, lovers of pleasure    rather than lovers of God; holding to a form of godliness,although they have denied its    power; and avoid such men as these.          Do you see the words that grip me: revilers,ungrateful, unloving,  irreconcilable, malicious, haters of good. It&#146;s verycontemporary. Our nation is in  desperate need of another way to relate.       I would like to encourage as many of you aspossible to read two  articles in the  Christianity Today  magazine dated March 6,in our library. One is  by John Woodbridge of Trinity Seminary, called Culture WarCasualties: How Warfare  Rhetoric is Hurting the Work of the Church. This was a veryconvicting essay for me  to read. It came as a strong affirmation from the Lord that thisseries of messages is  appointed for this time. It raised the question of how Christianscan show the whole  Biblical Christ to the world when aspects of our Christianmorality have become so  politicized that we tend to relate to the world almost entirelyaround issues  -- like abortion and homosexuality -- and therefore in a verycombative atmosphere,  because the emotions run so high, when you are talking, forexample, about the taking of  the life of unborn children, and whether homosexual people maypromote their practices in  public schools. And so we become defined in terms of issues thatare volatile. And these  so called culture wars are fast becoming more like warand less like culture  -- with real bullets and not just hard words.    The other article I would love for you to read,even more than that  one, is a reprint of Francis Schaeffer&#146;s The Mark of aChristian also in  this same issue of Christianity Today from last week.Schaeffer&#146;s challenge was even  more convicting to me than Woodbridge&#146;s. The burden of hisarticle was how Christians  can disagree, when they must disagree, with visible, manifest,love. He posed a question  that comes as close as anything to setting the agenda that I thinkwe are called to in  this series of messages. Here&#146;s what he said:         We have conferences about everything else.Who has ever heard of a    conference to consider how true Christians can exhibit inpractice a fidelity to the    holiness of God and yet simultaneously exhibit in practice afidelity to the love of God    before a watching world? Who ever heard of sermons or writingsthat carefully present the    practice of two principles that at first seem to work againsteach other: (1) the    principle of the practice of the purity of the visible church inregard to doctrine and    life and (2) the principle of the practice of an observable loveand oneness among  all     true Christians?         This is what I want to struggle with and diginto and grow in. I want  us to have and to be a word from God for our nation concerning howdisagreeing groups love  each other. I have mush to learn. I certainly do not have all theanswers, especially in  the politically loaded atmosphere of the culture wars of oursociety. But together I think  God will guide us and grow us and humble us and make us strongwith a kind of strength  that combines the holiness and love of God in new ways that wehave not known before.       9 . Inside the church we havedifferences that call for  deep and real and relentless love toward one another. Shaeffer, inthat article on  The Mark of a Christian, said that this is our goldenmoment.          It is in the midst of difference that we haveour golden opportunity.    When everything is going well, and we are all standing around anice little circle, there    is not much to be seen by the world. But when we come to theplace where there is a real    difference and we exhibit uncompromised principles but at thesame time observable love,    then there is something that the world can see, something theycan use to judge that these    really are Christians and Jesus has indeed been sent by theFather.       Let me mention three goldenopportunities for us at  Bethlehem -- and I really do see them as that.          1) The differences in the way we judge theloss of the organ last year    -- the way I and the elders and the staff handled it. Here is agreat call for love. The    issue is complex and revolves in large measure around this veryissue of what love is and    how it works under different circumstances. Perhaps the Lordwill give us fresh insight if    we give ourselves to study and prayer and heart-searching, notonly about what love called    for in the past, but what it calls for now as we view the past.I thank God for the love    and grace that many of you have shown toward me. No pastor canlive without it, because    James 3:2 says to teachers, We all stumble in manyways.            2) There are the differences among us in whatwe find helpful in    worship. What kind of music? What kind of instruments? What kindof singing? What kind of    atmosphere? These differences are threatening the unity and loveof churches all over the    world. It&#146;s what they wanted to talk about in Brazil when Iwas there last October.    Here is a golden opportunity to learn love and show love in themidst of difference. The    key question is not just what should worship look like, but whatshould love look like    among Christians who don&#146;t agree on what worship shouldlook like.      3) There are the differences between theurbs and the    burbs. Some live in the city and some live in thesuburbs, and some in    between. Some eat and drink urban ministry. Others think indifferent categories, also    with a ministry orientation. Here is a golden opportunity tolearn love and to show love.             How easy it would be, as Schaeffer said, ifwe all thought the same on    all these things. But as it is, in the real world, we havegolden opportunity for love. I    hope I can be a good shepherd during these days of discovery andgrowth in love.        10.  Finally, the tenth reasonfor a series of messages  on love is that I long personally to grow in love. I take heartfrom the apostle Paul that  love is not an all or nothing affair. It is something you can growin. So he prays in  Philippians 1:9, I pray, that your love may abound stillmore and more in real  knowledge and all discernment. That&#146;s what I want, as Iget older.     I am keenly aware that no man on his death bedever looked up into the  eyes of his family and friends and said, I wish I&#146;dspent more time at the  office. What love looks like for a pastor is not an easyquestion. I ask for your  prayers and I ask for your patience.     Let me close with one illustration of my ownstruggle and what I am  learning. For the past two weeks I have been isolated in my studyworking to finish the  book,  Living by Faith in Future Grace.  Hundreds of you werepraying, and by the  grace of God it is basically finished.     As I put the finishing touches on it Fridaynight the pressing question  for me personally was, Is this a work of love? Is it aloving thing to isolate  myself from people in this way and deal with ideas and words?Here&#146;s what I think the  Lord showed me. That way of loving the church and the world willbe authenticated or not  by the other ways of loving people that I am called upon toperform as husband, father,  friend, pastor, leader. It&#146;s like what we saw in Isaiah 58:Your fasting on Sunday  will be shown to be authentic by the way you treat your workers onMonday. Each different  occasion for love in our lives adds to or subtracts from theauthenticity of love in all  the other areas of our lives.    May the Lord use these weeks in his loving wordto fulfill in us  Paul&#146;s word in 1 Corinthians 16:14, Let all that you dobe done in love.    Copyright 1995 John Piper    Piper'sNotes
