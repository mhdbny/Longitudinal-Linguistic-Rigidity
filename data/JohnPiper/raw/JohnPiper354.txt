 August 2, 1992    Bethlehem Baptist Church    John Piper, Pastor       OLYMPIC SPIRITUALITY    "Beyond the Gold," Part 1    (1 Corinthians 9:23-27)         And I do all things for the sake of the gospel,      that I may become a fellow partaker of it. Do you not know that      those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the      prize? Run in such a way that you may win. And everyone who      competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.      They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an      imperishable. Therefore I run in such a way, as not without      aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; but I buffet      my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have      preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.                When Paul wrote these words to the Corinthian Christians he   assumed that they all knew about the games. The Olympic Games took   place in Greece every four years without interruption from 776   B.C. until they were suppressed by the Emperor Theodosius in A.D.   393. That's 1,169 years. Everyone knew about the games. So Paul   didn't have to explain the games. Everybody was aware of the games   then. And everybody is aware of the games today.        What Paul did with the games--just like he (and Jesus) did with   everything else in life--was to see them in relation to God. Paul   was so saturated with Christ and the gospel that he couldn't see   anything without thinking of how it related to eternity and the   great issues of the Christian life.        So he took the games and he taught the Christians to transpose   them into a different level, and to see in the games a reality   very different than everyone else is seeing. He said in effect,   "The games are played at this level of reality. They run at this   level. They box at this level. They train and practice and deny   themselves at this level. They set their sights on gold at this   level.        "Now I want you to see all that at another level. I want you to   transpose the temporary struggles and triumphs of the Olympic   Games onto a different level of reality--the level of spiritual   life and eternity and God. When you see the athletes run, see   another kind of running. When you see them boxing, see another   kind of boxing. When you see them training and denying themselves,   see another kind of training and self-denial. When you see them   smiling with a gold medal around their neck, see another kind of   prize."        That's what Paul was trying to do in this text for the   Christian Corinthians, and that is what I am trying to do this   morning for you. I want you to transpose what you see and hear   into a different key. Every time you turn the television set on I   want you to hear God talking to you through the games. If I   understand Paul in this text the games in Barcelona are meant to   be seen and heard by Christians as a tremendous impulse to fight   the fight of faith and run the race of life with nothing less than   Olympic passion and perseverance.        The reason I take two weeks on this text is not just because   the Games last that long, but because there are at least two   tremendously important things that demand our attention in this   text.        One is the prize, the crown, the finish, the triumph. What is   it? What's at stake in the race of the Christian life? What are we   to run for and fight for? And is that OK? To have a great prize in   view as we fight the fight of faith?        The other thing in this text that needs our attention is the   running itself. How then shall we run? What is it to exercise   self-control? Are we to buffet and pommel our bodies and make them   our slaves? What does this look like in real life? And how do you   do it if you are weak and lying in the coronary care unit of   Abbott-Northwestern Hospital or tied to a bed with a broken hip at   age 95 at Augustana?        Today we look at question one: What is at stake in this race?   What is the prize and the crown?        Paul gives the answer to this question in four different ways   in four different verses. In two of them he talks about what is at   stake in the way he runs his own race. And in two of them he talks   about what's at stake in the way the Corinthians run the race.   It's the same thing for both. He wants them to see what's at stake   is the prize. And he uses himself as an example. He is in the race   with them.        1. First in verse 23 he comes to the end of his description (in   verses 19-22) of how he is willing to become all things to all men   in order to save some (v. 22), and he sums up this passion for   people and for the gospel like this: (v. 23) "And I do all things   for the sake of the gospel, that I may become a fellow-partaker of   it."        There's the first description of what is at stake in the way   Paul runs the race of his life. ". . . that I may become a   fellow-partaker of the gospel." ". . . that I might have a share   in the gospel." ". . . that I might obtain what the gospel   promises."        Now what the gospel promises is salvation--salvation from sin   and death and hell. "The gospel is the power of God unto salvation   for all who believe" (Romans 1:16; cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-2). So what   Paul is saying is this: "I live for the sake of the gospel--I   preach it and become all things to all people, not only that they   might be saved, but that I might inherit the same salvation with   them. He said the same thing to Timothy in 2 Tim. 4:16, "Take heed   to yourself and to your teaching, hold fast to that; for by so   doing you will save both yourself and your hearers."        God has called Paul to preach the gospel. Whether he does or   not is evidence of his living relationship to Christ. It is   evidence of whether he has been born of God and given a new heart   of love to Christ. And therefore what hangs on Paul's running in   the path of obedience and his fighting the fight of faith is the   reality of his own standing in grace, his own participation in the   gospel.        If he quit running, if he said, "I've had enough of this life   of service; I'm through with following the path of obedience to my   heavenly call; I'll try to hang on to Christ for the forgiveness   of my sins, but I'm done with doing what he says,"--if Paul quit   like that, and never came back, he would be lost. He would not get   the prize of salvation. He would be disqualified from the race and   sent away in shame--like a sprinter guilty of unlawful   steroids.        2. That's what Paul says in verse 27, which is the second way   he describes what is at stake in the race of life. He says, "I   buffet my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have   preached to others, I myself should be disqualified."        Paul will warn the Corinthians in the next chapter (10:12),   "Let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall." Now   Paul applies it to himself. "If I do not take heed, if I give way   to some of the impulses of my body, I could find myself on the   slippery slope of disobedience away from Christ, and get to the   end of my life and hear the judge of the race say, 'Disqualified!   Yes, you prophesied in my name. Yes, you cast out demons in my   name. Yes, you did many mighty works in my name. But you left the   race track of faith and love and righteousness. You are   disqualified. Depart from me. I never knew you (Matt.   7:22-23).'"        The best evidence perhaps that this is what Paul means is the   use of the word "disqualified" (adokimos) in 2 Corinthians 13:5.   Paul says, "Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith;   examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves,   that Jesus Christ is in you--unless you are disqualified." The   word is exactly the same one from 1 Corinthians 9:27.        To be disqualified means that Christ is not in you. The race   has been run in vain. It was a sham. Now Paul does not believe   that is true about his own heart. And he means to make his whole   life a living demonstration that Christ is in him and Christ is   mighty to save. The way he runs and the way he fights is not   because he doesn't have Christ and hopes to have him, but because   he does have Christ and means to show it to the world.        The beautiful way he puts it in Philippians 3:12 is, "Not that   I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect, but I   press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was   laid hold of by Christ Jesus."        The running and the fighting of the Christian life is a running   and fighting for eternal life (1 Tim. 6:12--"Fight the good fight   of faith; take hold of eternal life.") But it is a race and a   fight in the confidence that we have been taken hold of by Christ   for that very life. Our running and our fighting, with all its   pain, is proof that the Christ who ran his race and fought his   fight and endured his cross for the joy (the prize) set before him   is alive and real in our hearts.        So Paul uses himself and his own race twice to show what is at   stake in the way we run and fight. Now he says the same thing when   he mentions twice what is at stake in the way the Corinthians run   their race.        3. Verse 24: "Do you not know that those who run in a race all   run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you   may seize it." Run to win the prize.        The word for "prize" is used one other time in the New   Testament, namely, in Philippians 3:14. "I press on toward the   goal of the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus." Not   to get the prize is not to go to heaven.        So when Paul says, "Run in such a way as to win the prize,"   heaven hangs on this running. That's why next week's message is so   crucial. What is it? How do we do it?        4. The fourth description of what is at stake in our running is   mentioned in verse 25. "Everyone who competes in the games   exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a   perishable wreath, but we an imperishable." The prize is an   "imperishable wreath."        The word is stephanos, crown and the closest parallel to this   use of crown is 2 Timothy 4:7-8 where Paul mentions the race and   the fight just like he does here in verse 26. "I have fought the   good fight, I have finished the course (race), I have kept the   faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of   righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge will award to me   on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved   His appearing."        The "imperishable crown" is the righteousness that finally fits   us for heaven. We don't have it yet. We still sin. We repent. God   forgives. But we fight and we run in the pursuit of righteousness   (Hebrews 12:14). We hunger and thirst for righteousness with the   confidence, Jesus says, that "we shall be satisfied" (Matt. 5:6).   We do not run in vain!        And so the conclusion this morning is this: the Christian life   is an awesomely serious affair and the stakes are infinitely high.   What you do with your life--the way you run your race and fight   your fight--will make the difference between sharing in the   promises of the Gospel or being disqualified. It will make the   difference between attaining the prize of the upward call of God   in Christ, or not. It will make the difference between receiving   the unfading crown of righteousness or not. Life is serious   business.        You will see in Barcelona this week the path of discipline and   pain that athletes are willing to pursue for one gold medal and an   hour in the glory of human praise. I urge you as you watch to   transpose what you see from games into ultimate reality. Above all   remember this: what God offers you and pledges to you in the   gospel and in the prize and in the crown is 10,000 times more   valuable than all the gold in Barcelona.
